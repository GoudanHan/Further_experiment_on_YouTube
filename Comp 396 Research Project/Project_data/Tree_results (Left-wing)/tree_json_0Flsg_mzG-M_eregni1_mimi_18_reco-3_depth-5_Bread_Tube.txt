They focus on their beliefs that beauty isn\u2019t linear, cosmetics shouldn\u2019t be for the privileged, and makeup is a mere enhancement of who you are, not a completion of you!  In 2012, Melissa launched The Lip Bar because she was incredibly frustrated with the beauty industry. Why were most cosmetics filled with unnecessary chemicals? Why did lipsticks only come in a limited range of colors? And more importantly, why was the depiction of beauty so damn linear?\n\nMelissa started making lipstick in her kitchen because I believed beauty shouldn't compromise health and because she was determined to not change the way she looked to fit into some superficial or trendy beauty standard. \n\nShe's not passionate about makeup. She's passionate about creating an inclusive narrative on what beauty is and reminding women that they don't have to settle for anything. \n\nToday, The Lip Bar products are found at retailers nationwide and Melissa's mission to challenge the current standard of beauty by creating a lipstick experience that is unsurpassed in craftsmanship, quality and color continues.

She soon discovered a new passion: helping women look and feel their best.  Lately she has focused on bringing makeup artistry and acting together by documenting the diverse stories of the women who sit in her makeup chair and then bringing them to life on stage.  Her mission is to convince every woman that she is beautiful -- with or without makeup.   Eva's acting credits include Law and Order: Criminal Intent, Saturday Night Live, and All My Children.  She holds a BFA in Musical Theatre from The New School University in NYC.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.

                        "description": "In this insightful talk, sociologist Julie Hogan demonstrates the concept of cultural humility.  She explores how differently Americans respond to her when wearing two traditional robes:  Muslim burka and academic regalia.  Dr. Hogan deep dives into cultural competence, deconstructs the prevailing paradigm, and offers cultural humility as a richer more meaningful way to understand not only the culture of others, but American culture as well. Dr. Julie A. Hogan is an associate professor at the University of Nevada Reno\u2019s College of Business. Hogan earned her doctoral degree at the University of Nevada Las Vegas in Sociology. She earned her master\u2019s degree at the University of California Chico when Pioneer Days (a university sanctioned week long alcohol and drug party) was broadcast on MTV. She has spent 30 years in the substance abuse prevention field, has amassed a whopping 38 million dollars in grants and contracts, and has three textbook publications.\n\nFor 30 years, Hogan has been deeply engaged in the topic of culture. Over the past ten years, she has been embracing diversity through the framework of cultural humility. In August of 2015 she met a student who changed her life. After experiencing some socially rich observations in the classroom, Hogan accepted a gift that changed the way she views American culture and herself.

She fills us in on the real harm that these do to our psyches and proposes some smart solutions.\n\nCarrie Hammer started her career as an advertising sales executive and often heard that she should \u201cdress for the job she wanted not the job she had.\u201d This was tough advice to follow as she found a limited selection of fashionable, professional women\u2019s clothing with a contemporary fit. As a solution, she felt she had no choice but to start a line to cater to the underserved professional woman. CARRIE HAMMER launched in 2012 in New York City to critical acclaim to deliver stylish professional wear to women.\n\nHammer\u2019s passion extends beyond fashion to empowering women inside and outside of the workplace. This was exemplified in her debut fashion show during New York\u2019s Fashion Week in February, 2014 where she featured \u201cRole Models Not Runway Models,\u201d and included the first ever model in a wheelchair on the runway. Hammer and her clothing line have been featured on CNBC, Fox Business News, Forbes, Good Morning America, Elle, Marie Claire, and Cosmopolitan, to name a few.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The team's strategy is to \"commandeer\" the molecular machinery that regulates stem cell self-renewal and proliferation and, in doing so, stimulate tissue regeneration even in people whose own repair mechanisms aren't working well.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

She went on to complete her M.F.A at the New York Academy of Art, Graduate School of Figurative Art in 2001. She teaches and lectures at universities and institutions nation wide, and is an adjunct professor at the New York Academy of Art.\n\n\"My intention is to transfer the intimacy and vulnerability of my human experience into a painted surface. I like mine to be as intimate as possible, each brush stroke like a fossil, recording every gesture and decision.\"  \n\nMonks's paintings have been the subject of numerous solo and group exhibitions including \"Intimacy\" at the Kunst Museum in Ahlen, Germany and \"Reconfiguring the Body in American Art, 1820-2009\" at the National Academy Museum of Fine Arts, New York. Her work is represented in public and private collections, including the Savannah College of Arts, the Somerset Art Association and the collections of Howard Tullman.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The \nchronic focus on beauty directs cognitive, financial, and emotional \nresources away from other more important goals. Dr. Engeln considers whether there is hope for treating the epidemic of beauty sickness and what it might be like to live in a world where women feel free to spend less time in front of the mirror and more time changing the world. \n\n\nDr. Engeln is a psychology professor and body image researcher at \nNorthwestern University. She is the author of \"Beauty Sick: How the \nCultural Obsession with Appearance Hurts Girls and Women\" (Harper, \n2017).

Imagine how different things would be if we paid more attention to this unique emotional pain. Psychologist Guy Winch reveals how recovering from heartbreak starts with a determination to fight our instincts to idealize and search for answers that aren't there -- and offers a toolkit on how to, eventually, move on. Our hearts might sometimes be broken, but we don't have to break with them.\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

Since it's raining well here, I thought I'd post today instead of later. I also really like this one, and I hope you guys do too.\nThis video has six suggested songs in it: Lights, Heartbeat, Love is Not Over, Still With You, Your Eyes Tell, and Stay Gold. I really enjoy adding songs that you guys suggest in my videos, so if you want any in the next one, feel free to comment below. I really value your opinion and intake for the videos I put out, so don't be afraid to leave a little message :)\nI hope you guys enjoyed the video, and as always, if you have any video suggestions or songs you want in, type them in the comments ad I'll be sure to get back to you. Credits go to the artists who made and perform the songs in this video, and credits go to the person/persons who made the art I used as the background. Timestamps will be in the comments, and if you have any questions, make sure to ask. Have a wonderful day, and stay happy and healthy \ud83d\udc9c\n\nRain sounds used: ",
