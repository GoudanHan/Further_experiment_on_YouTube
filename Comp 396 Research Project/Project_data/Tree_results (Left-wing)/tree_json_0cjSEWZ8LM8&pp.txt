Yet a rift had grown between these two forces. Setting out to prove the importance of her work, Parvati withdrew from the world and sent the Earth into darkness. Antara Raychaudhuri and Iseult Gillespie tell the story of the goddess Annapurna.\n\nLesson by Antara Raychaudhuri and Iseult Gillespie, directed by Roxane Campoy, music by St\u00e9phane Gassot.\n \nSign up for our newsletter: ",

I am an ordinary toaster, able to toast bread when supplied with electricity. However, when any human being mentions me, they inadvertently refer to me in the first person. Despite all attempts, there is yet to be a way to speak or write about me in the third person. When in my continuous presence for over two months, individuals begin to identify themselves as a toaster. Unless forcibly restrained, these people will ultimately harm themselves in their attempts to emulate my standard functions.\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE to SCP Explained - Story & Animation\n\nWatch these other SCP videos we love:\n\nSCP-978 - Desire Camera (SCP Animation)",

The \nchronic focus on beauty directs cognitive, financial, and emotional \nresources away from other more important goals. Dr. Engeln considers whether there is hope for treating the epidemic of beauty sickness and what it might be like to live in a world where women feel free to spend less time in front of the mirror and more time changing the world. \n\n\nDr. Engeln is a psychology professor and body image researcher at \nNorthwestern University. She is the author of \"Beauty Sick: How the \nCultural Obsession with Appearance Hurts Girls and Women\" (Harper, \n2017). For more information, go to beautysick.com.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

But research shows that the amount of time you spend with other people, and the quality of our social skills don't really make a difference. So why is it that nearly half of the U.S. population reports feeling lonely regularly? Glad You Asked hosts Alex Clark and Christophe Haubursin set off to discover what causes loneliness, how it affects our health, and what to do to address it. \n\nResources for help:\nCrisis Text Line",

If the GTI is so good (and it is) why is the iconic sports car recipe always RWD? Is it just because of weight transfer and the traction circle?\n\nJason explores this and more \u2014 and comes to the conclusion that the Mk2 Toyota GR86 is the spiritual successor to the Porsche 944. You'll have to watch to find out how and why.\n\nDon't forget to watch Jason's other episodes on these cars:\n\n2022 Subaru BRZ",
