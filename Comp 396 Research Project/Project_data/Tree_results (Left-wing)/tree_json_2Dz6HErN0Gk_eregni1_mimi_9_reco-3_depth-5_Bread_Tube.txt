The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, an associate editor at The Washington Post, shows how the president makes decisions on major foreign and domestic policies. Drawing from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand sources, contemporaneous meeting notes, files, documents, and personal diaries, FEAR brings to light the most explosive debates that drive decision-making in the Oval Office, the Situation Room, Air Force One, and the White House residence. It\u2019s the inside story on President Trump as only Bob Woodward can tell it. Don\u2019t miss this opportunity to hear first-hand as the legendary journalist sits down with the chairman and editor-in-chief of Slate.\n\nRecorded on September 12, 2018 at 92nd Street Y.\n\nSubscribe for more videos like this: ",

It's quite a balancing act for Bhutan's citizens.\n\nNo other country has recently undergone more radical change than Bhutan. The millennium brought television, the internet and democratization to the last Himalayan kingdom almost overnight. The capital Thimphu has become one of South Asia's fastest growing cities. At the same time, just a few kilometers to the north, 20 thousand nomads still live from herding yak on the high plains of the Himalayas. This documentary tells of the challenges these people face. \n\nWe meet young Chewang , who often has to leave his family for months and trek to heights above five thousand meters in search of the caterpillar fungus, a fabled medicinal mushroom. We also follows the journey of five-year-old Doryi, who is separated from his poverty-stricken family when they send him to a monastery. Meanwhile, the committed organic farmer Choki is trying to bring the advantages of modern life to her village. And 73-year-old bowman Ap Chimi is finding the modern world quite a challenge, so he's decided to compete in his last archery tournament to show youngsters in the village that he can still hit the bull's eye as easily as they do.\nThis documentary takes viewers on a trip through a time that mirrors Western development in the last century. The loss of a communal life in harmony with nature is juxtaposed against the gains made through globalization. Director Irja von Bernstorff, who has made her home in the Happy Kingdom, gives us a unique peek behind the country's tourist fa\u00e7ade to reveal what makes the wondrous world of Bhutan so special.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

And splashing cash on anything she wanted was never a problem. She was loaded. Caddick always looked a million bucks in her designer clothes, she travelled first class everywhere, and called a stunning Sydney mansion home. She claimed her wealth was the result of her brilliance in business, and generously for her friends and family, she offered to share her financial secrets. The deal she proposed to them was simple: if they trusted her with their retirement savings, everyone would win. But it was a lie. Eleven weeks ago, Melissa Caddick and twenty million dollars of money that wasn\u2019t hers suddenly vanished.\n \nTom Steinfort reports the latest developments in the police search for Caddick; traces her last known moments before she disappeared; interviews the former friends who were duped after entrusting her with their hard-earned savings; and asks Caddick\u2019s husband, Anthony Koletti, about the accusations against his wife.\n\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

                    "description": "Germany is one of the world\u2019s richest countries, but inequality is on the rise. The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind. \n\nFor the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gr\u00f6ner, one of Germany\u2019s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. \"If you have great wealth, you can\u2019t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts. \"Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we\u2019re more independent,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanovi\u0107, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. \"These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,\" Milanovi\u0107 notes. \"Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?\u201d\n\nPart 1: ",

At 19, she claimed to have invented a miniaturised machine that with a single drop of blood could map a person\u2019s health quickly, reliably and cheaply. She boasted that her technology meant serious diseases like cancer would be prevented before they happened. And it was not only a \u201cwow\u201d moment for patients. High-profile investors rushed to pour a fortune into Holmes\u2019 company, Theranos, and she became Silicon Valley\u2019s first self-made female billionaire. But as Tara Brown reports, her invention was an invention \u2013 it simply didn\u2019t work. Elizabeth Holmes is no visionary. She\u2019s a cruel fraudster who has put people\u2019s lives at risk, and because of that, now faces 20 years in jail.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

With BTS cooped up in Seoul, the group held true to the series's spirit by convening a live band for its Tiny Desk debut, and even arranged to perform in a workspace with a music-friendly backdrop: the record store VINYL & PLASTIC by Hyundai Card in BTS's hometown.\n\nOpening with this summer's inescapable \"Dynamite\" \u2014 the group's first single to hit No. 1 in the U.S., as well as its first song to be fully recorded in English \u2014 BTS leaned hard into the new track's celebratory, \"Uptown Funk\"-adjacent vibes. From there, the group dipped into its back catalog, seizing on the opportunity to showcase its quieter side while (mostly) staying uncharacteristically seated. The breezily propulsive \"Save ME,\" from 2016, ultimately gave way to a full-on power ballad in 2017's reflective \"Spring Day.\"\n\nThe latter track seemed especially true to BTS's hopeful nature: Introduced with a few optimistic words from rapper and singer RM (\"It's been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come\"), the song reflects on a need to wait out hard times, even as the weight of present-day pain feels oppressive.\n\nBTS had intended to spend 2020 delighting the BTS Army in arenas around the world, only to spend these last few months performing in isolation. Released on the last day of a grim season, \"Spring Day\" provides a nice reminder of what awaits us on the other side. We just have to get through fall and winter first.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Dynamite\"\n\"Save ME\"\n\"Spring Day\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJ-Hope: vocals; SUGA: vocals; Jungkook: vocals; V: vocals; Jin: vocals; RM: vocals; Jimin: vocals;  KHAN: drums; DOCSKIM: keyboard; Kim Kiwook: bass; Shyun: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo and Audio by: Big Hit Entertainment; Producer: Stephen Thompson; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Subtitles by Renee Klahr; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n\nABOUT THE SERIES\nThe Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.",

Bring a book, your work, or fall asleep with this relaxing ambience video. Watch the heavy rain outside the windows and listen to the soothing sounds of smooth jazz playing in the background. This relaxation video is 8 hours long so you can play it all day while you work or through the full night if you plan to use this as a cafe sleep ambience video. Listen closely and you will hear subtle ambient cafe sounds like hushed conversation and clinking dishes from the other coffee shop customers. ",

I know a lot of people are still stuck inside at the moment due to covid, so I wanted to create an ambience to transport you to a fancy restaurant in New York.\n\nEnjoy this 3 hours calming restaurant ambience, which includes soft Jazz music, relaxing rain sounds and very light restaurant chatter. The couple dining are enjoying dessert / coffee, while rain hammers on the window against the bustling city backdrop. \n\nHope you enjoy :)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f How i made this video \ud83c\udfa4\n\nFor this video I commissioned a talented 3D designer, to bring my restaurant design to life. I then used adobe premiere pro and after effects to create the animations.\n\nWith the exception of the Jazz music (see below) and the intro quotes, all audio is original recording using the Sony PCM-D100 microphone.\n\nEquipment / software i use\n* Mic - Sony PCM-D100 Mobile DSD/LPCM Recorder\n* Adobe Premiere pro\n* Adobe after Effects \n\n\u00a9\ufe0f Re-use of this video / audio is not permitted\n\n \ud83c\udfb5Jazz Music\ud83c\udfb5\n\nThe list of Jazz songs used in this video is provided below :) I have a licence to use all Jazz songs with a subscription to Epidemic Sound.\n\n* \u2018Almost Summer\u2019 by Franz Gordon \n* \u2018Some who cares\u2019 by Franz Gordon\n* \u2018Seeing you again\u2019 by Almost here\n* \u2018Meline\u2019 by Cornelio\n* \u2018Gone to soon\u2019 by Bladverk Band\n* \u2018I won\u2019t give you up\u2019 by Almost here\n* \u2018Here and now\u2019 by Bladverk Band\n* \u2018Midnight Serenade\u2019 by Bladverk Band\n* \u2018What a little smile can do\u2019 by Oakwood Station\n* \u2018Seven Falls\u2019 by Hara Noda\n* \u2018Swimmer\u2019 by Hara Noda\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
