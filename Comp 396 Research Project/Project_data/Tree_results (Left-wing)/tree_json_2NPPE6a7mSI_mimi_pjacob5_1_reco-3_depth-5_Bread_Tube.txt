The half-submerged boat can be seen as passengers are being rescued.\n\nThe boat ran into trouble and capsized shortly after 8 pm due to a powerful thunderstorm, according to multiple reports.\n\nFRED has strengthened to a tropical storm status as it is barrelling towards Florida. Meanwhile, Storm Grace heads for quake-hit Haiti.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Fred regained its tropical storm status in the Gulf of Mexico early Sunday as parts of the Caribbean were gearing up for impacts from Tropical Storm Grace.\n\nFred was forecast to move across the Gulf before reaching the coast Monday night or Tuesday morning, forecasters said. They said people from Alabama to the central Florida Panhandle should monitor the system's progress.\n\nA tropical storm watch was issued from the Alabama/Florida border to Ochlockonee, Florida. Fred's maximum sustained winds stood at 40 mph (65 kph) Sunday morning.\n\nAnticipating Fred, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for the state's Panhandle region. And Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey issued a statement Saturday saying her administration was monitoring the weather and will be ready to act from the state level if needed.\n\nFred's remnants were located early Sunday about 350 miles (565 kilometers) south-southeast of Pensacola, Florida, and moving north-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).\n\nThe hurricane center said 3 to 7 inches of rain were expected across the Florida Keys and southern peninsula by Monday, with isolated maximums of 10 inches.\n\nContinue reading\nMonsoon rain \u2018kills two\u2019 amid flash flooding in Arizona as Florida braces for Tropical Storm Grace & fires rage in Cali",

The former soldier touched on the efforts of the military, aid workers, journalists and others before noting: 'I know that we've all been struggling and if this recall has done one thing... I've spoken to the Health Secretary, he's already made a commitment to do more for veterans' mental health.' Fellow MPs applauded their colleague as he finished the emotive message and took to social media to praise the former soldier.\n\nOriginal Article: ",
