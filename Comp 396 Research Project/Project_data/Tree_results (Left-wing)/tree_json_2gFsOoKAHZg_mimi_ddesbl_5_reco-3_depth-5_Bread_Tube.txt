I just wanted to get this out quickly.I used the DSI flipnote studio animation program instead of the new 3ds version which is why things look a bit choppier than usual. It doesn't have a built in convert to .Avi feature so I had convert into a gif. Then convert the gif into a .mp4 then convert then put the music in using movie maker which is what I usually do anyways but the conversions left it out of time with the song. So all those hours trying to painstakingly match everything to the beat was wasted. I tried i guess. \nI should just re do this in flipnote studio 3d. This could be a good draft to work off of.",

There's always more that I can say. I just can't stop talking about it.\n\nAlso Charlie Tango, Eurocopter EC135, is played in the film by a Eurocopter EC130 because Seattle noise laws prohibit civilian use of a helicopter as large as the EC135 within city limits.

During the extremely needed bath, which she hates, I lost control of her head and she managed to latch onto my arm and break the skin with two teeth. It looked kinda rough, so I figured I should get a tetanus shot in the morning. By the time the clinic opened I was in some of the worst pain of my life, the swollen bite looked like a tennis ball was embedded inside my arm, and the selling was pressing constantly against my ulnar nerve. The pressure was so intense that I could feel gravity pulling on my skin and fingers. Anyway, that's a big part of why this is late.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: ",

There's dimensions to watching the film that I can't convey fully in a condensed video, like how stop-start the plots are, how Henry gets sick and the movie basically stops what it was doing for twenty minutes waiting for him to die, and how watching the film is to go through a rolling process of trying to figure out what the film is trying to actually tell you. People who are familiar with Jurassic World should catch the similar ways that Book of Henry demonizes a woman for not behaving exactly and precisely as the mother figure that the filmmakers think she should be. Susan gets off light, though, since she isn't executed by dinosaur for the crime of texting.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nTwitter: ",

Uh oh. Why did I do this\n\nI've gotta change my avatar I actually really don't like bananas. Maybe I hate them because of this game. Or maybe it's because one time I ate some rotten pizza and it tasted just enough like banana that I gag. Lol I wrote all all of this and you read it. The internet is a miracle.\n\nPatreon: ",
