But to get to the war-torn country\u2019s tremendous mineral wealth, Beijing is forced to trust the Taliban. \n\nMeanwhile RT America\u2019s John Huddy reports on the emerging partnerships in the region. Tobin Smith of Transformity Research joins Scottie Nell Hughes to share his insights. He argues that China and the Taliban \u201cplay the long game\u201d and that the US \u201cplays the short game\u201d at a heavy price. \n\nThen Steve Malzberg, host of \u201cEat the Press,\u201d joins Scottie Nell Hughes to discuss Twitter\u2019s apparent hypocrisy in allowing spokespeople for the Taliban to make use of the platform and Washington\u2019s failure to reign in the power of social media platforms to manipulate the public discourse and selectively silence its users. \n\nPlus, RT America\u2019s Natasha Sweatte reports on new breakthroughs in the development of fusion power before RT America\u2019s Trinity Chavez reports on Jeff Bezos\u2019 bringing suit against NASA for being \u201cimproper and unlawful\u201d in its coveted Moon-landing contract to Elon Musk of SpaceX. \n\nWatch Full Episode on Portable.TV",

The new Olympic champion broke her own world-best mark of 51.90, storming past compatriot Dalilah Muhammad down the home straight to win the Olympic gold medal in 51.46 seconds. Muhammad - the Rio 2016 Olympic champion - took silver, going under 52 seconds in a time that also broke the former world record (51.58). Femke Bol of the Netherlands finished third in a new European record of 52.03.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\ud83d\udc49 News from the Olympic world: ",

With breathtaking speed, the Taliban swept across the country, meeting little resistance as they marched into Kabul to declare the dawn of the \"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan\".\nAs armed fighters took control the streets of the capital, thousands fled to Kabul airport in a desperate attempt to flee the country \u2013 resulting in chaos and death on the runway. Western countries are scrambling to evacuate diplomats and local Afghan staff. A humiliating debacle for an alliance that had promised to bring freedom and democracy to a land that has known little but war for more than 40 years.\n\nSubscribe: ",

I believe that the lofi community is the best on internet, and I appreciate your feedback and support. If you like my songs, you can use them in your videos too, and don't forget to add my social links ( youtube & spotify ).\n\n\u2b50 Clear instructions about using my lo-fi songs \u2b50\n1) All songs are SAFE to be used in ANY of your videos, nobody will strike your video.\n2) In case you need to monetize the video using my songs, send the video link to my label at soundinvasionrecords@gmail.com - They will check if you added my credits in the description, and release any claim. Make sure you send them an email only in case your channel is approved to monetize, otherwise it makes no sense.\n3) Again, the music is SAFE to be used in your videos. If you get a claim, it is NOT a copyright violation.\n\nSpecial thanks to ChilledCow, Dreamy, the bootleg boy, Ambition and The Jazz Hop Cafe for inspiring me to create this chill lofi beats. You are great!\n\n#aesthetic #lofi #studymusic",
