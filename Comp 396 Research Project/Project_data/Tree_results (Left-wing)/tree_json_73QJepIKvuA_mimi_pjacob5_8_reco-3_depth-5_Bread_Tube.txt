                        "description": "Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat served in Afghanistan and gave a powerful speech in the Commons, sharing his experiences, as he said the current situation felt like a defeat. The former soldier touched on the efforts of the military, aid workers, journalists and others before noting: 'I know that we've all been struggling and if this recall has done one thing... I've spoken to the Health Secretary, he's already made a commitment to do more for veterans' mental health.' Fellow MPs applauded their colleague as he finished the emotive message and took to social media to praise the former soldier.\n\nOriginal Article: ",

Kevin Hart and Travolta dive into the differences between actors now vs. actors back then. \n\nNew episodes dropping every week! Up next: Bryan Cranston and Nick Cannon.\n\nSynopsis: Armed with his insatiable curiosity, lightning wit, and vintage wine, Kevin Hart sits down to interview A-list guests in the comfort of his virtual wine cellar for an uninterrupted hour of insight, truth, enlightenment, and of course, some humor. Hart to Heart will dig deep to find out what makes these world-class influencers tick, their goals and aspirations, their journey to stardom, and the obstacles they overcame to reach their lofty status.",
