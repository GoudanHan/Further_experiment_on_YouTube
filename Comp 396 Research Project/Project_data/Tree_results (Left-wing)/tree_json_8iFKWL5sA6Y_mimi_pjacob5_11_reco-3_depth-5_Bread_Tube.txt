                    "description": "The battle between parents and Gov. Ron DeSantis over mask mandates in schools is expected to continue in court today. \n\nOn Aug. 6, attorneys in the Tampa Bay area filed a lawsuit challenging DeSantis' executive order banning schools from enacting mask mandates. \n\nThe lawsuit says DeSantis' ban violates the Florida Constitution, which grants decision-making power to local school boards. \n\nCharles Gallagher, a St. Petersburg attorney and father of two school-aged daughters, said at the time the 67 school boards across the state are very different from one another. Each district should be given the authority to make the decisions that are best for their communities.\n\nDeSantis has been firm in giving parents the freedom to send their children back to school in a mask, and his executive order puts an effective ban on school districts from mandating them. The potential consequence of violating that order is the loss of funds equivalent to each respective school district's superintendent's salary.\n\nOn Monday, attorneys representing DeSantis, Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran and the Florida Department of Education filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit, saying the lawsuit doesn't have legal grounds because the argument over mask mandates in schools should be between school districts and DeSantis, not parents, per the Constitution.",

She was born and raised in Southern California. Cindy is disabled and cannot work. She receives Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits, but it's not enough to rent an apartment. \n\nCindy lived a nomadic-lifestyle for many years, but now at 63 years old, van life is not sustainable. Cindy needs her own bed. An apartment to call home for her and her dog. Homelessness is also isolating. Cindy needs community, and while van life did provide a community for many years, after COVID, everything has changed. Cindy feels alone living in the van. \n\nElderly homelessness was a crisis before the pandemic. It's going to get much worse unless we fix the affordable housing crisis and other causes of homelessness. \n\nYour voice can help end homelessness. If we do not fix the affordable housing crisis, homelessness will continue to get worse. Click here ",
