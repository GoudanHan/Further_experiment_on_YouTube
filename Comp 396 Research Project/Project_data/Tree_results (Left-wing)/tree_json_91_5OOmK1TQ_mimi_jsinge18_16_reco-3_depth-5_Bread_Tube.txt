The thesis of the talk I gave: Millennials don't exist and the entire idea of \"generations\" is unscientific, condescending, and stupid. For more misconception destruction, check out my show ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING on TruTV!\n\nUPDATE: Since making this video, I've met Jean Twenge, who let me know that she felt I had misunderstood (and thus misrepresented) some of her research. I'm always eager to hear from an expert - which Jean genuinely is on this topic - so we sat down for a special episode of the Adam Ruins Everything podcast to talk about Jean's research on generations and my reservations about the term. Enjoy! ",
