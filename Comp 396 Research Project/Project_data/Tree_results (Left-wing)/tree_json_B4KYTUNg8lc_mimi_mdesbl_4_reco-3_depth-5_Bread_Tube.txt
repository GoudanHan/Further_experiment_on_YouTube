Imagine how different things would be if we paid more attention to this unique emotional pain. Psychologist Guy Winch reveals how recovering from heartbreak starts with a determination to fight our instincts to idealize and search for answers that aren't there -- and offers a toolkit on how to, eventually, move on. Our hearts might sometimes be broken, but we don't have to break with them.\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

                    "description": "The Beatles 1 Video Collection is out now. Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nHey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles longest-running No.1 in the US singles chart as well as the single with the longest running time.  \n\nThe Beatles did not record their promotional film until Hey Jude had been on sale in America for a week. They returned to Twickenham Film Studio, using director Michael Lindsay-Hogg who had worked with them on Paperback Writer and Rain. Earlier still, Lindsay-Hogg had directed episodes of Ready Steady Go! And a few months after the film for Hey Jude he made The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special that featured John and Yoko but wouldn\u2019t be shown until 1996\n\nTo help with the filming an audience of around 300 local people, as well as some of the fans that gathered regularly outside Abbey Road Studios were brought in for the song\u2019s finale. Their presence had an unlikely upside for The Beatles in their long-running saga with the Musicians\u2019 Union in that the MU were fooled into believing the band were playing live, when in fact they were miming for the vast majority of the song. Paul, however, sang live throughout the song.\n\nThe video was first broadcast on David Frost\u2019s Frost On Sunday show, four days after it was filmed. At that point transmission was in black and white although the promo was originally shot in colour. It was first aired in America a month later on 6 October 1968, on The Smotheres Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nConnect with The Beatles:\nFacebook ",

                "description": "\"Here, There and Everywhere\" es una canci\u00f3n escrita por Paul McCartney (pero acreditada a Lennon/McCartney), grabada por los Beatles para su \u00e1lbum Revolver de 1966. En su biograf\u00eda, Many Years From Now, McCartney es citado diciendo que la canci\u00f3n es una de sus favoritas. George Martin, productor de los Beatles, tambi\u00e9n ha mencionado que es una de sus canciones favoritas de Paul McCartney.\nLa canci\u00f3n es conocida por su tonalidad agridulce, por su armon\u00eda y por su sutil arreglo. La melod\u00eda alegre es contrarrestada por los fascinantes c\u00f3digos menores del puente. McCartney, de hecho, mencion\u00f3 en la serie de radio de 1989, McCartney On McCartney, que el comienzo de la canci\u00f3n con los coros de \"ooh-aah\" en el fondo, estaba planeado para tener un sonido como el de los Beach Boys.\n\nEsta canci\u00f3n presenta uno de los rangos vocales m\u00e1s altos de McCartney; \u00e9l dijo en su autobiograf\u00eda que de hecho estaba tratando de cantarla al estilo de Marianne Faithfull.Recientemente, David Gilmour, guitarrista de Pink Floyd, grab\u00f3 una versi\u00f3n de esta canci\u00f3n para la revista Mojo. Esta ser\u00e1 incluida en un CD, junto a la edici\u00f3n correspondiente al mes de Octubre del 2015.\n\n\"Here, There and Everywhere\" is a song written by Paul McCartney (but credited to Lennon / McCartney), recorded by The Beatles for their album Revolver, 1966. In his biography Many Years From Now, McCartney is quoted as saying that the songIt is one of their favorites. George Martin, Beatles producer, has also mentioned that one of your favorite songs of Paul McCartney.\nThe song is known for its bittersweet tone, for its harmony and its subtle arrangement. The cheerful melody is offset by lower fascinating bridge codes. McCartney, in fact, mentioned in the radio series 1989, McCartney On McCartney, to the beginning of the song with the chorus of \"ooh-aah\" at the bottom, was planned to have a sound like the Beach Boys.\n\nThis song has one of the highest vocal ranges McCartney; he said in his autobiography that he was actually trying to sing in the style of Marianne Faithfull.Notable performers have covered \"Here, There and Everywhere\" including Bobbie Gentry, Locksley, Emmylou Harris, Camilo Sesto (on their first album in English), Clay Aiken, Jose Feliciano (instrumentally), The Lettermen, John McDermott, Celine Dion (for a tribute album to George Martin / Beatles), George Benson, Perry Como, Sissel Rita Lee and John Denver.\n\nRecently, David Gilmour, Pink Floyd guitarist, recorded a version of this song for the magazine Mojo. This will be included on a CD, along with the corresponding edition to October of 2015.",
