Polls close at 8 pm AT / 7pm ET.\n\nLiberal Leader Iain Rankin, who assumed the role of premier earlier this year from outgoing leader Stephen McNeil, called the election in hopes of winning his first majority in the job as polls showed the Liberals with a strong lead over the other parties, in part due to their handling of the pandemic. \n\nHowever, as the campaign draws to a close, the lead the party held has narrowed and the result could come down to party organization in crucial ridings and with 55 seats up for grab after a 2019 redistribution, Rankin also has to try and grab some of the new seats as he would need 28 seats to get a majority. \n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/8103639/no...\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #nspoli #NovaScotia",
