He said two C-17s would make regular flights into Kabul to \u201csupport evacuation efforts.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said there have been fewer flights over the past few days than he \u201cwould have liked\u201d because of the difficulty in securing planes flying out of Kabul and ensuring the safety of personnel. \n\n He said the Taliban has blocked access to the Kabul airport for Afghans wanting to leave the country, but that the government would continue its work to evacuate people from the city. Trudeau said his government is working to ease \u201call the barriers\u201d faced by Afghans hoping to flee the country.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",
