It announces what\u2019s wrong and assures us that others have noticed, too. It encourages us to come together \u2013 first to ridicule politics\u2019 failings, then hopefully to overcome them \u2013 and it\u2019s deeply funny while doing so. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver is great satire, doing all this and more. Oliver uses his status as someone with one foot outside the U.S., one foot inside, to lodge an outsider\u2019s uncompromising critique with the care of someone who needs to live here. And freed from commercial breaks, he capitalizes on the ability to maintain focus and go for the kill, at times offering the best, most cogent explanations of complex issues, at times becoming an investigative journalist as skilled at interrogating his target as any Progressive Era muckraker. His impact is evident in the astounding effect he had on the net neutrality debate, with the FCC receiving 45,000 new comments in the days following his telecast on the topic. His resolve not simply to explore headline news, but to pull back the proverbial curtain and show us the subtle mechanics at work in our nation\u2019s democracy and culture is to be commended. For bringing satire and journalism even closer together, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver receives a Peabody Award.\n\nLink: ",

But experts say there\u2019s more food inflation to come.\n \n\u201cWhen we ask about affordability, the NDP seems to do better than any other party on that issue,\u201d says Ipsos polling CEO Darrell Bricker.\n \nIpsos polling including food inflation ranks among Canadians top election \n\nissues particularly among millennial and generation-Z voters, who now make up 40 per cent of the population and who were instrumental with getting Justin Trudeau elected in the past.\n \nAnne Gaviola reports.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",
