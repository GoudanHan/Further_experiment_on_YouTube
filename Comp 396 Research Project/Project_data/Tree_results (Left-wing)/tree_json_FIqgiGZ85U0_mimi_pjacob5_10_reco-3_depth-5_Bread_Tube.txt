According to sources, staffers in two House buildings are being asked to relocate. The Senate and House are not in session, and most lawmakers are not in their offices.\n\nKEEP READING: https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/loc...",

As it gets ready to lead the country once again.\nIn its first news conference since taking Kabul on Sunday, the Taliban promised to protect women's rights, give amnesty to those who worked with foreigners and respect media freedoms.\nIts leaders also said they will not let other groups use Afghanistan to launch attacks on any country.\nAnd they've called on women and other minorities to join their government.\nBut many Afghans and world leaders are skeptical.\n\nSo, has the Taliban changed its ways?\n\n\nPresenter: Mohammed Jamjoom.\n\n\nGuests:\n\nFahim Sadat - Head of the International Relations Department at Kardan University.\n\nMichael Semple - Practitioner Chair at the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\n\nOmar Samad - a former Afghan Ambassador to France and Canada and a former Adviser to Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah.\n\n- Follow us on Twitter: ",

A calm and beautiful selection of recordings I made for you during the past years. \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find more calm piano music also on my YT channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find my music is also on:\nSpotify:   \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailySpotify\n\nApple Music:    \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailyAppleMusic\n\nrelaxdaily Instagram:      \nhttps://www.instagram.com/relaxdaily/\n\nweb: https://relaxdaily.net\n\nI hope you enjoy the music and have a calm and wonderful day in your style, at your pace.\nMichael (relaxdaily)*\n\nFor new music videos (and 24/7 music streams) see: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily (tick the notification bell when subbing if you like to receive notifications on new music)\n\nThis relaxdaily project (= me creating calm music) can be nourished via Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/relaxdaily\n\n*If you\u2019re new to my music project: I\u2019m Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. \n\nI believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",
