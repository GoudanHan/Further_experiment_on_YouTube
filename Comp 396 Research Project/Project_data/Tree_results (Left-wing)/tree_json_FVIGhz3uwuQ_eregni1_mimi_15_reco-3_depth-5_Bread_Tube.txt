His extreme activism initiatives, such as the \u201cTrash Me\u201d campaign he ran in New York in 2016, are meant to awaken our consciousness on the impact our actions have on the planet. Rob invites us to commit to small daily changes to become the change we wish to see in the world.\n\nRob Greenfield is an adventurer, environmental activist, humanitarian, and dude making a difference. He is dedicated to leading the way to a more sustainable and just world. His activism creates eye-catching visuals that inspire people to self reflect on how they can make positive changes in their lives to be a part of the solution to our current environmental and social problems. He lives a near zero waste lifestyle with just 111 possessions to his name and donates 100% of his media income to grassroots environmental non-profit organisations.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Based out of South Central L.A., The Ron Finley Project seeks to bring a new way of thinking and new opportunities to people in urban communities through gardening.   Simply put, he wants everyone to just \"grow some shit\"!\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

Daisy Scholte learns people how to decrease this type of waste. \n\nShe has definitely set her mind on this mission and she won\u2019t stop. Not wasting food for her is a way of life and work. She really cares and tells to as much people as possible that in the Netherlands alone we waste around 1/3 of the food that is available to us. And that must be stopped. \n\n\nDaisy Scholte tells people not to waste food. For her it's a way of life as well as her job, and she works hard to reach her goals. \u201cDay and night if I have to\u201d, she says. \u201cNobody asked me to write a book... Nobody paid me to write a book... And nobody warned me how tough it is to write a book. I'm not going to get rich and famous, now my book has been published. I didn't do it for those reasons. I did it because I care and because I'm passionate about the subject of food waste.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Tama has advised and worked with schools, conservation groups and private individuals to assess, steward and restore natural landscapes on their properties.\n\nTama recently authored the book Foraged Flavor: Finding Fabulous Ingredients in your Backyard or Farmers Market about her several year project with the chef de cuisine at Restaurant Daniel in NYC to turn edible \"weeds\" from nature in to delicious cuisine.  Tama has lectured about food and nature across the country and has led educational programs for schools, conservation groups, foodies and homeowners.

But nearly half of all plastic produced goes towards single-use items such as bags, straws, utensils and takeout containers. Since the 1950s, humans have produced about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic. Every year, 8 million metric tons end up in the ocean. Globally, only 9% of plastics are recycled. As the waste piles up, there's a growing demand for alternatives. \n\nThere's a number of companies trying to develop cost-efficient and eco-friendly substitutes, from mushroom packaging to advanced fibers and plastic-free online shopping. But it may take serious legislative efforts to incentive adoption and slow the rise of the industry overall.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",
