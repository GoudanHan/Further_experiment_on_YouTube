Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nHey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles longest-running No.1 in the US singles chart as well as the single with the longest running time.  \n\nThe Beatles did not record their promotional film until Hey Jude had been on sale in America for a week. They returned to Twickenham Film Studio, using director Michael Lindsay-Hogg who had worked with them on Paperback Writer and Rain. Earlier still, Lindsay-Hogg had directed episodes of Ready Steady Go! And a few months after the film for Hey Jude he made The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special that featured John and Yoko but wouldn\u2019t be shown until 1996\n\nTo help with the filming an audience of around 300 local people, as well as some of the fans that gathered regularly outside Abbey Road Studios were brought in for the song\u2019s finale. Their presence had an unlikely upside for The Beatles in their long-running saga with the Musicians\u2019 Union in that the MU were fooled into believing the band were playing live, when in fact they were miming for the vast majority of the song. Paul, however, sang live throughout the song.\n\nThe video was first broadcast on David Frost\u2019s Frost On Sunday show, four days after it was filmed. At that point transmission was in black and white although the promo was originally shot in colour. It was first aired in America a month later on 6 October 1968, on The Smotheres Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nConnect with The Beatles:\nFacebook ",

Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nHey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles longest-running No.1 in the US singles chart as well as the single with the longest running time.  \n\nThe Beatles did not record their promotional film until Hey Jude had been on sale in America for a week. They returned to Twickenham Film Studio, using director Michael Lindsay-Hogg who had worked with them on Paperback Writer and Rain. Earlier still, Lindsay-Hogg had directed episodes of Ready Steady Go! And a few months after the film for Hey Jude he made The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special that featured John and Yoko but wouldn\u2019t be shown until 1996\n\nTo help with the filming an audience of around 300 local people, as well as some of the fans that gathered regularly outside Abbey Road Studios were brought in for the song\u2019s finale. Their presence had an unlikely upside for The Beatles in their long-running saga with the Musicians\u2019 Union in that the MU were fooled into believing the band were playing live, when in fact they were miming for the vast majority of the song. Paul, however, sang live throughout the song.\n\nThe video was first broadcast on David Frost\u2019s Frost On Sunday show, four days after it was filmed. At that point transmission was in black and white although the promo was originally shot in colour. It was first aired in America a month later on 6 October 1968, on The Smotheres Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nConnect with The Beatles:\nFacebook ",

Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nWritten by John as an expression of his love for Yoko Ono, the song is heartfelt and passionate. As John told Rolling Stone magazine in 1970, \u201cWhen it gets down to it, when you\u2019re drowning, you don\u2019t say, \u2018I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me,\u2019 you just scream.\u201d\n\nDuring filming on the roof of Apple, two days after the recording of the track, the band played \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 right after doing two versions of 'Get Back\u2019 and it led straight into 'I\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u2019. Michael Lindsay-Hogg was once again directing a Beatles\u2019 shoot. He and Paul met regularly at the tail end of 1968, while Hogg was directing The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, to discuss the filming of The Beatles\u2019 session in January. By the time that fateful Thursday came around, the penultimate day of January would be the last time The Beatles ever played together in front of any kind of audience.\n\nThis is not the version of \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 heard on the single but the version from the Let It Be\u2026 Naked album \u2013 a composite of both versions that were performed on the roof of Apple in Savile Row\n\nOfficial site: ",

Get your copy here: http://thebeatles1.lnk.to/DeluxeBluRay\n\"In We Can Work It Out, Paul did the first half, I did the middle eight. But you've got Paul writing, 'We can work it out, we can work it out' - real optimistic, y'know, and me impatient, 'Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend'.\" (John Lennon)\n'We Can Work It Out' became The Beatles' sixth single in a row to top the US charts. At the time, no other band had achieved such success. The track took over 11 hours to perfect - up to this point, that was the longest period The Beatles had spent in the studio on a single song. \nAt Twickenham Film Studios, a little over three weeks after the single was recorded, The Beatles made three separate promo films for 'We Can Work It Out'. Like all the other films shot that day, the medium was two-inch black and white videotape, a relatively new format for the time. Many TV stations, however, weren't set up for videotape, so 16mm copies were made for distribution worldwide.\nYou can find out more and pre-order at ",

Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nHey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles longest-running No.1 in the US singles chart as well as the single with the longest running time.  \n\nThe Beatles did not record their promotional film until Hey Jude had been on sale in America for a week. They returned to Twickenham Film Studio, using director Michael Lindsay-Hogg who had worked with them on Paperback Writer and Rain. Earlier still, Lindsay-Hogg had directed episodes of Ready Steady Go! And a few months after the film for Hey Jude he made The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special that featured John and Yoko but wouldn\u2019t be shown until 1996\n\nTo help with the filming an audience of around 300 local people, as well as some of the fans that gathered regularly outside Abbey Road Studios were brought in for the song\u2019s finale. Their presence had an unlikely upside for The Beatles in their long-running saga with the Musicians\u2019 Union in that the MU were fooled into believing the band were playing live, when in fact they were miming for the vast majority of the song. Paul, however, sang live throughout the song.\n\nThe video was first broadcast on David Frost\u2019s Frost On Sunday show, four days after it was filmed. At that point transmission was in black and white although the promo was originally shot in colour. It was first aired in America a month later on 6 October 1968, on The Smotheres Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nConnect with The Beatles:\nFacebook ",
