After surviving years of torture as a prisoner of war, Louis (Samuel Hunt) returns home from World War II, where he meets and marries Cynthia (Merritt Patterson). Haunted by his past, he is driven deep into despair. But when Cynthia turns to God at the 1949 Billy Graham Crusade, her most fervent prayer for Louis is to find peace and forgiveness. Based on Laura Hillenbrand's bestselling book, Unbroken: Path to Redemption is a \"beautiful, beautiful film\" (Kathie Lee Gifford, Today Show).",

Told in the eyes of Charles Templeton, the film proceeds in showing Billy Graham\u2019s life as a teenager during the great depression living at the family dairy farm in Charlotte, North Carolina. During this time, Graham is seen becoming a Christian at a tent revival meeting. Later, Graham is seen going to Bob Jones College, which is now Bob Jones University, but Graham goes to Florida Bible Institute after being identified as a failure by Bob Jones, Sr. Following his time at Florida Bible Institute, Billy Graham goes to Wheaton College where he falls in love with his Wheaton classmate Ruth Bell to whom he ultimately gets married. In the 1940s, Charles Templeton, becomes a really close acquaintance of Billy Graham; however, Charles Templeton, who is a young, gifted preacher, leaves his faith when he is challenged by scientific skepticism, leading Graham and Templeton to part. Billy continues to evangelize in his crusades and believe that the word of God is infallible. The film finishes with Graham inviting his listeners to accept Christ as their personal savior in his Los Angeles crusade of 1949.",

As a best selling author and a celebrity debater, he has managed to parlay his attacks on Christianity into a very lucrative business.  He is not only anxious to share his disdain for God, but he also finds great joy and satisfaction in attacking his Christian opponents on the stage.  But even with all the fame and success, Sol is empty and distraught on the inside and his increasing reliance on alcohol to numb the pain is only making things worse.\n\nHis New York party lifestyle has isolated him from his ex wife Katy and their two remaining sons.  Their unrelenting faith in God is something that Sol has actually grown to resent and he tells Katy that he just got sick and tired of her praying for his soul.\n\nSol\u2019s self-destructive habits eventually catch up to him and a serious car crash leaves him clinically dead for four minutes before he is finally resuscitated by some heroic first responders.  It\u2019s a miracle that he\u2019s still alive, but what really changes Sol\u2019s outlook on life is what happens during those four minutes.  It\u2019s a four word message that refuses to let him go despite his best efforts to deny it.\n\nWith the support of Katy\u2019s unwavering love and faith, and his own questions about what he may or may not have actually experienced, Sol struggles to find meaning and purpose in the words LET THERE BE LIGHT.",

Luke acts as a \u2018narrator\u2019 of events rather than the conventional author, painting a picture of Jesus as a very human character, full of compassion for all the suffering in the world. Luke sees Jesus as the \u2018Saviour\u2019 of all people irrespective of their beliefs, always on the side of the needy and the deprived against the rich and the powerful. He constantly challenges those in power for their self righteousness. This full-length feature film about the life of Jesus takes the actual Gospel text as its script, word for word, unedited. Five years in the making, this epic production has been critically acclaimed by leading religious scholars as a unique and highly authentic telling of the Jesus story. Narrated in the NIV by leading British actor Richard E. Grant (\u2018Downton Abbey\u2019, \u2018Gosford Park\u2019) and the KJV by Sir Derek Jacobi (\u2018Gladiator\u2019, \u2018The Kings Speech\u2019, \u2018I, Claudius\u2019) it is based on the latest theological, historical and archaeological research. With specially constructed sets and the extraordinarily authentic villages and countryside of rural Morocco, it immerses the viewer in the world of first century Palestine.",

The story begins with His birth and illustrates how His teachings attracted not only His disciples, but crowds of believers. When the Pharisees, chief priests and elders learn of Jesus, they conspire to have Him arrested, beaten, tried and crucified on the cross. This classic film is a beautiful interpretation of the greatest story ever told.",

After his wife and child are killed, Marcus abandons his trade as blacksmith to gain fame and fortune through the only way open to him. Through his spectacular, merciless prowess in the arena, he rises to the top of his profession and travels throughout the empire. While in Jerusalem, he befriends Pontius Pilate, witnesses a subversive young rabbi's march to Calvary and adopts a young orphan, Flavius. But Marcus remains unmoved as the cult of the crucified rabbi spreads through the empire--until Flavius is sent to die in the arena as a Christian. Now, in Marcus' last act of bravery, he frees his son and undergoes a spiritual awakening just as one of the most destructive volcanic eruptions in recorded history destroys his Roman city",

                "description": "The Prayer Box is a beautifully tragic story about what happens when God doesn't intervene the way people want him to. Following the story of a young boy who sets off on a mission to get God's attention in hopes that God will heal his sister from terminal cancer, the young boy begins answering the prayers left by church members in the pastor's prayer box after the pastor throws them away, jaded by his own suffering. It tackles the heavy issues of unanswered prayer and if God even hears/answers prayer with a message that is heartbreaking in its raw portrayal of human pain and suffering in this world. Not a conventional inspirational faith film, this film is undeniably powerful in the fact that it challenges preconceived notions of whitewashed happy-go-lucky faith. This film does not hide the fact that life is full of pain, suffering, loss, and betrayal, yet it somehow manages to take these themes and find God in the midst of it all. There is a childlike innocence and naivety to the young boy who finds a confidant in an elderly man who takes him under wing, providing both mentorship and comic relief amid the pain the young boy faces with his dying sister and his mother who has distanced herself from the rest of the world. The most interesting character, however, is that of the Pastor who shocks the audience with his dumping of the prayer requests into the trashcan. Initially painted as a hypocritical and unfeeling spiritual leader to a group of blind followers, his character evolves into one of particular interest as it is revealed how he became so jaded at his calling, and how the young boy\u2019s faith brings a personal revival to the Pastor's life and his congregation as a whole. This is a phenomenally complex, challenging, and thought-provoking film, powerfully presented with an expertly delicate hand.",

Abruptly uprooted from his pampered lifestyle in sunny California, Buck finds himself in the exotic wilds of the Alaskan Yukon. As the newest dog on a mail delivery sled team during the turbulent Gold Rush days of the 1890s, Buck has left behind a once comfortable life for one of hardship and survival. Life again changes dramatically for Buck when he meets Thornton, a loner-turned-adventurer, and it's clear that the two are destined to experience the adventure of a lifetime. Navigating through an environment that is as unforgiving as it is spectacular, the journey profoundly transforms both man and dog. With its unique blend of intense live action and cutting-edge animation, The Call Of The Wild is a visually stunning experience featuring realistic, emotionally authentic characters.",

One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in 1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite a preponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony against him came from a criminal with a motive to lie. In the years that follow, Bryan becomes embroiled in a labyrinth of legal and political maneuverings and overt and unabashed racism as he fights for Walter, and others like him, with the odds\u2014and the system\u2014stacked against them.",

The wondrous news spreads rapidly throughout France, leaving in its wake a variety of consequences: adoration, suspicion and greed among the people of Lourdes skepticism from the town doctor (Lee J. Cobb) charges of insanity from the town prosecutor (Vincent Price) threats of physical punishment, then support and guidance from the Dean of Lourdes (Charles Bickford), who finally becomes convinced that the miracle has, indeed, taken place. Winner of four Academy Awards, including Best Actress and Best Score, this true story is both first-rate filmmaking and an inspiring tribute to faith, courage and the human spirit.",

Scott (Davidson) has been a case of arrested development ever since his firefighter father died when he was seven. He's now reached his mid-20s having achieved little, chasing a dream of becoming a tattoo artist that seems far out of reach. As his ambitious younger sister (Maude Apatow, HBO's Euphoria) heads off to college, Scott is still living with his exhausted ER nurse mother (Oscar\u00ae-winner Marisa Tomei) and spends his days smoking weed, hanging with his buddies and secretly hooking up with his childhood friend Kelsey. When his mother starts dating a loudmouth firefighter, it sets off a chain of events that will force Scott to grapple with his grief and take his first tentative steps toward moving forward in life.",
