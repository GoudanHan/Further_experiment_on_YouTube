Consumers are relying on grocery delivery at an unprecedented rate due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and some analysts believe customers will continue to shop online even as things go back to normal. \n\n\u201cToday, we welcomed Walmart to the Instacart marketplace for the first time in the U.S. Instacart now delivers from Walmart locations in three California markets \u2014 Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego \u2014 as well as Tulsa, Oklahoma,\u201d an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe new partnership brings thousands of items \u2014 from groceries, alcohol and pantry staples to home decor and improvement, personal care, electronics and more \u2014 at everyday low prices from Walmart stores to customers\u2019 doors in as fast as an hour.\u201d\n\nInstacart already partners with or delivers goods from Aldi, Target, Costco, Albertsons, Kroger and Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club, along with smaller grocers and drug stores.\n\nBy offering quick delivery, big chain grocers have a stronger position against Amazon, which offers grocery delivery services Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime Now from its own warehouses and Whole Foods stores. \n\nIn his testimony before the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust on July 29, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said companies such as Shopify and Instacart are emerging as competitors to Amazon\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, curbside pickup of online orders has increased over 200%, in part due to COVID-19 concerns,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cWe also face new competition from the likes of Shopify and Instacart \u2014 companies that enable traditionally physical stores to put up a full online store almost instantaneously and to deliver products directly to customers in new and innovative ways \u2014 and a growing list of omnichannel business models.\u201d\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

The Humvee was originally designed to ferry troops around the battlefield in Europe against the Soviet Union. But during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Humvee was pushed to the sidelines in favor of vehicles that could better survive roadside bombs.\n\nThe Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, or JLTV, has now taken on the mantle of being the new frontline tactical vehicle favored by the U.S. military. \n\n\u201cThe JLTV family of vehicles was designed to restore payload and performance capabilities that were traded from previous light tactical vehicles for added protection in recent conflicts \u2014 giving commanders an improved protected mobility solution and the first vehicle purpose-built for modern battlefield networks,\u201d Michael Sprang, the program manager for the JLTV program at the U.S. Army, wrote in an email to CNBC.\n\nThe vehicle is manufactured by Oshkosh Defense.\n\n\u201cThe JLTV combines the protection of the MRAP, which was so critical in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the agility of a Humvee,\u201d Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ve driven it. With the suspension system, you could be drinking a cup of coffee, going over massive bumps and not spill. It\u2019s a critical modernization priority both for the Army and the Marine Corps.\u201d\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",
