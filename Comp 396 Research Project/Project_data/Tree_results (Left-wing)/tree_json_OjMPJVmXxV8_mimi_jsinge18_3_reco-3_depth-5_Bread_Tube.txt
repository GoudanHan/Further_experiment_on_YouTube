The decision was taken by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh in view of surge in positivity rate in the state. India's top doctor and AIIMS director Randeep Guleria has said that it is not possible to predict a third covid but warned that if it hits the country, the kids are at the risk of infection because they are not vaccinated yet.  Meanwhile, Karnataka has decided to reopen schools from class 9 to 12 after consulting experts. Russia has recorded record covid deaths as delta variant surges infections and fatalities in the country.",

Aimed at recapturing a pre-smart phone era when dancefloors were about connection with the music and those around you (rather than your online social networks), the events recently launched with a special sold out party at San Francisco s Mezzanine and the label follows here with an emotional 4/4 gem from Lane 8 himself in Fingerprint .\n\nLooking to the the classy, emotional and melodic house sound that has seen Lane 8 secure multiple Hype Machine #1, label debut Fingerprint is a bold step forward from the excellent release history that Lane 8 has established on buzz labels such as Anjunadeep and Suara. \n\nAlready going down as a highlight at the first This Never Happened event at Mezzanine in San Francisco, Fingerprint marries a timeless, melodic simplicity with a forward-thinking club groove; all executed in Daniel's unique style.\n\nFollow Lane 8:\nWebsite: ",
