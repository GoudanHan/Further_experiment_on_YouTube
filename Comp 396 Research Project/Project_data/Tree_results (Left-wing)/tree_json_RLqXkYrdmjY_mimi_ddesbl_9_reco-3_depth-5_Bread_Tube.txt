I know a lot of people are still stuck inside at the moment due to covid, so I wanted to create an ambience to transport you to a fancy restaurant in New York.\n\nEnjoy this 3 hours calming restaurant ambience, which includes soft Jazz music, relaxing rain sounds and very light restaurant chatter. The couple dining are enjoying dessert / coffee, while rain hammers on the window against the bustling city backdrop. \n\nHope you enjoy :)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f How i made this video \ud83c\udfa4\n\nFor this video I commissioned a talented 3D designer, to bring my restaurant design to life. I then used adobe premiere pro and after effects to create the animations.\n\nWith the exception of the Jazz music (see below) and the intro quotes, all audio is original recording using the Sony PCM-D100 microphone.\n\nEquipment / software i use\n* Mic - Sony PCM-D100 Mobile DSD/LPCM Recorder\n* Adobe Premiere pro\n* Adobe after Effects \n\n\u00a9\ufe0f Re-use of this video / audio is not permitted\n\n \ud83c\udfb5Jazz Music\ud83c\udfb5\n\nThe list of Jazz songs used in this video is provided below :) I have a licence to use all Jazz songs with a subscription to Epidemic Sound.\n\n* \u2018Almost Summer\u2019 by Franz Gordon \n* \u2018Some who cares\u2019 by Franz Gordon\n* \u2018Seeing you again\u2019 by Almost here\n* \u2018Meline\u2019 by Cornelio\n* \u2018Gone to soon\u2019 by Bladverk Band\n* \u2018I won\u2019t give you up\u2019 by Almost here\n* \u2018Here and now\u2019 by Bladverk Band\n* \u2018Midnight Serenade\u2019 by Bladverk Band\n* \u2018What a little smile can do\u2019 by Oakwood Station\n* \u2018Seven Falls\u2019 by Hara Noda\n* \u2018Swimmer\u2019 by Hara Noda\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
