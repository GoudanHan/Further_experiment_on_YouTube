The Humvee was originally designed to ferry troops around the battlefield in Europe against the Soviet Union. But during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Humvee was pushed to the sidelines in favor of vehicles that could better survive roadside bombs.\n\nThe Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, or JLTV, has now taken on the mantle of being the new frontline tactical vehicle favored by the U.S. military. \n\n\u201cThe JLTV family of vehicles was designed to restore payload and performance capabilities that were traded from previous light tactical vehicles for added protection in recent conflicts \u2014 giving commanders an improved protected mobility solution and the first vehicle purpose-built for modern battlefield networks,\u201d Michael Sprang, the program manager for the JLTV program at the U.S. Army, wrote in an email to CNBC.\n\nThe vehicle is manufactured by Oshkosh Defense.\n\n\u201cThe JLTV combines the protection of the MRAP, which was so critical in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the agility of a Humvee,\u201d Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ve driven it. With the suspension system, you could be drinking a cup of coffee, going over massive bumps and not spill. It\u2019s a critical modernization priority both for the Army and the Marine Corps.\u201d\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",
