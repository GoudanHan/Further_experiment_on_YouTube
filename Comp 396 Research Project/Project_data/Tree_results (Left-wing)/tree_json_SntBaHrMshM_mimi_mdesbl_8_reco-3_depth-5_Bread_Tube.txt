Let the whole world experience swimming with wild dolphins anytime and anywhere through virtual reality. So we helped them to create some stunning footage of wild dolphins. The mission of The Dolphin Swim Club is to film the most beautiful 360 video footage ever made of wild dolphins. Through Virtual reality, this footage will be accessable by anyone on the planet. Whether it\u2019s for fun, but also for healthcare purposes by treating anxiety disorders for example. We worked on the production of the 360\u00b0 videos, a brand new website and several promotional videos.\n\nAfter almost a year of preperation and research, lots of brainstorm sessions and overcoming various obstacles, we did it. We filmed more than 80 wild spinner, and bottlenose dolphins each day for a whole week. Location: the Red Sea in Egypt.\n\nThe only way to pull this of was getting the best experts together on one boat. A dedicated team that has a profounding love for dolphins and understands the risks and rules that come to play at a shoot like this. From the cook and shipper to the divers, cameracrew and researchers. This was the right crew for the right job. In order to get the most out of 6 days of filming, good logistics where crucial on a production like this. Therefor the production crew was devided in to two teams. While one team was in the water filming, the team on the boat focussed on backing up the footage from an earlier run on two hard drives.\n\nAfter 7 days of filming, salty camera\u2019s and terabytes of data it was time to head home. But here, a new phase would start; post-production on 75 takes and creating a marketing strategy for getting this footage out in the world. After we made selections of the best footage we started working out a plan where this footage was going to be used for. After all; post-producing a clip for a TV commercial needs a totally different approach than a clip that is used for anxiety disorder treatment\u2026 We spend more than a month on stitching, color grading, sound design and editing the footage in 4K resolution.\n\nCheckout the making-of: ",

                        "description": "Wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin sets off on a worldwide journey of discovery to find out why animals of different species make friends with each other, and even fall in love.\nWildlife biologist Liz Bonnin goes on a journey of discovery to find out the science behind unusual interactions in the animal kingdom. Some of the surprising associations include a polar bear befriending huskies, a cat mothering ducklings, and an orangutan who keeps a pet dog. These odd pairings are not just limited to different species; animal relationships with humans are also explored, as people have been known to keep exotic pets such as lions, hippos and buffalos. Bonnin investigates the root of the affectionate connections and tries to uncover the reasons for the behaviours. \nSome people have sought out unusual, and even potentially dangerous relationships, with some very surprising animals.\"\n\nContent licensed by: DRG\n\nAny queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com",

Nothing short of a heartbreaking disaster for the Afghans. \n\n\"The Taliban has moved in and is running rampant across the country, seizing cities, there's bloodshed, and it's imposing Sharia Law on families. \n\n\u201cThe United States is nowhere to be seen.

Inspired by her experience, she returned to the U.S. to explore what yoga means to the West and how it can transform lives. What she found was something wonderful: a path that can enable anyone to transform suffering in order to experience daily peace and happiness.",

Unfortunately, she wants to move the franchise to Miami, and a losing season is her only ticket to Florida. So she signs the wildest gang of screwballs that ever spit tobacco. They're handsome, but they're hopeless! Her catcher (Tom Berenger) is a washed-up womanizer who struck out in life. Her ace pitcher (Charlie Sheen) is a punked-out crazy who struck out with the law. And her third baseman (L.A. Law's Corbin Bernsen) is more concerned fielding endorsements than grounders. Throw in a busload of other misfits and you've got yourself a hilarious line-up that's destined for disaster! Or is it?",

Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive. The Island also stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.",

When she's accused of being a \"woman who hates women,\" she puts affirmative action on the to-do list, and...presto. Molly is hired as the one woman in Katherine's all-male writers' room. But Molly might be too little too late, as the formidable Katherine also faces the reality of low ratings and a network that wants to replace her. Molly, wanting to prove she's not simply a diversity hire who's disrupting the comfort of the brotherhood, is determined to help Katherine by revitalizing her show and career - and possible effect even bigger change at the same time.",

Pixar Animation Studios' all-new feature film SOUL introduces Joe Gardner (voice of Jamie Foxx) \u2013 a middle-school band teacher who gets the chance of a lifetime to play at the best jazz club in town. But one small misstep takes him from the streets of New York City to The Great Before \u2013 a fantastical place where new souls get their personalities, quirks and interests before they go to Earth. Determined to return to his life, Joe teams up with a precocious soul, 22 (voice of Tina Fey), who has never understood the appeal of the human experience. As Joe desperately tries to show 22 what's great about living, he may just discover the answers to some of life's most important questions. Directed by Academy Award\u00ae winner Pete Docter (\"Inside Out,\" \"Up\"), co-directed by Kemp Powers (\"One Night in Miami\"), written by Kemp Powers & Mike Jones, and produced by Academy Award nominee Dana Murray (Pixar short \"Lou\"), SOUL also stars the voice talents of Phylicia Rashad, Questlove and Daveed Diggs. It features original jazz music by globally renowned musician Jon Batiste, and Oscar\u00ae winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (\"The Social Network\"), from Nine Inch Nails, composed an original score that drifts between the real and soul worlds.",

Set during the 1970s punk rock revolution in London, the story follows a clever and creative young grifter named Estella, who is determined to become a successful designer. After Estella befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, the three build a life for themselves on the London streets. Before long, Estella's flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute fashion legend, played by Emma Thompson (HOWARDS END, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent \"Cruella.\" CRUELLA is directed by Craig Gillespie (I, TONYA) from a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, story by Aline Brosh McKenna and Kelly Marcel & Steve Zissis. It was produced by Andrew Gunn (FREAKY FRIDAY), Marc Platt (MARY POPPINS RETURNS) and Kristin Burr (CHRISTOPHER ROBIN), with Emma Stone, Michelle Wright, Jared LeBoff and Glenn Close serving as executive producers. Spectacular costume designer Jenny Beavan (MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, A ROOM WITH A VIEW) creates the dazzling and imaginative costumes, which take on a life of their own. WARNING: Some flashing lights scenes in this film may affect photosensitive viewers.",

                    "description": "Entrepreneur and Speaker Rahim Fazal considers it a person's duty to always stretch personal limits and therefore grow as a human being. Certainly he has put that belief into practice throughout most of his life. At a young age, he is already a successful businessman, an MBA graduate, and a frequent and popular speaker. Passionately willing to take calculated and essential risks in order to achieve his visions, Rahim quietly created an online business while still in high school, negotiated its sale during his Senior year, and then spent two years building a second company and ultimately taking it public. Most recently, Rahim completed his MBA at Canada's top management school, the Richard Ivey School of Business. Because of his achievements, he was the youngest student in the school's 80 year history accepted without a prerequisite university degree. Rahim is a frequent and popular speaker to high school and college students across the US and Canada. He is also an advisor to the Extreme Entrepreneurship Education Corporation in New York City, an organization helping young people realize the value of pursuing entrepreneurship through education and outreach.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

                    "description": "With comedy, you not only laugh but you also gain understanding in a unique way. Comedy has a setup and then a punch line. The setup moves the audience in one direction-toward what is expected. The punch line occurs when you change direction and take the audience to the unexpected. This same process can be applied to life. Comedian Michael Jr. shows how to take your life's setups and then change direction in a way that brings fulfillment, revelation, and joy not only to you but also to those around you.\n\nOnce in a generation, a comedian comes along who speaks to everyone. Today, that comedian is known simply as Michael Jr.\n\nWatch him onstage and you\u2019ll see a man at ease\u2026with himself, his audience, and his message. Listen to his voice and you\u2019ll detect a comfortable, conversational style that hides a sly sense of mischief. Hear his words and you\u2019ll laugh at the universal themes that connect us all.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

He approaches medicine and human caring in ways that emphasise the innate healing capacity in people, the factors that modify the healing response, and their interaction in the therapeutic encounter and relationship \u2013 ideas adopted as the core of The Fifth Wave document exploring future health in Scotland. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

By seeking out rejection for 100 days -- from asking a stranger to borrow $100 to requesting a \"burger refill\" at a restaurant -- Jiang desensitized himself to the pain and shame that rejection often brings and, in the process, discovered that simply asking for what you want can open up possibilities where you expect to find dead ends.\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

Just as the world becomes a smaller place with increase in communication and transport technology, so the universe becomes a smaller place with the increase in meditation technology!  \n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.

He discovered how horses can help identify someone or resonance with his or her destination.\nIn 2005 he started the Wind Training Systemic Horse Coaching; a training for professionals who want to integrate the systemic work into depth in their current practice. He is currently focusing on the development of full-width systemic thinking in various areas in the Netherlands, Belgium and Brazil. The first international systemic training with horses will soon start. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

And yet, we are wiping out the very animals we should celebrate; we are the flood coming for Noah's Ark. Carl leaves us with a difficult question: Do we have what it takes to let life on earth survive?\n\nCarl Safina\u2019s work has been recognized with MacArthur, Pew, and Guggenheim Fellowships, and his writing has won the Lannan Literary Award and the John Burroughs, James Beard, and George Rabb medals. He has a PhD in ecology from Rutgers University. Safina is the inaugural endowed professor for nature and humanity at Stony Brook University, where he co-chairs the steering committee of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and is founding president of the not-for-profit Safina Center. He hosted the 10-part PBS series Saving the Ocean with Carl Safina. His writing appears in The New York Times, National Geographic, Audubon and other periodicals, and on the Web at National Geographic News and Views, Huffington Post, and CNN.com. Carl Safina\u2019s writing shows how humanity is changing the natural world and what those changes mean for wildlife and for people.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
