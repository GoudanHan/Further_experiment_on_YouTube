Monterey would launch the careers of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Otis Redding, but they were just a few among a wildly diverse cast that included Simon and Garfunkel, the Mamas and the Papas, the Who, the Byrds, Hugh Masekela, and the extraordinary Ravi Shankar. With his characteristic v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style, D. A. Pennebaker captured it all, immortalizing moments that have become legend: Pete Townshend destroying his guitar, Jimi Hendrix burning his. The Criterion Collection is proud to present this timeless document of a landmark event.",

Click here for a FREE download to help Increase your Focus!:\nhttp://bit.ly/2IGZAZZ \n\nOur habits and rituals make up our lives.\n\nEvery day we need physical energy, mental clarity, and emotional balance to tackle everything that comes our way. Self-care, i.e. rituals, is one of the secrets to performing at our highest level.\n\nI find that having daily rituals helps me stay on course. These daily rituals help me stay focused and moving forward even in the darkest of times.\n\nIn any situation and at any given moment, we have a choice to respond or to react. We can choose to seek the light and redirect our paths when we find ourselves in darkness. It\u2019s an inside job \u2014 choosing how we respond. That\u2019s where rituals can help.\n\nHere are six rituals that I do every day. They help me stay focused on what\u2019s important and help to keep me balanced.\n\nI drink a glass of water upon awakening (usually lemon water). Why? Because our bodies lose water overnight, so I am dehydrated. Many people don\u2019t drink enough water. You will be surprised at how this helps start your day fresh. I also repeat affirmations upon awakening.\n\nGratitude \u2013 Every morning I write 10 things that I am grateful for. I then meditate for five minutes, asking for guidance for the day. That is followed by sending love to three people who irritate me. You will be amazed how great you will feel when you do this exercise. It is a beautiful way to start your day. Also, whenever I am stressed during the day I pull out my gratitude journal and read it. That puts me back on track.\n\nReading \u2013 Every morning I will read for 15 \u2013 30 minutes. My reading usually consists of something by Wallace Wattles, Napoleon Hill, Dr. Joseph Murphy, or of course my mentor Bob Proctor. This, combined with #2 above sets the tone for my day. Regardless of what is happening, I do not allow external circumstances to control how I feel. Find something that inspires you and read it daily.\n\nExercise \u2013 Everyone needs to move their body! It doesn\u2019t have to be hours in the gym. You can dance in your living room, you can walk around the block, you can do whatever you want \u2013 just move. Regular movement keeps us healthy and alert. It boosts energy and mood and relieves stress.\n\nMy Top Six \u2013 These have been set the night before, but I review them in the morning. Set Six Goal Achieving Activities that you will complete the next day. Prioritize them, then take action and do them. Some days you may not complete all six, just move the one or two that you didn\u2019t complete over to the next day. Always have six. If you have moved a couple over from the day before then add four, don\u2019t go over six. Aim to complete all of them. This will keep you focused and moving toward your goal. In other words, always take ACTION.\n\nReflect \u2013 To bring positive closure to the day I reflect for 10 minutes. I ask myself, \u201cWhat went well?\u201d, \u201cWhere can I improve?\u201d. If something happened that was less than great, I look at it as an opportunity to learn and move on. \n\nFinally, I repeat affirmations just before going to bed. This fills my mind with constructive thoughts of harmony, health, peace, joy, and abundance.\n\nSo, what are your daily rituals?\n\nDo you have any?\n\nHaving rituals will go a long way in developing a healthy mind, body, and spirit.\n\n**For more visit our website: ",

If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone \u2013 but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, you're mistaken. As the director of 75-year-old study on adult development, Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction. In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long life.\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

Because anything you want will come to you when you get in harmony with it.\n\nThe Law of Attraction has gotten plenty of attention over the past 15 years because of\nThe Secret. However, you can\u2019t apply this law successfully and consistently without first understanding frequencies and vibration.\n\nBob Proctor has been studying and teaching universal laws for more than 50 years. No one better understands that the Law of Attraction works by the totality of the vibration you send out, not merely by what you want. That\u2019s why Bob was asked to be one of the prominent teachers in The Secret.\n\n5 Days to Understanding Frequencies, Vibration, and the Law of Attraction With Bob Proctor\nAug 16th - 20th streaming LIVE right here on our YouTube Channel! \n\nYou can enjoy this LIVE training here but we want to encourage you to register for the training at the link below so that you can receive the added benefits of our daily assignments, downloads, a personally assigned PGI Staff Success Advisor, community conversation and more:\nhttps://www.proctorgallagherinstitute...\n\n#BobProctor #LawOfAttraction",
