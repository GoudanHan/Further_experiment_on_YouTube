At the height of unprecedented success, Ronstadt, a restless and adventurous artist, turned away from pop music to explore an astonishing variety of musical styles, from American standards to country to classical operetta before circling back to her family roots with traditional Mexican canciones. Withstanding constant pressure from a risk-averse industry, Linda insisted on following her musical instincts. \nToday Ronstadt has Parkinson\u2019s disease and her magnificent singing voice has been silenced. But rather than letting that voice be lost to history, Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice tells Linda\u2019s story through her own words and music, and by such professional colleagues as Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, and Aaron Neville, among many others.",

                    "description": "Make America Laugh Again is a poignant political comedy about being brown and an immigrant in Trump's America, seen through the eyes of comedians of Middle Eastern origin. Shortly after becoming president, Donald Trump imposed a \"travel ban\" on people from predominantly Muslim countries causing mass protests across the country and a fierce legal battle with civil rights groups. Aron Kader, a Palestinian-American comedian wanted to respond to Trump's ban in the only way he knew: a comedy show featuring brown comedians. The Show takes place at HaHa Club in North Hollywood and plays to a packed house. During the pre-show, comedians get together and discuss the political climate in the country and in the end most agree that laughter is the best response.",
