                    "description": "#Taliban #Afghanistan #RepublicTV\n\nOn the occasion of Afghanistan's Independence Day on August 19, scores of citizens of the war-ravaged State took to streets marching with a 100-metre long national flag protesting against the Taliban takeover. Marking the protest against the self-imposed rule of the hardline Islamist group, Afghans seem to strive for independence, sovereignty and freedom in its true sense. \n\nIn a hugely symbolic protest against the Taliban, women, men and children audaciously marched on the streets bearing a 100m-long flag of Afghanistan - an act of stupendous bravery given the intolerance associated with Taliban. The daring and tenacious act draws a sharp contrast with the escapist deeds of those like their President Ashraf Ghani, who fled to another country on August 15 as the citizens likely watched on horrified by the utter capitulation of the 350,000-strong army he had commanded with US support.\n\nWomen and children gathered on the main roads of Kabul and have been chanting 'Long Live Afghanistan' and 'National Flag Is Our Identity'. These sentiments come to the fore after the Taliban officially declared Afghanistan as an 'Islamic Emirate' on the country's 102nd Independence Day.\n\nIn the recent turn of events, instead of fleeing and evacuating their native land, hundreds of women and children came forward to fight for their basic and moral rights. Women and childrens' defiance against the Taliban in Kabul comes on its streets after the Taliban's covering ads, billboards with women sporting Western clothes in black paint, while men in jeans and T-shirts rushed to change into traditional tunics. The roadshow protest with Afghanistan's flag highlights the dire need and hunger in people to fight against the hardline Taliban and fight for aspects the country reformed in the past 20 years. \n\nRepublic Bangla is now LIVE \u25ba ",
