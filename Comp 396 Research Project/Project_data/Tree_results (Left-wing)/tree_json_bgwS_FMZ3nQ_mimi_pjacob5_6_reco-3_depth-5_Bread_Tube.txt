With light vim and pure talent, he demonstrates his unique playing style, which is notably a development of the Travis picking technique and blending of rhythm and melody. \n\nIn his career, he's played on recordings for Air Supply and Men at Work and in his twenties he joined one of Australia's biggest rock acts, Dragon. Now, as a two-time Grammy nominee with a career spanning five decades, he has, for several years, performed over 300 concerts annually. He's worked with Martin Taylor on a jazz-inspired duet album The Colonel and the Governor. His most recent original material is Little By Little (2011).\n\nConnect with Tommy:\nTw: ",

In this TEDx talk, he argues that others diagnosed with ADHD should utilize their \u201csuperpower\u201d as an advantageous characteristic at work and in everyday life. George Cicci took his late-in-life ADHD diagnosis as both an answer to his questions about his personal behavior and difficulties, and as an opportunity to hit the \"restart\" button on his life and make up for lost time. Since his diagnosis thirteen years ago, he has become obsessed with learning to hack \u201cThe Superpower\u201d as he calls it and teaches others to do the same. He is currently exercising this superpower as the Chief Marketing Officer at Impakt Media, where he works with brands like NBC Sports, Lucas Oil Pro Motocross and Major League Baseball affiliates. In addition to this, he is finishing his book \u201cADHD Life Hacker: the Four Rules for Success\u201d and is launching an online course in productivity for people with ADHD. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

But in a culture where norms are being blown to bits and everyday life is a provocation, what\u2019s a comic to do? This thoughtful and honest talk by writer, actor, and comedian Andrew Schulz reveals the challenges of getting an audience to laugh at a time when not much shocks anyone anymore.\n\nTEDxColumbusCircle (",

Some define him as an expert institutional investor, while others know him as a large scale installation artist, avid outdoorsman, professor, decision strategist, coach, business leader, mindfulness extremist, author, speaker, daredevil or Guinness world record holder. In his talk, Stephen explains that what truly defines him aren't titles, but an approach to decision making that transformed him from someone who struggled with simple tasks to a guy who is continuously achieving even his most ambitious dreams.\n\nFor thirty years, he has applied cognitive science to investing, business and life. The result has been the turnaround of numerous institutional businesses, career best returns for managers who have adopted his methods, the development of a $1.25 billion dollar hedge fund and a rapidly shrinking bucket list.\nMr. Duneier teaches graduate courses on Decision Analysis in UCSB\u2019s College of Engineering. His book, AlphaBrain is due for release in early 2017 from Wiley & Sons.\nThrough Bija Advisors, he helps business leaders improve performance by applying proven, proprietary decision-making methods to their own processes.\nHis artwork has been featured around the world and is represented by the Sullivan Goss Gallery. As Commissioner of the League of Professional Educators, Duneier is using cognitive science to alter the landscape of American education. He is the former Head of Currency Option Trading at Bank of America and Emerging Markets at AIG International.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                    "description": "Understanding why you feel what you feel is one of the most important aspects of human development. After understanding comes control. When you control your emotions through vertical development, you can be more successful and happy.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen adults behave like children and \u2018throw their toys out of the pram\u2019 if they don\u2019t get their way. An inability to control emotions prevents us from growing up and becoming mature successful human beings. \n\nDr. Alan Watkins, founder of Complete Coherence, introduces the key phases of human development and explains why poor emotional control is holding back progress. He asks us to imagine a world where we never have to feel anything we don\u2019t want to feel; where we have complete control of what we feel and when we feel it.\n\nEmotions meet technology in a new app (Universe of Emotions). Taking us on a journey around this Universe, Dr Watkins explains how we can choose our own emotional \u2018planetary\u2019 address and live happier and more fulfilled lives.\n\nAlan Watkins is CEO and founder of leadership consultancy, Complete Coherence. He is recognized as an international expert on leadership and human performance. \n\nDr Watkins has a broad mix of commercial, academic, scientific and technological abilities. Over the past 18 years he has been a coach to many of Europe\u2019s top business leaders and has helped companies treble share price, enter the FTSE 100, salvage difficult turnarounds and establish market leadership in their industry. He has written five books and numerous peer reviewed scientific articles. He advised the GB Olympic squad prior to London 2012 and is working with them leading up to Rio in 2016. He has three degrees and is a neuroscientist by background.\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

If we have a bad day at work we are likely to take that negativity home with us and vice versa. It is of paramount importance that we create healthy environments in the spaces that most affect our lives by giving of our best and receiving the like in return. The 5 Chairs is a powerful and systematic method which helps us master our own behaviours and manage the behaviours of others. To be a good leader is to contribute to the success and happiness of everyone, at work and at home, on a conscious level. The 5 Chairs offer 5 Choices. Which will you choose?\n\nBehavioral Coach, Corporate Trainer, Author of \u20185 Chairs 5 Choices\u2019. Louise Evans heads up her own organization in Florence, Italy from which she offers international leadership development, cross-cultural transitional coaching and personal development programmes for individuals and teams working in international contexts. She is English but has lived and worked in Germany, France and for the last 30 years in Italy. \nThree things have always been important in her life - people, travel and the performing arts - all three of which she combines in her daily work. Having travelled to seven-five countries and experienced culture shock three times, Louise brings multiple perspectives to the present moment to help people connect across their differences. Louise believes deeply in people\u2019s ability to grow and transform. What she values most is helping people strengthen their self-awareness and their understanding of others so that they bring their best selves into the world in every situation.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Procrastination is not a matter of mere \u201claziness\u201d and the solution is not simply \u201cbetter time management\u201d. Could it be that procrastination is actually a highly effective strategy for self-protection and that\u2019s why we continue to do it? In this talk, Nic unravels the surprising and perplexing motivational dynamics underlying our procrastination that lead so often to disengagement and burnout. Illustrated with examples drawn from two decades of coaching students, he introduces self-worth theory of motivation, a powerful research-based conceptual framework for understanding and overcoming procrastination, avoidance, and over-commitment. Dominic (Nic) Voge is Senior Associate Director of Princeton University\u2019s McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning, and author of \u201cLife Beyond Grades\u201d (Cambridge University Press). His work focuses on helping students truly thrive and achieve a sense of well-being not only academically, but in all realms of their lives. Nic is a founding member of The Resilience Consortium, the Princeton Perspective Project, and Principedia, initiatives designed to deepen engagement and learning among students. He maintains private consulting and coaching practices. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.\n\nDaryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley\u2019s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.\n\nIn 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.\n\nSince his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a \u201ccertificate of friendship\u201d from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He\u2019s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly\u2019s granddaughter.\n\nDavis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations. He is also an actor with stage and screen credits, appearing in the critically acclaimed HBO police drama, The Wire, and most recently, as the subject of the documentary Accidental Courtesy, which filmed his real life encounters with Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leaders as he helps to dismantle racism across the United States\n\n Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations.
