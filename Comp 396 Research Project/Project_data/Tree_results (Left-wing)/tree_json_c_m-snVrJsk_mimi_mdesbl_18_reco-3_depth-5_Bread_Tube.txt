Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss. Hosted in the St. Regis Hotel Ballroom, Aspen, Colorado.",

Get your copy here: http://thebeatles1.lnk.to/DeluxeBluRay\n\"In We Can Work It Out, Paul did the first half, I did the middle eight. But you've got Paul writing, 'We can work it out, we can work it out' - real optimistic, y'know, and me impatient, 'Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend'.\" (John Lennon)\n'We Can Work It Out' became The Beatles' sixth single in a row to top the US charts. At the time, no other band had achieved such success. The track took over 11 hours to perfect - up to this point, that was the longest period The Beatles had spent in the studio on a single song. \nAt Twickenham Film Studios, a little over three weeks after the single was recorded, The Beatles made three separate promo films for 'We Can Work It Out'. Like all the other films shot that day, the medium was two-inch black and white videotape, a relatively new format for the time. Many TV stations, however, weren't set up for videotape, so 16mm copies were made for distribution worldwide.\nYou can find out more and pre-order at ",

Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nWritten by John as an expression of his love for Yoko Ono, the song is heartfelt and passionate. As John told Rolling Stone magazine in 1970, \u201cWhen it gets down to it, when you\u2019re drowning, you don\u2019t say, \u2018I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me,\u2019 you just scream.\u201d\n\nDuring filming on the roof of Apple, two days after the recording of the track, the band played \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 right after doing two versions of 'Get Back\u2019 and it led straight into 'I\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u2019. Michael Lindsay-Hogg was once again directing a Beatles\u2019 shoot. He and Paul met regularly at the tail end of 1968, while Hogg was directing The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, to discuss the filming of The Beatles\u2019 session in January. By the time that fateful Thursday came around, the penultimate day of January would be the last time The Beatles ever played together in front of any kind of audience.\n\nThis is not the version of \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 heard on the single but the version from the Let It Be\u2026 Naked album \u2013 a composite of both versions that were performed on the roof of Apple in Savile Row\n\nOfficial site: ",

In his career, Andrew has made numerous important contributions to the fields of brain development, brain plasticity, and neural regeneration, and repair.\n\nHe\u2019s received numerous awards and recognitions for his research and publications, including the McKnight Foundation Neuroscience Scholar Award, the Biomedical Scholar Award from the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the Cogan Award for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. \n\nIn addition to being a tenured professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford University, Dr. Andrew is a brilliant neuroscientist and teacher \u2014 he excellently explains complicated concepts in a way that everyday people can understand them and use neuroscience to improve their lives!\n\nAndrew\u2019s goal is to understand how the brain allows us to sense, evaluate, and respond to the world around us. He\u2019s actively working on methods to re-wire and repair eye-to-brain connections for people who suffer from blinding diseases, as well as investigating emotions and how they drive behavior.\n\nWe had a fantastic conversation with a wide range of topics! In fact, I had such a great time talking with Andrew I had to split this interview into two parts! Make sure to tune in this Wednesday to hear the second half of the interview!\n\nIn this first part, we talk about how to handle depression, the positive effects of stress, the science of hope, and so much more! \n\nJoin me on Episode 1,015 to learn how to hack your brain for maximum potential with the incredible Andrew Huberman!",

It\u2019s possible: Research shows that roots have the potential to provide food for the world's population, stop climate change and help extract resources in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nPlants must withstand periods of drought and heat, as well as flooding, and they use their roots to do this. Roots also help them actively search for nutrients in the soil, while warding off dangers such as pathogens and toxins. Now, scientists at the research institute Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich are investigating root growth using high-tech methods. The goal is to breed stress-resistant seeds for plants with robust roots. They are not alone: In Sweden, Professor Linda Maria M\u00e5rtensson is conducting research on a perennial wheat variety that will ensure higher yields while protecting the soil.\n\nAlong the world's coasts, too, roots are a lifesaver. Coastal ecologist Professor Tjeerd Bouma has discovered that if special grasses are planted in front of dikes, they create a salt marsh that acts as a natural breakwater.\n\nMeanwhile, geochemist Dr. Oliver Wiche of the Technical University of Freiberg is researching something known as \"phytomining.\" He wants to know which plants are best suited for mining metals from the soil. Could this root research give rise to a new, environmentally friendly branch of industry?\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He\u2019s now best known \u2013 and loved \u2013 as the BBC\u2019s resident world traveller, a role that\u2019s been recognised with a stint as president of the Royal Geographical Society.\n\nBut the multi-talented star says his favourite thing to do is writing \u2013 whether it\u2019s keeping a diary (his have been published), writing sketches or television scripts, or even writing fiction. His second novel, The Truth, about an ageing, cash-strapped environmental journalist given the chance to profile his hero, was published this year.\n\nThis conversation with Wheeler Centre director Michael Williams covers broad ground: from Palin\u2019s early fascination with trainspotting to the benefit of an attentive sound recordist and what it was like hosting Saturday Night Live with his mum.\n\nOther topics include British comedy in the late 1960s, the process in the writers' room during Monty Python\u2019s formative period, Palin\u2019s particular sensibilities within that group, embarking on Around the World in 80 Days, the development of Life of Brian and an unusual encounter with fan Mayumi Nobetsu (whom he first met whilst filming Full Circle).\n\nHe also talks about his latest travel series Brazil, his new novel The Truth, and the \u2018immense relief\u2019 of the moment when he found his tone as a traveller. And, just for balance, he considers having John Cleese \u2018stuffed, holding a fish, for quite some time\u2019.\n\n\u2014\n\nSupport the Wheeler Centre\nIn an uncertain time for everybody, we're working hard to bring you conversations and ideas through podcasts, live-streams and publishing \u2013 all freely accessible. If you\u2019re in a position to support our efforts to bring you books, writing and ideas from a safe distance, you can make a contribution here: ",

Filmed at Hitchens's home in New York, it was a wide-ranging discussion, with Hitchens characteristically unflinching in his exploration of contemporary controversies, as well as his own illness and death.

His sudden illness was announced shortly afterwards.\n\nChristopher Hitchens is my favorite writer. Recording this video was a great opportunity to meet my hero, who didn't disappoint. His work meant a great deal to me, and losing him was very terrible. I kept this video to myself for ten years to hang onto some piece of him, but I'm now happy to share this recording with everyone.\n\nThe event was held on an unusually humid and hot day, and the inadequate air conditioning and stage lights added to the speaker's discomfort. Hitchens looks like he's baking but everyone in there was moderately uncomfortable. I think he held up well in the spotlight, with the private knowledge that he was facing a serious crisis. The last few minutes are actually my favorite moments, where he warmly greets his book's buyers with kind glances and smiles.  Long Live Christopher Hitchens!",
