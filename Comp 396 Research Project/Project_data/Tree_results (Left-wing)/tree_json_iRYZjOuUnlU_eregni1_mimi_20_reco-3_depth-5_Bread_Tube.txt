What is causing the rise of violence and are our current fears and solutions just making it worse?  My name is Aaron stark. I am 39 years old with 4 children, 2 cats, one dog, and a beautiful wife. I am a stay at home dad; my wife is the breadwinner of the family. I am a comic book fan, a pop culture junkie, and a lover of the sciences. I have more knowledge about superheros, pro wrestling, and comedy than anyone really has a right to. After growing up in very abusive and violent circumstances followed by over a decade if personal recovery, I am now a happy family man. I recently shred a very personal story of my triumph over my past, and it has changed my life forever. My mission is to let people know that no matter how dark it may seem, there is light coming. We really are not alone. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

If the GTI is so good (and it is) why is the iconic sports car recipe always RWD? Is it just because of weight transfer and the traction circle?\n\nJason explores this and more \u2014 and comes to the conclusion that the Mk2 Toyota GR86 is the spiritual successor to the Porsche 944. You'll have to watch to find out how and why.\n\nDon't forget to watch Jason's other episodes on these cars:\n\n2022 Subaru BRZ",
