At 19, she claimed to have invented a miniaturised machine that with a single drop of blood could map a person\u2019s health quickly, reliably and cheaply. She boasted that her technology meant serious diseases like cancer would be prevented before they happened. And it was not only a \u201cwow\u201d moment for patients. High-profile investors rushed to pour a fortune into Holmes\u2019 company, Theranos, and she became Silicon Valley\u2019s first self-made female billionaire. But as Tara Brown reports, her invention was an invention \u2013 it simply didn\u2019t work. Elizabeth Holmes is no visionary. She\u2019s a cruel fraudster who has put people\u2019s lives at risk, and because of that, now faces 20 years in jail.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",
