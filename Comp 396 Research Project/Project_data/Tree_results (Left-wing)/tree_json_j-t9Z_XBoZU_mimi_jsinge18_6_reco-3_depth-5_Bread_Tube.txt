He also told supporters they had made history not just in the province but across Canada for being the first party to defeat an incumbent government in a \"pandemic election.\"\n\nNow-outgoing premier Iain Rankin spoke to his own crowd, starting his own speech even as NDP Leader Gary Burrill was delivering his, and told supporters he would stay on as Liberal leader and push the incoming government on issues that are important to his party and its supporters.\nBurrill, meanwhile, thanked supporters, candidates and campaign staff for their work over the campaign and talked about how he met many engaged Nova Scotians despite the initial thoughts that it would be a \"sleepy election,\" adding that the campaign did not turn out how the party's opponents expected.\n\nAs of posting, the PCs were leading and elected in 31 ridings, the Liberals leading or elected in 17 and the NDP in six, with Independent MLA Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin also having won re-election.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",
