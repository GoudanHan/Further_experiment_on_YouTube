Some define him as an expert institutional investor, while others know him as a large scale installation artist, avid outdoorsman, professor, decision strategist, coach, business leader, mindfulness extremist, author, speaker, daredevil or Guinness world record holder. In his talk, Stephen explains that what truly defines him aren't titles, but an approach to decision making that transformed him from someone who struggled with simple tasks to a guy who is continuously achieving even his most ambitious dreams.\n\nFor thirty years, he has applied cognitive science to investing, business and life. The result has been the turnaround of numerous institutional businesses, career best returns for managers who have adopted his methods, the development of a $1.25 billion dollar hedge fund and a rapidly shrinking bucket list.\nMr. Duneier teaches graduate courses on Decision Analysis in UCSB\u2019s College of Engineering. His book, AlphaBrain is due for release in early 2017 from Wiley & Sons.\nThrough Bija Advisors, he helps business leaders improve performance by applying proven, proprietary decision-making methods to their own processes.\nHis artwork has been featured around the world and is represented by the Sullivan Goss Gallery. As Commissioner of the League of Professional Educators, Duneier is using cognitive science to alter the landscape of American education. He is the former Head of Currency Option Trading at Bank of America and Emerging Markets at AIG International.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

How was he radicalized, and how did he ultimately get out? In this courageous talk, Christian shares a surprising and counterintuitive solution to hate in all forms. After leaving the white-supremacist skinhead movement that he helped build in the 1980s and 90s, Christian Picciolini co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people disengage from violent extremism. His memoir, White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement\u2014and How I Got Out (Hachette), which details his involvement, and eventual disengagement, from the early American white nationalist movement, will be published on December 26, 2017. Christian lives in Chicago. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

Her commitment stems from personal experience, after running away from home fourteen years old, faced with the prospect of a forced marriage.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

                "description": "Payzee Mahmod was a normal teenager, idolising pop stars and pursuing her education. But her childhood was stolen from her when, at just 16 years old, her parents coerced her into marrying a much older man. Lacking the knowledge, power and language to protest the marriage, Payzee hoped another adult or professional in her life would intervene, help her and stop the marriage. Tragically the marriage went ahead and Payzee turned to self-harm and small acts of rebellion, to try and escape. But then everything changed. Her sister Banaz left her own abusive child marriage andmoved back in with their parents. In January 2006, after months of rumours and death threats, Banaz went missing. Three months later, her body was found in Birmingham - her father, her uncle and 3 other Kurdish men were tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. When Payzee turned 18, she got divorced and arranged Banaz\u2019s funeral - all in the same month. Now she is speaking out on behalf of herself, her sister Banaz, and every child at risk of child marriage, to demand that the current law in England and Wales which shockingly allows marriage from 16 with parental consent is changed and that child marriage under the age of 18 becomes a crime. A survivor of child marriage, who lost her sister Banaz in a tragic \u201chonour\u201d killing, Payzee\u2019s focus to prevent so called \u201chonour\u201d based abuse and child marriage could not be more personal. A Kurdish immigrant, raised in London, with a successful career in the fashion industry, she uses her voice to speak out as a survivor \u2013 not a victim \u2013 and has made it her mission to be a changemaker, helping to tackle these harmful practices. As an IKWRO ambassador and campaigner, her story and experiences have reached international audiences, including the Kurdish community.  She has spoken widely on the need for changes to the laws surrounding child marriage and \u201chonour\u201d based abuse across radio, television and newspapers and met with government officials and the Home Office to explain first-hand why change is needed to finally make child marriage a crime.

There are psychological aspects to staying motivated for fitness and then a few rules to adopt for success.  The speaker presents his ideas on motivation,  measuring your fitness level, and exercises to become fit.  \n\nOgie Shaw is a native of Raleigh, NC. He is a veteran of the US Army and served in Vietnam. Afterwards, he graduated from UNC at Chapel Hill earning degrees in both Speech and Physical Education, later earning certification as a Health Promotion Director from the Cooper Institute\u00ae in Dallas, Texas. He served with the Portland Police Bureau and later joined a national network of medical and fitness leaders dedicated to teaching the health benefits of daily exercise. He has been an author, counselor, seminary graduate and pastor to Portland-area retirement homes. He has trained the Portland Trailblazers and Seattle Seahawks, and he has been asked to write a book on his work providing fitness training for paraplegics.\n\nOgie has had a passion for fitness, health, business, and music all of his life. His career goal is to establish a model for a fitness lifestyle for Americans that is sufficient to impact physical and mental health. He has given over 5000 speeches on fitness motivation.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

The YouTube star and former NASA engineer describes how this data-backed mindset for life gamification has stuck with him along his journey, and how it impacts the ways he helps (or tricks) his viewers into learning science, engineering, and design. Mark Rober has made a career out of engineering, entertainment, and education. After completing degrees in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University and the University of Southern California, Rober joined NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2004. In his nine years as a NASA engineer, seven of which were on the Mars rover Curiosity team, Rober worked on both the Descent Stage (the jet pack that lowered the Rover to the surface) and some hardware on the Rover top deck for collecting samples. In 2011, Rober\u2019s iPad-based Halloween costume helped launch both his creative costume company, Digital Dudz, and his YouTube channel, which now boasts 3 million subscribers and 400 million views. His videos focus on creative ideas and science- and engineering-based pranks and activities. Rober is a regular guest on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\". Today, he does research and development work for a large technology company in Northern California, where he lives with his wife and son.

                    "description": "Entrepreneur and Speaker Rahim Fazal considers it a person's duty to always stretch personal limits and therefore grow as a human being. Certainly he has put that belief into practice throughout most of his life. At a young age, he is already a successful businessman, an MBA graduate, and a frequent and popular speaker. Passionately willing to take calculated and essential risks in order to achieve his visions, Rahim quietly created an online business while still in high school, negotiated its sale during his Senior year, and then spent two years building a second company and ultimately taking it public. Most recently, Rahim completed his MBA at Canada's top management school, the Richard Ivey School of Business. Because of his achievements, he was the youngest student in the school's 80 year history accepted without a prerequisite university degree. Rahim is a frequent and popular speaker to high school and college students across the US and Canada. He is also an advisor to the Extreme Entrepreneurship Education Corporation in New York City, an organization helping young people realize the value of pursuing entrepreneurship through education and outreach.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

And yet, we are wiping out the very animals we should celebrate; we are the flood coming for Noah's Ark. Carl leaves us with a difficult question: Do we have what it takes to let life on earth survive?\n\nCarl Safina\u2019s work has been recognized with MacArthur, Pew, and Guggenheim Fellowships, and his writing has won the Lannan Literary Award and the John Burroughs, James Beard, and George Rabb medals. He has a PhD in ecology from Rutgers University. Safina is the inaugural endowed professor for nature and humanity at Stony Brook University, where he co-chairs the steering committee of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and is founding president of the not-for-profit Safina Center. He hosted the 10-part PBS series Saving the Ocean with Carl Safina. His writing appears in The New York Times, National Geographic, Audubon and other periodicals, and on the Web at National Geographic News and Views, Huffington Post, and CNN.com. Carl Safina\u2019s writing shows how humanity is changing the natural world and what those changes mean for wildlife and for people.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

        "description": "A chance encounter with members of the Ku Klux Klan led black musician Daryl Davis on a quest to determine the source of the hate. His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.\n\nDaryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley\u2019s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.\n\nIn 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.\n\nSince his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a \u201ccertificate of friendship\u201d from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He\u2019s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly\u2019s granddaughter.\n\nDavis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations. He is also an actor with stage and screen credits, appearing in the critically acclaimed HBO police drama, The Wire, and most recently, as the subject of the documentary Accidental Courtesy, which filmed his real life encounters with Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leaders as he helps to dismantle racism across the United States\n\n Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations.

They\u2019ve been invited onto late-night talk shows, they\u2019ve shattered records, they\u2019ve sold out stadiums, they\u2019ve made it onto the big screen. These days, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find someone who didn\u2019t know who these guys were or haven\u2019t heard at least one of their songs. The success of the Bangtan Boys is worldwide, but it wasn\u2019t always like this. Follow the journey of the members of BTS when they started as unknowns in their pre-debut days, to the superstars they are today!\n\nEdited by Matt Bacera\n\nWant to support our channel?
