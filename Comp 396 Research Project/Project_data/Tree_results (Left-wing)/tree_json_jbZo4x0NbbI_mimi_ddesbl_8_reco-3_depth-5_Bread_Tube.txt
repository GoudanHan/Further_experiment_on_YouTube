The thesis of the talk I gave: Millennials don't exist and the entire idea of \"generations\" is unscientific, condescending, and stupid. For more misconception destruction, check out my show ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING on TruTV!\n\nUPDATE: Since making this video, I've met Jean Twenge, who let me know that she felt I had misunderstood (and thus misrepresented) some of her research. I'm always eager to hear from an expert - which Jean genuinely is on this topic - so we sat down for a special episode of the Adam Ruins Everything podcast to talk about Jean's research on generations and my reservations about the term. Enjoy! ",

                    "description": "Relaxing in this cozy cabin ambience with heavy thunderstorm sounds. The soothing rain sounds at night serves for sleep and study.Today Let me introduce you to one of my last favorite ambiences. Rain falls on the roof of the cozy cabin, while the sounds of thunderstorm are heard nearby. For me, this may be the perfect recipe for sleeping white noise and the perfect sound for studying. 3 hours of pure relaxation from rain with thunderstorm. The cozy rain sounds white noise creates a natural masking of the sound that blocks out another noise, helping you to fall asleep and sleep all night, or you can also use it to study. Sleep well tonight with the soft sounds of rain and thunder! The appearance of this cozy cabin I created is relatively dark, which can help keep the room dark while you sleep. If you struggle with insomnia, the sound of rain can help, providing a relaxing ambience for your room. The natural sound of cozy rain can also help you focus. This can help you increase your concentration, be a more productive student and do better at school.\n\nI hope you enjoy this cozy  cabin ambience as much as I enjoyed creating it.\n\nPlease visit our website and check out your favorite sleep sounds available to purchase:",
