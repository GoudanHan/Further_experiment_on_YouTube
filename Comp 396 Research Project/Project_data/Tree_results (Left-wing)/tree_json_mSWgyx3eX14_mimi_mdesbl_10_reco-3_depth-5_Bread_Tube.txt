                        "description": "\"What a Wonderful World\" [1970 Spoken Introduction Version] along with Oliver Nelson's Orchestra is a song written by Bob Thiele (as George Douglas) and George David Weiss. It was first recorded by Louis Armstrong and released as a single in 1967.  Thiele and Weiss were both prominent in the music world (Thiele as a producer and Weiss as a composer/performer). Armstrong's recording was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Intended as an antidote for the increasingly racially and politically charged climate of everyday life in the United States, the song also has a hopeful, optimistic tone with regard to the future, with reference to babies being born into the world and having much to look forward to. The song was initially offered to Tony Bennett, who turned it down. Thereafter, it was offered to Louis Armstrong.\n\nLouis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 -- July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American jazz trumpeter and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nComing to prominence in the 1920s as an \"inventive\" trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at scat singing (vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics).\n\nRenowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\", whose skin color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation during the Little Rock Crisis. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a black man.\n\nArmstrong died of a heart attack in his sleep on July 6, 1971 at the age of 69, 11 months after playing a famous show at the Waldorf-Astoria's Empire Room. He was residing in Corona, Queens, New York City, at the time of his death. He was interred in Flushing Cemetery, Flushing, in Queens, New York City. His honorary pallbearers included Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Pearl Bailey, Count Basie, Harry James, Frank Sinatra, Ed Sullivan, Earl Wilson, Alan King, Johnny Carson and David Frost. Peggy Lee sang The Lord's Prayer at the services while Al Hibbler sang \"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\" and Fred Robbins, a long-time friend, gave the eulogy.\n\nArmstrong was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972 by the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. This Special Merit Award is presented by vote of the Recording Academy's National Trustees to performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording.    Recordings of Armstrong were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old, and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\"\n\n\"Some of you young folks been saying to me\n\" Hey Pops, what you mean 'What a wonderful world'?\n\n How about all them wars all over the place? \nYou call them wonderful?\n\n And how about hunger and pollution? \nThat ain't so wonderful either.\"\n\nWell how about listening to old Pops for a minute. \nSeems to me, it aint the world that's so bad \nbut what we're doin' to it.\n\n And all I'm saying is see what a wonderful world \nIt would be if only we'd give it a chance. \nLove baby, love. That's the secret, yeah.\nIf lots more of us loved each other\nwe'd solve lots more problems. \n And then this world would be gasser.\n\nThat's wha' ol' Pops keeps saying.\"\n\nI see trees of green, red roses too\nI see them bloom, for me and you\nAnd I think to myself\nWhat a wonderful world\n\nI see skies of blue, and clouds of white\nThe bright blessed day, dark sacred night\nAnd I think to myself\nWhat a wonderful world\n\nThe colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky\nAre also on the faces, of people going by\nI see friends shaking hands, sayin', \"How do you do?\"\nThey're really sayin', \"I love you\"\n\nI hear babies cryin', I watch them grow\nThey'll learn much more, than I'll ever know\nAnd I think to myself\nWhat a wonderful world\n\nYes, I think to myself\nWhat a wonderful world\nOh yeah!",

Get your copy here: http://thebeatles1.lnk.to/DeluxeBluRay\n\"In We Can Work It Out, Paul did the first half, I did the middle eight. But you've got Paul writing, 'We can work it out, we can work it out' - real optimistic, y'know, and me impatient, 'Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend'.\" (John Lennon)\n'We Can Work It Out' became The Beatles' sixth single in a row to top the US charts. At the time, no other band had achieved such success. The track took over 11 hours to perfect - up to this point, that was the longest period The Beatles had spent in the studio on a single song. \nAt Twickenham Film Studios, a little over three weeks after the single was recorded, The Beatles made three separate promo films for 'We Can Work It Out'. Like all the other films shot that day, the medium was two-inch black and white videotape, a relatively new format for the time. Many TV stations, however, weren't set up for videotape, so 16mm copies were made for distribution worldwide.\nYou can find out more and pre-order at ",

Get your copy here: http://thebeatles1.lnk.to/DeluxeBluRay\n\"In We Can Work It Out, Paul did the first half, I did the middle eight. But you've got Paul writing, 'We can work it out, we can work it out' - real optimistic, y'know, and me impatient, 'Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend'.\" (John Lennon)\n'We Can Work It Out' became The Beatles' sixth single in a row to top the US charts. At the time, no other band had achieved such success. The track took over 11 hours to perfect - up to this point, that was the longest period The Beatles had spent in the studio on a single song. \nAt Twickenham Film Studios, a little over three weeks after the single was recorded, The Beatles made three separate promo films for 'We Can Work It Out'. Like all the other films shot that day, the medium was two-inch black and white videotape, a relatively new format for the time. Many TV stations, however, weren't set up for videotape, so 16mm copies were made for distribution worldwide.\nYou can find out more and pre-order at ",

Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nWritten by John as an expression of his love for Yoko Ono, the song is heartfelt and passionate. As John told Rolling Stone magazine in 1970, \u201cWhen it gets down to it, when you\u2019re drowning, you don\u2019t say, \u2018I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me,\u2019 you just scream.\u201d\n\nDuring filming on the roof of Apple, two days after the recording of the track, the band played \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 right after doing two versions of 'Get Back\u2019 and it led straight into 'I\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u2019. Michael Lindsay-Hogg was once again directing a Beatles\u2019 shoot. He and Paul met regularly at the tail end of 1968, while Hogg was directing The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, to discuss the filming of The Beatles\u2019 session in January. By the time that fateful Thursday came around, the penultimate day of January would be the last time The Beatles ever played together in front of any kind of audience.\n\nThis is not the version of \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 heard on the single but the version from the Let It Be\u2026 Naked album \u2013 a composite of both versions that were performed on the roof of Apple in Savile Row\n\nOfficial site: ",

Get your copy here: http://thebeatles1.lnk.to/DeluxeBluRay\n\"In We Can Work It Out, Paul did the first half, I did the middle eight. But you've got Paul writing, 'We can work it out, we can work it out' - real optimistic, y'know, and me impatient, 'Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend'.\" (John Lennon)\n'We Can Work It Out' became The Beatles' sixth single in a row to top the US charts. At the time, no other band had achieved such success. The track took over 11 hours to perfect - up to this point, that was the longest period The Beatles had spent in the studio on a single song. \nAt Twickenham Film Studios, a little over three weeks after the single was recorded, The Beatles made three separate promo films for 'We Can Work It Out'. Like all the other films shot that day, the medium was two-inch black and white videotape, a relatively new format for the time. Many TV stations, however, weren't set up for videotape, so 16mm copies were made for distribution worldwide.\nYou can find out more and pre-order at ",

Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nHey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles longest-running No.1 in the US singles chart as well as the single with the longest running time.  \n\nThe Beatles did not record their promotional film until Hey Jude had been on sale in America for a week. They returned to Twickenham Film Studio, using director Michael Lindsay-Hogg who had worked with them on Paperback Writer and Rain. Earlier still, Lindsay-Hogg had directed episodes of Ready Steady Go! And a few months after the film for Hey Jude he made The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special that featured John and Yoko but wouldn\u2019t be shown until 1996\n\nTo help with the filming an audience of around 300 local people, as well as some of the fans that gathered regularly outside Abbey Road Studios were brought in for the song\u2019s finale. Their presence had an unlikely upside for The Beatles in their long-running saga with the Musicians\u2019 Union in that the MU were fooled into believing the band were playing live, when in fact they were miming for the vast majority of the song. Paul, however, sang live throughout the song.\n\nThe video was first broadcast on David Frost\u2019s Frost On Sunday show, four days after it was filmed. At that point transmission was in black and white although the promo was originally shot in colour. It was first aired in America a month later on 6 October 1968, on The Smotheres Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nConnect with The Beatles:\nFacebook ",

            "description": "The Beatles 1 Video Collection is out now. Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nWritten by John as an expression of his love for Yoko Ono, the song is heartfelt and passionate. As John told Rolling Stone magazine in 1970, \u201cWhen it gets down to it, when you\u2019re drowning, you don\u2019t say, \u2018I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me,\u2019 you just scream.\u201d\n\nDuring filming on the roof of Apple, two days after the recording of the track, the band played \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 right after doing two versions of 'Get Back\u2019 and it led straight into 'I\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u2019. Michael Lindsay-Hogg was once again directing a Beatles\u2019 shoot. He and Paul met regularly at the tail end of 1968, while Hogg was directing The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, to discuss the filming of The Beatles\u2019 session in January. By the time that fateful Thursday came around, the penultimate day of January would be the last time The Beatles ever played together in front of any kind of audience.\n\nThis is not the version of \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 heard on the single but the version from the Let It Be\u2026 Naked album \u2013 a composite of both versions that were performed on the roof of Apple in Savile Row\n\nOfficial site: ",

        "description": "The Beatles 1 Video Collection is out now. Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nWritten by John as an expression of his love for Yoko Ono, the song is heartfelt and passionate. As John told Rolling Stone magazine in 1970, \u201cWhen it gets down to it, when you\u2019re drowning, you don\u2019t say, \u2018I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me,\u2019 you just scream.\u201d\n\nDuring filming on the roof of Apple, two days after the recording of the track, the band played \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 right after doing two versions of 'Get Back\u2019 and it led straight into 'I\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u2019. Michael Lindsay-Hogg was once again directing a Beatles\u2019 shoot. He and Paul met regularly at the tail end of 1968, while Hogg was directing The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, to discuss the filming of The Beatles\u2019 session in January. By the time that fateful Thursday came around, the penultimate day of January would be the last time The Beatles ever played together in front of any kind of audience.\n\nThis is not the version of \u2018Don\u2019t Let Me Down\u2019 heard on the single but the version from the Let It Be\u2026 Naked album \u2013 a composite of both versions that were performed on the roof of Apple in Savile Row\n\nOfficial site: ",
