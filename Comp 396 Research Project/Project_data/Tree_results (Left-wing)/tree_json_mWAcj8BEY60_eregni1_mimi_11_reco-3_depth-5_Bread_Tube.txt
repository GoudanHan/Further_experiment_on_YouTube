Hasan also explores how cricket has especially grown in India due in part to the creation of the IPL, a flashy professional cricket league founded by the infamous Lalit Modi, and how that expansion has unfortunately come at the expense of the growth of cricket in other countries.\n\nWatch Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj on Netflix: ",

With billions of fans scheduled to tune into the upcoming 2019 Cricket World Cup, Hasan examines how the game has evolved from a sport of British colonizers into a tool of diplomacy and a force for good despite recent scandals and corruption. Hasan also explores how cricket has especially grown in India due in part to the creation of the IPL, a flashy professional cricket league founded by the infamous Lalit Modi, and how that expansion has unfortunately come at the expense of the growth of cricket in other countries.\n\nWatch Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj on Netflix: ",

These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

                "description": "This speech is a call to action. We spend about eighty percent of our day at work, the rest is at home. If we have a bad day at work we are likely to take that negativity home with us and vice versa. It is of paramount importance that we create healthy environments in the spaces that most affect our lives by giving of our best and receiving the like in return. The 5 Chairs is a powerful and systematic method which helps us master our own behaviours and manage the behaviours of others. To be a good leader is to contribute to the success and happiness of everyone, at work and at home, on a conscious level. The 5 Chairs offer 5 Choices. Which will you choose?\n\nBehavioral Coach, Corporate Trainer, Author of \u20185 Chairs 5 Choices\u2019. Louise Evans heads up her own organization in Florence, Italy from which she offers international leadership development, cross-cultural transitional coaching and personal development programmes for individuals and teams working in international contexts. She is English but has lived and worked in Germany, France and for the last 30 years in Italy. \nThree things have always been important in her life - people, travel and the performing arts - all three of which she combines in her daily work. Having travelled to seven-five countries and experienced culture shock three times, Louise brings multiple perspectives to the present moment to help people connect across their differences. Louise believes deeply in people\u2019s ability to grow and transform. What she values most is helping people strengthen their self-awareness and their understanding of others so that they bring their best selves into the world in every situation.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

But what came with that was a sharp lesson on what it takes to be brave, and it\u2019s not what you think. From under the polar ice or up to 6\u2019000 meters altitude, adventure & documentary photographer Franck Gazzola brings back images from the roads less travelled and angles less often seen. Only years later, after travelling the world during a successful corporate career, he picked up a camera again. Quickly, his passion became his full-time career, but more importantly he found a great sense of purpose in documenting inspiring stories. He is currently in charge of the imagery & the documentary/editorial photography for the ''Under The Pole III'' expedition, a groundbreaking underwater exploration expedition that traversed the globe from the frozen waters of the Arctic to the deep blue waters of the Pacific from 2017 to 2021.\n \nFranck is also a public speaker who shares his experience, passion, and on-field stories not only about his Photography but also about the radical changes he went through swapping his suit & tie for a camera backpack, hiking shoes, and diving tanks.

He exited the forest, on the brink of death and still haunted by personal demons, to eventually gain a Ph.D., become a university lecturer in the Faculty of Business, Law, and Arts and become an ambassador for Australia\u2019s \u2018forgotten children\u2019. This incredible story is a personal testament to \u2018never giving up\u2019. Dr. Gregory P. Smith is a survivor, an academic, and a social researcher. Homeless for much of his adult life living as a recluse in a forest near Byron Bay, he now has a Ph.D. in Sociology and teaches at Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. In 2018 he published his memoir \u2018Out of the Forest\u2019 with Penguin Random House and has been the subject of two Australian documentaries. His profoundly touching and uplifting memoir is at once a unique insight into how far off track a life can go and a powerful reminder that we can all find our way back. Gregory is heavily involved in advocating for the vulnerable and disadvantaged and continues to be the patron of a number of charity organisations while also consulting with several specialist services and agencies. Currently, Dr. Smith is engaged as a consultant and program evaluator in the Premiers Priority Project to reduce rough sleeping in NSW, Australia by 50% in 2025 and zero by 2030.

Following a near death-like experience this popular physician and medical journalist realized that her past conditioning was causing her to live an inauthentic life that created depression and anxiety. She dug deep into her shadow to overcome low self-esteem, learn to love herself and transform her entire life. In this inspiring talk at TEDxIUM, Dr. Andrea Pennington shows how we can learn who we really are - or who we were meant to be - by examining our biology, our personality and temperament and ultimately discovering our unique 'Soulprint' to break free from social conditioning that creates self-loathing and self-rejection.\n\nDr. Andrea Pennington is the Founder and President of Pennington Empowerment Media. An integrative medical doctor, acupuncturist and Positive Psychology coach, she empowers people to go from \u201csurviving to thriving\u201d by embracing their strengths and talents and sharing them with the world in a powerful way. As an investigative journalist she produces television programs and documentaries about the soul and science of wellness, longevity and optimal living. Dr. Pennington provides values-based brand development consulting for individuals and small companies who wish to make an impact in the world through digital and broadcast media.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

                "description": "Nuclear physics, astronomy and molecular biology truly lack complexity when they are juxtaposed to one word: relationships. Interpersonal relationships represent probably one of the most complicated ideas that have troubled the human mind.\n\nWhether it's aristocracy, models, professional athletes or every day couples they all face the same difficulty of making their relationships work. Diana Wais talked about how \"we are all the same\" and how we respond with criticism when we feel threatened by words. \n\nHowever, it is important to \"respond to the other person's need with empathy\", she said. It is difficult to understand when you are being emotional and when irrational. Her most valid point though was that, as individuals, we need to conquer the unconscious emotions and understand that essentially, we are all fighting the same internal fight.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

He shares five tips to try, whether you\u2019re at the start of your career or contemplating your next act.  \n\n\nExecutive director of Stanford\u2019s design program at the d.School, Bill Burnett uses design thinking, a career\u2019s worth of starting companies and coaching students, and a childhood spent drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother\u2019s sewing machine to inform his work on how to design your life. In five eyebrow-raising findings, Burnett offers simple but life-changing advice on designing the life you want, whether you are contemplating college or retirement. \n\nAfter years of drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother\u2019s sewing machine, Bill Burnett went to college where he discovered that there were people in the world who did this kind of thing every day (without the sewing machine), and they were called designers. Thirty years, five companies, and a couple thousand students later, Burnett is still drawing and building things, teaching others how to do the same, and quietly enjoying the fact that no one has discovered that he is having too much fun. As Executive Director of the Design Program at Stanford, he runs undergraduate and graduate programs in design, both interdepartmental programs between the mechanical engineering and art departments. Burnett worked on design of the award-winning Apple PowerBooks and the original Hasbro Star Wars action figures. He holds a number of mechanical and design patents.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

Let\u2019s pull back the curtain on that, and look at a spectrum of learning pathways for growing your own knowledge. I want them to walk away from this talk with their boundaries moved. They can, and should, learn more than they think they can. I want them to have another tool in their belt for discovery, another lens through which they can view their own potential genius.\n\nWhat action items do you want people to take away from your talk? \u201c1. Grow. 2. Grow.\u201d\n\n\nBen Vandgrift struggles daily with a compulsion to solve problems. His decades-old journey has most recently led him to Clojure, allowing him to solve many software problems elegantly and efficiently. He works as a software engineer when he\u2019s not being mauled by his rescue panther.\n\nI struggle with a problem-solving compulsion.

According to Nixon, we know that kids and adults are suffering. In fact, some research studies have shown that rates of depression and anxiety have actually increased over the past 50 years. According to recent research, we know that approximately 1 in 5 youth will suffer from a major depressive episode by the time they leave high school. In the middle of our fast paced, technologically driven world, adolescents stand before you \u2014 searching for purpose\u2026 searching to fit in and belong. After decades of research of those who have studied this field, one thing is very clear: meaningful connections serve as protective factors in the lives of our youth. Nixon shares her ideas on how we can help our youth build those meaningful connections.\n\nDr. Charisse Nixon is currently a Professor of Psychology at Penn State Behrend. She trains educators throughout the United States providing a unique integration of empirical research and practical strategies to help caring adults create environments that optimize children and adolescents\u2019 developmental outcomes. Her research interests currently include studying effective prevention and intervention efforts related to reducing peer mistreatment and its associated harm. Building students\u2019 resiliency through mentoring is a core tenet of her work. Charisse has a heart for young people\u2013for young people to actually thrive and not just survive, to be the best that they can be.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Such circumstances can make us feel crazy. How do we get around it? Movement pattern analysis. Each of us has a fingerprint. Those who understand the system can tell a great deal about people by watching them move. But we can also use it. As Driver tells us, whenever something is driving her nuts, she now wiggles. It is a movement from early childhood, and one CANNOT be angry when one is wiggling. This, she tells us, can save you headaches, and more importantly, friends.\n\nJanine Driver\u2019s mission is to INSPIRE people to look at their world in a different way. Janine is the New York Times Best Selling author of You Say More Than You Think, and more recently You Can\u2019t Lie To Me, award-winning keynote speaker, and body language expert for NBC\u2019s TODAY Show. Janine is the CEO and founder of the Body Language Institute and the elite division called the Decision Profiling Group.\nJanine and the Body Language Institute have helped Fortune 500 clients become examples of the total leader, which ultimately led them to win millions of dollars in new business contracts.\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California).

He read over 1,000 books in just under six years. By studying original texts in psychology and philosophy, he sought to better understand himself and his past behaviour. He credits books as being the lifeblood of his rehabilitation.\nShaun now tells his story to schools to put young people off drugs and crime.

We all have a unique personality, but we also show up to others in ways we don\u2019t know.  Understanding how our brains become consciously aware of ourselves, and in turn, everyone else teaches how we can connect, adapt and ultimately influence others.  It all starts with knowing when we are truly self-aware, and when we aren\u2019t, how to get there quickly and easily.\n\nScott Schwefel built and sold Minnesota\u2019s largest technology training company. To get there he used personality assessments to help his people understand each other and understand clients and customers. His study of personality led to an awareness of brain science and how our brains enable us to communicate with each other. Scott has taught these principles of brain science and communications techniques throughout North America, Europe and Asia, and to over 1300 CEOs globally.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.
