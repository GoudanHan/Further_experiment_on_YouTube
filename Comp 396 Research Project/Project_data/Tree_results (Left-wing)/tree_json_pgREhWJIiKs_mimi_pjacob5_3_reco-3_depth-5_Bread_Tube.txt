Here you will find songs with soothing warm pianos and delightful violin melodies. Some of the tracks contain sounds of nature such as rain, waterfalls, and the seashore waves that decrease stress and anxiety. It is proven that calming background music with sustained sounds improves focus and boosts motivation. During long studies or work sessions, our radio will aid your endurance. Neoclassical tracks are famous for minimizing distractions while white noise present in these tunes optimizes concentration, reduces the learning curve and working time, and improves creativity and clarity. \n\nFor best results keep our music in the background to accord both sides of the brain, prepare to seize this day, and as always, enjoy the music!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Image author and inspirator \n Micha\u0142 Karcz\n https://www.behance.net/gallery/64984...\n https://www.deviantart.com/karezoid\n https://500px.com/p/karezoid?view=photos\n https://www.michalkarcz.com/copy-of-home\n\n\nWe have created a new channel and we really need your help.\n \ud83d\ude4f Please like, comment or subscribe.\nGenre: Ambient,  Drone, Modern Classical, Contemporary classical music\nStyle: Downtempo, Spacey Ambient\nMood: Inspiring, Peaceful, Night, Smooth, Calming, Soothing, Space, Nature\nDuration: 24/7\nFeature: Without Lyrics, No vocals\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 Similar videos\nEnergy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nFuture Garage \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nMusic Genres \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAll Music VIdeos \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nWork Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillout Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nStudy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nHacker Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAmbient Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillstep Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n\n #AmbientMusicLive #DroneMusicBackground #ContemporaryClassicalMusic",

A calm and beautiful selection of recordings I made for you during the past years. \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find more calm piano music also on my YT channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find my music is also on:\nSpotify:   \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailySpotify\n\nApple Music:    \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailyAppleMusic\n\nrelaxdaily Instagram:      \nhttps://www.instagram.com/relaxdaily/\n\nweb: https://relaxdaily.net\n\nI hope you enjoy the music and have a calm and wonderful day in your style, at your pace.\nMichael (relaxdaily)*\n\nFor new music videos (and 24/7 music streams) see: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily (tick the notification bell when subbing if you like to receive notifications on new music)\n\nThis relaxdaily project (= me creating calm music) can be nourished via Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/relaxdaily\n\n*If you\u2019re new to my music project: I\u2019m Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. \n\nI believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

Diplomats and support staff are being flown out of the capital after it was seized by the Taliban. US forces are in control of the airport. It's the last exit point out of Afghanistan not overseen by the militants. On Monday, several people died after crowds rushed onto the runway trying to escape the country.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden has rejected blame for the Taliban takeover. He admitted his administration had assessed the situation incorrectly, but vehemently defended his decision to remove US troops from Afghanistan. If anything, he said, the way events unfolded proved him right. \n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she felt most for those who spent the last 20 years hoping for a more liberal society.\n\n\nSubscribe: ",
