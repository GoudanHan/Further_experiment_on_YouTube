Earlier, both the S&P 500 and Dow dropped more than 1% to post a back-to-back session of losses. Treasury yields retreated across the long end of the curve, and the benchmark 10-year yield sank back below 1.3%. \n\nShares of Robinhood (HOOD) dropped more than 8% after the trading platform delivered its first earnings report since going public, with the print pointing to a revenue slowdown in the current period due to seasonal weakness in third-quarter trading. Cisco Systems (CSCO), a Dow component, also saw shares drop after its sales and profit guidance disappointed against some lofty Wall Street expectations. \n\nEquity markets have come under pressure on the back of the Federal Reserve's July meeting minutes. These suggested central bankers were moving forward with their debate over the timing and scope of the tapering of their crisis-era asset purchase program, with most participants expecting the U.S. economy to make enough of a recovery to meet the \"substantial further progress\" necessary to trigger a slowdown in purchases by later this year. \n\nNew data on the labor market on Thursday appeared to vindicate the Fed's assessment of the recovery. Initial unemployment claims took a major step lower last week, falling to the lowest level since March 2020, and signaling another leap forward in improvements in the labor market. \n\n\"With a growing number of officials now openly discussing the possibility of tapering beginning soon on the back of July\u2019s strong employment report, it looks more likely than not that the wind-down will begin later this year, rather than early next year as we had previously thought,\" Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note.\n\nFor more on this article, please visit:\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-...",

A calm and beautiful selection of recordings I made for you during the past years. \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find more calm piano music also on my YT channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find my music is also on:\nSpotify:   \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailySpotify\n\nApple Music:    \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailyAppleMusic\n\nrelaxdaily Instagram:      \nhttps://www.instagram.com/relaxdaily/\n\nweb: https://relaxdaily.net\n\nI hope you enjoy the music and have a calm and wonderful day in your style, at your pace.\nMichael (relaxdaily)*\n\nFor new music videos (and 24/7 music streams) see: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily (tick the notification bell when subbing if you like to receive notifications on new music)\n\nThis relaxdaily project (= me creating calm music) can be nourished via Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/relaxdaily\n\n*If you\u2019re new to my music project: I\u2019m Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. \n\nI believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

Africa remains the most vulnerable continent despite contributing the least to greenhouse gas emissions.

From the American Colony Hotel in Jerusalem to Le Bristol in Paris and Das Adlon in Berlin, each enchants with its beauty, history and fascinating stories of famous visitors.\n\nNow, we pay a visit to the Beau-Rivage, in Geneva. With its stunning view of Lake Geneva, the hotel has attracted actors from Roger Moore to Angelina Jolie, and played host to political luminaries like Kofi Annan, Charles de Gaulle and the Dalai Lama. \n\nPolitical history has been made here, too: In 1898, the Empress \"Sisi\" of Austria was stabbed to death by an anarchist at the Beau-Rivage. Nearly a hundred years later, in 1987, the German politician Uwe Barschel was discovered dead here, in a bathtub.\n\nFamily-run for generations, the hotel is impressive not just for its size, but also for its discretion. Now, director Jacques Mayer uses interviews, archival film and rarely seen photographs to vividly chronicle some of the most fateful years of the Beau-Rivage. \n\nLegendary hotels (4-part series):\nLe Bristol in Paris - ",

                    "description": "The avocado is a new superfood and its cultivation has been increasing worldwide, including in southern Portugal. But avocado plantations suck up the water in the already drought-stricken country. Local residents and small farmers are fighting back.\n\nMatthew Ambrose had imagined his ninth summer running a vacation quinta in Portugal quite differently. For decades, Matthew ran bars and discos in the UK. Now he wants to live a quieter life in a small guesthouse surrounded by a green garden, with his donkey, a pony and two dogs. But he fears that his only well will run dry and his land will become barren. Noisy excavators surround his property. A large Portuguese fruit-growing company is tearing up cork oak and prickly pear trees and laying water pipes to create a 50-hectare avocado plantation. Three deep wells have already been sunk - even though, as Matthew points out, locals are strictly forbidden from drilling new wells after many years of low rainfall and forest fires. But the company got permits from the Portuguese authorities. Matthew frets that the company will intensively operate the plantation for ten or 20 years, causing the water table to drop and wells in the area to dry up and leaving the soil depleted and without nutrients. Despite this, the authorities are approving increasingly larger plantations, which are also promoted by the EU. This report talks to avocado farmers, local residents and citizens' groups and asks: Are Portugal's avocados like \"green gold\u201d - or just a short-term money-spinner with expensive long-term consequences?\n\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

At airfields around the world, the company\u2019s jets sit idle, just waiting. The hope? Tourists will want to fly, in greater numbers than ever before.\n\nLufthansa has long relied on business travellers for revenue. But that segment of the travel industry is unlikely to recover anytime soon. So the company is changing its strategy, and targeting tourists. They\u2019ve created a new subsidiary, \"Eurowings Discover,\" that's aimed at attracting holiday-makers. But this is anything but a sure thing: Several other airlines are targeting the same market, and the competition for these customers is fierce. \n\nThis documentary outlines some of the strategies that airlines have developed to deal with the reduced passenger traffic brought on by the pandemic\u2014one of the biggest aviation crises, ever. The challenges are manifold: Many airlines received huge government subsidies to help them get through pandemic crisis. Nonetheless, most workers in airline sector haven\u2019t had full-time work since the pandemic began. What might the future hold?",
