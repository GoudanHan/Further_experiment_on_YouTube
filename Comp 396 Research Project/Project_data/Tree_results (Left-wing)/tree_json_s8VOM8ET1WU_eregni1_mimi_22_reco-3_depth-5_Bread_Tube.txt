What started from Grandma\u2019s secret fried chicken recipe has evolved into three generations working together under one roof, day in and day out. At the center of it all is Rahman, who single-handedly fries every piece of chicken, along with his two daughters, his mother, and his father.

This is not a Japan Day in the Life the video, but it captures what happens behind the scenes of a  local japanese restaurant setting up in the morning and getting ready for lunch.  This Tokyo Restaurant, Bulldog, is a traditional Japanese Western influenced style restaurant that usually has customer lines almost longer than its history.   Just a 3 minutes walk away from Oimachi Station, this shop was opened post war in 1949 in what was considered a black market area but evolved over time and now situated in this historic hidden backstreet alleyway known as Higashi Koji Shotengai amongst other bars and restaurants with a similar history.  The owner. Suzuki san or as everyone refers to him Sensei which means Teacher in English is a second generation shop owner as it was passed down from his father.
