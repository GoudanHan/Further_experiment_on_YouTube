Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nHey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles longest-running No.1 in the US singles chart as well as the single with the longest running time.  \n\nThe Beatles did not record their promotional film until Hey Jude had been on sale in America for a week. They returned to Twickenham Film Studio, using director Michael Lindsay-Hogg who had worked with them on Paperback Writer and Rain. Earlier still, Lindsay-Hogg had directed episodes of Ready Steady Go! And a few months after the film for Hey Jude he made The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special that featured John and Yoko but wouldn\u2019t be shown until 1996\n\nTo help with the filming an audience of around 300 local people, as well as some of the fans that gathered regularly outside Abbey Road Studios were brought in for the song\u2019s finale. Their presence had an unlikely upside for The Beatles in their long-running saga with the Musicians\u2019 Union in that the MU were fooled into believing the band were playing live, when in fact they were miming for the vast majority of the song. Paul, however, sang live throughout the song.\n\nThe video was first broadcast on David Frost\u2019s Frost On Sunday show, four days after it was filmed. At that point transmission was in black and white although the promo was originally shot in colour. It was first aired in America a month later on 6 October 1968, on The Smotheres Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nConnect with The Beatles:\nFacebook ",

Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nHey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles longest-running No.1 in the US singles chart as well as the single with the longest running time.  \n\nThe Beatles did not record their promotional film until Hey Jude had been on sale in America for a week. They returned to Twickenham Film Studio, using director Michael Lindsay-Hogg who had worked with them on Paperback Writer and Rain. Earlier still, Lindsay-Hogg had directed episodes of Ready Steady Go! And a few months after the film for Hey Jude he made The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special that featured John and Yoko but wouldn\u2019t be shown until 1996\n\nTo help with the filming an audience of around 300 local people, as well as some of the fans that gathered regularly outside Abbey Road Studios were brought in for the song\u2019s finale. Their presence had an unlikely upside for The Beatles in their long-running saga with the Musicians\u2019 Union in that the MU were fooled into believing the band were playing live, when in fact they were miming for the vast majority of the song. Paul, however, sang live throughout the song.\n\nThe video was first broadcast on David Frost\u2019s Frost On Sunday show, four days after it was filmed. At that point transmission was in black and white although the promo was originally shot in colour. It was first aired in America a month later on 6 October 1968, on The Smotheres Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nConnect with The Beatles:\nFacebook ",

Three divisions of man: Spirit, soul, and body. \n\nSo much of God's purpose is revealed in threes, Pastor Rod Parsley teaches about the divine revelation of faith we can glean from one of the 3 women who witnessed the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus at Calvary - all named \"Mary\" - and how to walk in future-forming faith that captures the attention of God ... faith that God calls great!\n\n* Prayer Needs: \nhttps://www.rodparsley.com/prayer\n\n* Sow online: \nhttps://www.rodparsley.tv/give\n\n* Ministry Resources:\nhttps://store.rodparsley.com/\n\n\n=== CHAPTERS ===\n(available after the service) \n\n\n#3MarysOfCalvary #FutureFormingFaith #Faith\n\nDr. Rod Parsley\nThe 3 Marys of Calvary: The Mary of Faith\nSumrall Tabernacle\nWorld Harvest Church, Columbus, Ohio\n#MaryOfFaith #WorldHarvestChurch #RodParsley #Calvary #TheCross",

How you react in the problem you\u2019re facing will determine how long you stay there. What is your attitude like? Are you asking God to help you face the giants and marching through to the Promised Land in your own life?  Or are you pouting and asking God why He isn\u2019t doing more for you, while you\u2019re sit on the couch and whining about life\u2019s challenges? If you want to realize your life\u2019s dreams and goals\u2026it\u2019s time to read the Word, soak up God\u2019s love and move forward down the path of HIS choosing. To receive God\u2019s promise you have to be willing to let go of the problem and move forward toward total freedom through Christ Jesus. You will never achieve your highest destiny without following God\u2019s plan for your life.",

Cognitive research reveals that images, metaphors and stories are the basis of our mental operating system: the origin of our intuitions and our irrationality. Counterintuitively, more accurate insights do not come from increasing information or reason, but educating our imagination.\n\nCharles Faulkner is an independent researcher on language and its effects on communication, decision-making and change. He has worked in the Silicon Valley, \u2018the City\u2019 of London and 3M, HP, IBM, HSBC and Cargill. His decision-making work is featured in books including The New Market Wizards. His popular works include the audio programs: The New Technology of Achievement, Success Mastery, and Creating Irresistible Influence. His original work on metaphoric communication and change is documented in three programs. He has lectured in 15 countries including at the University of Chicago, Columbia College NYC, the Sorbonne, and London School of Economics.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                "description": "Completely disillusioned with a society that rejected him, Gregory P. Smith walked into a rainforest near Byron Bay and became a hermit for 10 years. He exited the forest, on the brink of death and still haunted by personal demons, to eventually gain a Ph.D., become a university lecturer in the Faculty of Business, Law, and Arts and become an ambassador for Australia\u2019s \u2018forgotten children\u2019. This incredible story is a personal testament to \u2018never giving up\u2019. Dr. Gregory P. Smith is a survivor, an academic, and a social researcher. Homeless for much of his adult life living as a recluse in a forest near Byron Bay, he now has a Ph.D. in Sociology and teaches at Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. In 2018 he published his memoir \u2018Out of the Forest\u2019 with Penguin Random House and has been the subject of two Australian documentaries. His profoundly touching and uplifting memoir is at once a unique insight into how far off track a life can go and a powerful reminder that we can all find our way back. Gregory is heavily involved in advocating for the vulnerable and disadvantaged and continues to be the patron of a number of charity organisations while also consulting with several specialist services and agencies. Currently, Dr. Smith is engaged as a consultant and program evaluator in the Premiers Priority Project to reduce rough sleeping in NSW, Australia by 50% in 2025 and zero by 2030.

After traveling through Europe and Canada, she landed in Lake Tahoe, CA, which she still calls home.\nA passion for the outdoors connected Sherry to legendary free ski pioneer Shane McConkey. The two were married in Thailand in 2004 and their greatest creation, Ayla, came along in 2005.

            "description": "Completely disillusioned with a society that rejected him, Gregory P. Smith walked into a rainforest near Byron Bay and became a hermit for 10 years. He exited the forest, on the brink of death and still haunted by personal demons, to eventually gain a Ph.D., become a university lecturer in the Faculty of Business, Law, and Arts and become an ambassador for Australia\u2019s \u2018forgotten children\u2019. This incredible story is a personal testament to \u2018never giving up\u2019. Dr. Gregory P. Smith is a survivor, an academic, and a social researcher. Homeless for much of his adult life living as a recluse in a forest near Byron Bay, he now has a Ph.D. in Sociology and teaches at Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. In 2018 he published his memoir \u2018Out of the Forest\u2019 with Penguin Random House and has been the subject of two Australian documentaries. His profoundly touching and uplifting memoir is at once a unique insight into how far off track a life can go and a powerful reminder that we can all find our way back. Gregory is heavily involved in advocating for the vulnerable and disadvantaged and continues to be the patron of a number of charity organisations while also consulting with several specialist services and agencies. Currently, Dr. Smith is engaged as a consultant and program evaluator in the Premiers Priority Project to reduce rough sleeping in NSW, Australia by 50% in 2025 and zero by 2030.
