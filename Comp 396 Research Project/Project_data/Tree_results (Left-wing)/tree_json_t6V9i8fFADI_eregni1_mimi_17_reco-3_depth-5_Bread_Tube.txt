Join speaker Bruce Ganger as he lays out a simple solution to one of humanity's most fundamental problems.\n\nBruce is the Executive Director of Second Harvest North Florida, a position he has held since September 1, 2011.  Second Harvest rescues and distributes almost 24 million pounds of food throughout a 17-county service area of north Florida, serving the one in six Floridians who struggle to feed themselves and their families. Prior to joining Second Harvest Bruce served as the Managing Director of ISF Group, a business he founded with his wife Peg in 2006 to assist area nonprofits with development, messaging and fundraising.\n\nPrior to starting ISF Group, Bruce spent 25 years in the corporate world, holding many different senior and executive sales and marketing positions with Xerox, Eastman Kodak and Oc\u00e9 Technologies BV.  He has a BA in Sociology from Indiana University and a MBA in Business Management from Almeda University.  As a Kellogg National Fellow (1987-1990), Bruce traveled in the United States and abroad studying leadership and innovation from a global perspective.\n\nBruce and his wife, Peg, have three grown children, five grandchildren and live in Jacksonville, Florida.  He enjoys playing golf, reading and hiking in the Blue Ridge Mountains, and mentoring young professionals in their development and education.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

It starts with federal money, but before USDA funding makes it to cafeterias, many school districts order from food giants like Tyson and PepsiCo who grab a big slice of the school lunch pie.\n\nWe hear a lot about school lunches in America and the food itself doesn't always get the best reputation. From Hollywood depictions to real life memories, the school cafeteria is a quintessential part of American culture. \n\nWho decides what food gets put on the tray? And how come one school serves this on a $1.25 budget, while another serves this? Why are teachers working at McDonald's for a night? And how does a slice of Domino's pizza meet USDA guidelines? \n\nThose are all loaded questions with complicated answers, but if you really boil it down the answer is money. Lots and lots of money.\n\nThe billion lunches that get doled out in school cafeterias every year make up a multibillion dollar industry that makes sure millions of kids are fed. It starts with federal money but on its way to cafeterias, school districts have to order the meals and food giants grab a big slice of the school lunch pie.\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

But nearly half of all plastic produced goes towards single-use items such as bags, straws, utensils and takeout containers. Since the 1950s, humans have produced about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic. Every year, 8 million metric tons end up in the ocean. Globally, only 9% of plastics are recycled. As the waste piles up, there's a growing demand for alternatives. \n\nThere's a number of companies trying to develop cost-efficient and eco-friendly substitutes, from mushroom packaging to advanced fibers and plastic-free online shopping. But it may take serious legislative efforts to incentive adoption and slow the rise of the industry overall.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

Her family embarked on a cultural odyssey that would greatly influence her life: the Stuarts dug up their middle-class roots in Vancouver\u2019s Jewish community and replanted them in a rural Japanese town called Saku for a year.\n\nIt was during this absorbing year that Jessica met Fukue, a bright and bubbly girl with rosy red cheeks and an endless smile. Fukue and Jessica became like sisters, spending their days frolicking in the autumn leaves, dancing under snow-blanketed trees, watching hot air balloons illuminate the skyline in spring and sneaking through rice paddies in early summer.\n\nStrangely, Fukue never invited Jessica to visit her family home. One day after school, Jessica insisted. Fukue reluctantly brought Jessica to her house; it was a derelict shack on the outskirts of town. Shocked and disturbed, Jessica started to make sense of the name-calling and bullying that Fukue suffered at school.\n\nAs the Stuarts\u2019 year in Japan came to an end, Jessica and Fukue assured one another they would keep in touch. They became pen pals, writing letters back and forth for two years, until the letters from Fukue stopped \u2014 with no explanation.\n\nNow a musician in her 30s, Jessica has never forgotten Fukue. Her memories of their time together are beautiful, but haunting. And so her thoughts turn to the unknown. Where is Fukue now? Does she remember Jessica? Why did her letters stop all those years ago?\n\nNow, nearly 30 years after she left Japan, Jessica is going back to find the answers to these questions. She\u2019s going to find Fukue.\n\n***\n\nA special thanks to The Stuart Family, Norie-Ichikawa Doyle and Saku City Junior High School.\n\nMore Shows:",

About 10 years later, the company has grown into a $26 billion fintech behemoth under Jack Dorsey's leadership. Square profits off a lot more than card swipes at your favorite trendy coffee shop. \n\nThe company provides a wide range of software products for sellers that helps simplify everything from payroll to making appointments with customers. Square offers small business loans as well, often in sums smaller than traditional banks are willing to lend to neighborhood stores, restaurants and coffee shops.\n\nOn the consumer side, Square launched Cash App, originally called Square Cash, in 2013. Since then, the app has seen enormous growth, jumping from 7 million to 15 million users in 2018 alone.\n\nSquare credits its success to a mission of economic empowerment for everyone from a small business owner to a major retailer. But critics say the company may have lost focus, be overvalued, and struggle to sustain growth if the U.S. faces an economic downturn.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

At the center of it all are the patients.\n\nAshley Palmiscino's insurance company was billed roughly $4 million for her five-month-old son Luca's lung transplant. Her family had to turn to fundraising almost immediately just to keep up with the medical bills, and she's not alone. One-third of the money raised on GoFundMe last year went to medical campaigns.\n\nSo how did we get here, and how do we turn things around?\n\n\"Once there's all this money sloshing around in a system, there's this sort of pile-on effect where everyone wants to grab their bit of this huge pot of money,\" said Elisabeth Rosenthal, a former physician who wrote a book about how health care became big business.\n\n\"Now what we have as we're trying to take it back and reduce costs is everyone is desperately clinging to their piece of the pie.\"\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

        "description": "Amazon paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2018. On top of that, the company also received a multi-million dollar tax rebate from the federal government. How does the company do it? President Trump's tax cuts, aggressive revenue reinvestment, years of R&D, and employee stock compensation all helped. Does America have a corporate income tax problem?\n\nAmazon is one of the world's most valuable companies, valued at nearly $800 billion, and the e-commerce giant pulled in $232.9 billion in global revenue in 2018.\n\nAnd yet, Amazon's federal tax bill this year: $0. For the second year in a row.\n\nIn fact, Amazon is actually getting a federal tax refund of $129 million this year, due in part to a combination of tax credits and deductions. This is despite the fact that Amazon nearly doubled its taxable income in 2018 to $11.2 billion, from $5.6 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn other words, Amazon is basically paying a -1 percent federal income tax rate this year after reportedly paying a federal rate of more than 11 percent between 2011 and 2016, according to The Week.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has criticized Amazon in the past for not paying higher federal taxes, took to Twitter to point out that any Amazon Prime member paid more for that program's annual fee ($119) than the company paid in federal taxes. Prime has 100 million subscribers.\n\n\"Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNBC Make It.\n\nAmazon reported its sizable federal refund in a recent corporate filing for the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. However, Amazon also notes in that filing that it will pay $756 million in total taxes this year, between state and international taxes.\n\nA report this week from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, or ITEP, a nonpartisan and nonprofit tax policy think tank, pointed out the fact that Amazon will not pay federal taxes for the second year in a row. In fact, last year, Amazon received an even larger refund, getting $137 million from the federal government.\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",
