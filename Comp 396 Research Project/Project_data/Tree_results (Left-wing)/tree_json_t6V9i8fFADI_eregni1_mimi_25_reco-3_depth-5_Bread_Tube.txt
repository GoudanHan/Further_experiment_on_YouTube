At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020. \n\n\nArtist:                   Secret Garden\nAlbum:                Earthsongs\nTrack:                   Lotus\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

His purpose is to inspire health, happiness, and freedom on Earth and he\u2019s dedicated his life to this mission. He has cycled across the United States, twice, on a bamboo bicycle, went 1,000 days without showering, and has dove into thousands of dumpsters across America, all to inspire positive social and environmental change. When not out adventuring he lives off the grid in a fifty-square-foot tiny home in San Diego. His extreme adventures and activism campaigns may appear unattainable at first glance but within them are an abundance of simple lessons and tips that can be adapted into any life to live with more happiness, health, and freedom.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Mike, our sailmaker, is doing everything he can to finish our sails but with the current state of the world being what it is some things are beyond our control. This means we won't be setting sail this season... but we're keeping heads high and spirits up. Rediviva will just be more complete as we wait for the sails to catch up. There's always more to be done! \n\nThanks for watching everyone!\n~Ruthie\n\np.s. if you\u2019re near the SF Bay Area and would like to volunteer you can reach us here: saltandtarcrew@gmail.com.

Vol 1 : Rocks & Fossils,\" the follow-up to our feature-length film where we explore the impact of the global Flood on the Earth. Check it out on our website: http://bit.ly/BIGH-1.\n\nContinuing on their trek through the Pocket Wilderness of Tennessee, Del Tackett and paleontologist Kurt Wise discuss the order in which major groups of fossil organisms first appear in the fossil record. While most do not first appear in the order expected by evolutionary theory, the order of fossil plants appear to do so. Dr. Wise argues that not only can the global Flood of Noah's time also explain the order of fossil plants, but that it can explain it better.\n\nDr. Wise earned his BA in geology from the University of Chicago, and his MA and PhD degrees in paleontology from Harvard University. He founded and directed the Center for Origins Research at Bryan College and taught biology there for 17 years. He then led the Center for Theology and Science at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary for 3 years, before founding and directing the Center for Creation Research and teaching biology at Truett McConnell University for the last 7 years. His fieldwork has included research in early Flood rocks in the Death Valley region, late Flood rocks in Wyoming, and post-Flood caves in Tennessee.\n\nFor more information on Dr. Kurt Wise, please go to ",

In preparation for an invasion of Japan, allied navies engaged, for the first time, in major naval bombardment operations against the home islands. Over the course of a month, eight battleships, a dozen cruisers, and numerous destroyers bombarded military and industrial targets in one of the last major operations of the Second World War.\n\nThis is original content based on research by The History Guy.

                    "description": "In this Video, We Analyse and uncover everything you want to know about the legendary consiglieri, Tom Hagen. Answering some of the Biggest Questions You Have....\nHow Did Tom Hagen Die? Why was Tom Hagen out? Did Michael Trust Tom?\n\nIn addition, if Michael Corleone & Tom Hagen were to go against each other, Who Would Win?\nTherefore we will analyse both characters in different categories to finally know who would Win?\n\nIn one of the initial scripts of the Godfather 3, Michael Corleone and Tom Hagen would go up against each other. Which begs the question, if Tom was to go up against Michael, who would win? Lets find out..\n\nOne of the most important individuals, who would be instrumental in maintaining the vast power of the Corleone family empire, was the legendary consiglieri, Tom Hagen.\nHe was made consiglieri to the most powerful mafia boss in the entire country. which obviously was Don Vito Corleone.\n After the passing of Vito\u2019s close childhood friend and former shrewd Consiglieri, Genco Abandando, in a move that was seen as controversial and even foolish, Vito named Tom Hagen as his new consiglieri.\nEven though the films didn\u2019t focus primarily on him,Tom was still an integral part of the Corleone family and played a key role in its success. he helped the empire grow to be worth billions, and held the secrets of the Corleone family as he was the dons right hand man, and was entrusted with almost everything.\n\nAfter the attempt on Michael's life at the compound, Michael appointed Tom as acting Don. Which came out quite a surprise to Tom , as this was a sign of deep trust. And so, Tom finally understood why Michael was distancing him from certain aspects of the family business. Michael explained that he had to exclude Tom from these aspects, so that he can with full certainty trust  him at that point.\nThis is because of the fact that since Tom didn't know certain things, he wouldn\u2019t be targeted or pressured to betray Michael especially since how high up tom was, he would be the person Michaels enemies would target to get to him.\nBut with Tom not having any no motive or information to make moves against him. Michael knew he could count on at least one person.\n\nHagen was instrumental in both securing the friendship of powerful Senator Patrick Geary and defending Michael as his lawyer during the Senate hearings on the Mafia.\n\nAfter Michael had taken care of all his enemies once again, there was still one last thread he needed taken care of by Tom. And so He was instructed by Michael to convince the almost traitor and former Capo regime Frank Pentangeli to, lets just say permanently stay silent once and for all, to protect Michael and the Family from his testimony forever. With Pentangeli and other enemies dead, the Corleone family as it regained its position as the most powerful crime family in the nation and now on its way into fulfilling Michaels long time vision.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 \ud835\udc09\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc14\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a @\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1a",
