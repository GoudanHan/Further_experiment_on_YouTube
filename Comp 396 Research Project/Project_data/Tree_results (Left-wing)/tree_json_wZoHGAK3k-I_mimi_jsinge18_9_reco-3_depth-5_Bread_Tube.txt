His book, The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great, is a New York Times bestseller.\n\nIn a spiky Politics Live interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Shapiro refers to an incident which took place between Trump campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski and Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields in 2016.\n\nAlthough a charge was brought at the time against Mr Lewandowski, Florida prosecutors dropped the case.\n\nThis is an unedited version of their interview, which was terminated by Mr Shapiro.",

Alexis\u2019 is above 160.\n\nThe doctors who tested Alexis said she tested so high, they couldn\u2019t even calculate her IQ score. They say she is smarter than 99.9% of the world.\n\nAlexis started reading when she was two-years-old.\n\n\u201cFrom 12-18 months old, we'd be driving around in the car and she would recite her bedtime story from the night before,\u201d said her Dad Ian. \u201cShe didn\u2019t just recite them, she recited them exactly.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just her 5th grade reading level that\u2019s shocking, Alexis also taught herself Spanish via her parents\u2019 iPad.\n\nAlexis\u2019 parents know their daughter\u2019s gift is amazing but they are also discovering new challenges.\n\n\u201cDoes she go into kindergarten early? We are kind of hesitant because we do want her to to get that social aspect,\u201d said Ian.\n\nAlexis will never be able to go to a normal school, according to the doctor who helped test her.\n\nOne of the reasons, often times, kids this brilliant have high anxiety and it's easier for  them to be around similar children.\n\n\u201cAnytime she learns a word and just picks it up through anything, she never ever uses it in the incorrect context, ever,\u201d said Ian.",
