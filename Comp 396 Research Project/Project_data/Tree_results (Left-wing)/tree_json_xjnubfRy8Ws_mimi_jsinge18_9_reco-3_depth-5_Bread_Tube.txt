And, good news, it's all actually pretty fascinating!!\n\nThe things I think you should check out include:\n\nThis Video I Made on Hankschannel (especially for US citizens)",

The Americans control the airport but the Taliban control access to it.\n\n\u201cSo, the Americans are trying to move heaven and earth to force the Taliban to allow people free access to that airport.\u201d",
