Here you will find songs with soothing warm pianos and delightful violin melodies. Some of the tracks contain sounds of nature such as rain, waterfalls, and the seashore waves that decrease stress and anxiety. It is proven that calming background music with sustained sounds improves focus and boosts motivation. During long studies or work sessions, our radio will aid your endurance. Neoclassical tracks are famous for minimizing distractions while white noise present in these tunes optimizes concentration, reduces the learning curve and working time, and improves creativity and clarity. \n\nFor best results keep our music in the background to accord both sides of the brain, prepare to seize this day, and as always, enjoy the music!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Image author and inspirator \n Micha\u0142 Karcz\n https://www.behance.net/gallery/64984...\n https://www.deviantart.com/karezoid\n https://500px.com/p/karezoid?view=photos\n https://www.michalkarcz.com/copy-of-home\n\n\nWe have created a new channel and we really need your help.\n \ud83d\ude4f Please like, comment or subscribe.\nGenre: Ambient,  Drone, Modern Classical, Contemporary classical music\nStyle: Downtempo, Spacey Ambient\nMood: Inspiring, Peaceful, Night, Smooth, Calming, Soothing, Space, Nature\nDuration: 24/7\nFeature: Without Lyrics, No vocals\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 Similar videos\nEnergy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nFuture Garage \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nMusic Genres \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAll Music VIdeos \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nWork Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillout Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nStudy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nHacker Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAmbient Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillstep Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n\n #AmbientMusicLive #DroneMusicBackground #ContemporaryClassicalMusic",

It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

Put your Guy Fawkes mask on and boost your coding performance with dynamic and futuristic chillstep beats!\nAll jokes aside, online anonymity is really important. \nAnd not just for those who are up to no good. It's important for all of us. \n\n1. Identity Protection. Sometimes you just don't want anyone to know who you really are. Even if you aren't involved in anything illegal or questionable. There's a level of social safety that comes with anonymity. \n\n2. Personal Harassment. Online harassment can manifest in many ways: when someone releases your personal information, intimate photos or videos of you on the internet without your knowledge. At best, it's a violation of privacy. At worst, it can obliterate your reputation, your future, and even your sanity.\n\n3. Sensitive Issues. There's one other major category of people who benefit from anonymity: those who need more information on a given topic but don't want to be caught seeking out that information. Most people actually fall into this group without realizing it.\n\nWhether we're avoiding cybercriminals, protecting ourselves from harassment, or dealing with a sensitive personal issue, we all benefit from being able to stay anonymous online.\n\nWe have created a new channel and we really need your help.\n \ud83d\ude4f Please like, comment or subscribe.\nGenre: Electronic music\nStyle: Downtempo, Chillstep, Future Garage\nMood: Inspiring, Smooth, Future, Cyber, Space, Dark\nDuration: 24/7\nFeature: Without Lyrics\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 Similar videos\nEnergy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nFuture Garage \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nMusic Genres \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAll Music VIdeos \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nWork Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillout Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nStudy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nHacker Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAmbient Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillstep Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n\n\n #MusicForCoding #ProgrammingPlaylist #MusicForConcentration",

What\u2019s more, is that LOONA created a bigger wave of change with their passion to make a world where not even a single girl is oppressed. \n\n[&] album is about why LOONA had no choice but to break the fixed rules and become one with all LOO\u03a0\u0394s around the world, after making bigger waves of change.\nLOONA holds a variety of symbolic objects that symbolize their dignity. Among those, the symbolic color has a significant connection with the message that LOONA wishes to convey through this album.\n\n\u201cAnd all LOO\u03a0\u0394s are one\u201d, all LOONAs in the world paint the world with their own colors and conveys the message that they will shout out \u201cPaint The Town\u201d in one voice after they found their own colors.\n\nFinally conquering the LOONAverse with their own strengths, LOONA then discovers a bigger world that they have never known about.\n\nThe intro \u2018&\u2019 holds a story about you, me, and us together (&) becoming one after breaking the fixed, conventional symbols.\n\nThe title track 'PTT (Paint The Town)' is a hip-hop dance genre with the most intense and explosive energy of LOONA that they have released so far. \n\n\u2018PTT (Paint The Town)' combines all the essential elements from chart-topping Bollywood songs, with a massive Indian drums and tablas combined with aggressive dubstep and 808 bass sounds, a hypnotic Indian flute playing the signature melody of the song and a massive chorus. The minimalist verses and building prechorus parts all lead to haunting chorus parts with a melody line you will never get out of your head.\n\nThis title track aims to establish and redefine themselves after breaking the rules without being trapped in taboos or being wary of others to \"Paint The Town\" in LOONA\u2019s colors.\n \n\u2018WOW\u2019 is a song with a bouncy, up-tempo and infectious beat. LOONA celebrates with the world all the women out there and encourages every girl to be strong and confident through this empowering song.\n\n'Be Honest' is a refreshing song with an upbeat tempo, telling you to be confident about your feelings and be honest just like the name of the song. \n\n\u2018Dance On My Own\u2019 is an emotional but high-paced energetic song that mixes the organic strums of affected acoustic guitar with hip hop drums. This song will both make you feel things as much as it will make you want to dance.\n\n\u2018Different Night\u2019 is a story of the girls who spend different nights at the same time. It\u2019s an emotional ballad song with a signature melody of a dreamy and sentimental pad and pluck sound.\n\nThe last track \u2018U R\u2019 is a Lofi R&B song with a sentimental piano and gentle electric guitar combined with LOONA\u2019s voice. It\u2019s about expressing love to the loved one who approached you like a heart-warming star and shined upon you.\n\nAfter being one, a hero comes into the world by LOONA.",
