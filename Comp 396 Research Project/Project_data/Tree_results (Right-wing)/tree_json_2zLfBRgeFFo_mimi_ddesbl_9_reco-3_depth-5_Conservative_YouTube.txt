At 19, she claimed to have invented a miniaturised machine that with a single drop of blood could map a person\u2019s health quickly, reliably and cheaply. She boasted that her technology meant serious diseases like cancer would be prevented before they happened. And it was not only a \u201cwow\u201d moment for patients.

But as Tara Brown reports, her invention was an invention \u2013 it simply didn\u2019t work. Elizabeth Holmes is no visionary. She\u2019s a cruel fraudster who has put people\u2019s lives at risk, and because of that, now faces 20 years in jail.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

His lecture, \"Education: For Whom and For What?\" featured a talk on the state of higher education, followed by a question-and-answer session. \n\nChomsky, an Institute Professor and a Professor Emeritus of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he worked for more than 50 years, has been concerned with a range of education-related issues in recent years. Among them: How do we characterize the contemporary state of the American education system? What happens to the quality of education when public universities become more privatized? Are public universities in danger of being converted into facilities that produce graduates-as-commodities for the job market? What is the role of activism in education? With unprecedented tuition increases and budget struggles occurring across American campuses, these are questions that are more relevant than ever.",

It has happened before.\n\nIn the 12th century BCE the great Bronze Age civilizations of the Mediterranean\u2014all of them\u2014suddenly fell apart.  Their empires evaporated, their cities emptied out, their technologies disappeared, and famine ruled.  Mycenae, Minos, Assyria, Hittites, Canaan, Cyprus\u2014all gone.  Even Egypt fell into a steep decline.  The Bronze Age was over.\n\nThe event should live in history as one of the great cautionary tales, but it hasn\u2019t because its causes were considered a mystery.  How can we know what to be cautious of?  Eric Cline has taken on on the mystery.  An archaeologist-historian at George Washington University, he is the author of \"1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed.\"  The failure, he suggests, was systemic.  The highly complex, richly interconnected system of the world tipped all at once into chaos.\n\n\"1177 B.C.: When Civilization Collapsed\" was given on January 11, 02016 as part of Long Now's Seminar series. The series was started in 02003 to build a compelling body of ideas about long-term thinking from some of the world's leading thinkers. The Seminars take place in San Francisco and are curated and hosted by Stewart Brand. To follow the talks, you can:\n\nSubscribe to our podcasts: ",

Pulitzer Prize\u00ad-winning reporter Chris Hedges takes Town Hall\u2019s stage for a provocative examination of America in crisis\u2014in the form of his book 'America: The Farewell Tour'. America, says Hedges, is convulsed by an array of pathologies that have arisen out of a profound malaise of hopelessness. These have resulted in an epidemic of diseases of despair and a civil society that has ceased to function. Hedges asserts that the opioid crisis, the rise of magical thinking, the celebration of sadism, and a host of other ills are the physical manifestations of a society ravaged by corporate pillage and a failed democracy. Join Hedges for a sobering discussion of the changing landscape of our country\u2014and a poignant cry from communities across America that seeks to jolt us out of complacency while there is still time.\n\nChris Hedges is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and former foreign correspondent for fifteen years for The New York Times where he served as the Middle East Bureau Chief and Balkan Bureau Chief. He previously worked overseas for The Dallas Morning News, The Christian Science Monitor, and NPR. He writes a weekly column for the online magazine Truthdig out of Los Angeles and is host of the Emmy Award\u00ad\u2013winning RT America show \u201cOn Contact.\u201d He is the author of the bestsellers American Fascists, Days of Destruction\u00ad, Days of Revolt, and was a National Book Critics Circle finalist for War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning.\n\nPresented by Town Hall Seattle and Seattle University.",

Ranging from banning federal employees\u2019 use of the phrase \u201cclimate change\u201d to making disparaging comments about African nations and countries such as Haiti and El Salvador, Press lists his reasons why he believes the president is unfit for office. Press says that Trump\u2019s calendar is marked with extensive \u201cexecutive time\u201d so he can tweet, golf and watch TV.\n\nBut, in a political climate where the world has learned to expect the unexpected, Press will also offer a twist: one reason not to ditch Donald Trump.\n\nwww.commonwealthclub.org/covid19support\n\n-Subscribe for more Videos: ",

                "description": "While Twitter feuds and Russian hackers dominate news headlines, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is radically changing the policies and programs that define the American way of life. In their first year, the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to defund Obamacare, repeal LGBT protections in the workplace, impose tax cuts and deport undocumented immigrants have significantly impacted millions of Americans, all while the mainstream media has struggled to keep up. Beyond the tweets, firings, scandals and indictments, how will Trump\u2019s policy agenda continue to affect our daily lives?\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston says he has the answers. Since 1988, Johnston has been chronicling Trump\u2019s personal life and business dealings\u2014from his casinos to his marriages and beyond. In his new book, It\u2019s Even Worse Than You Think, Johnston is going where the media won\u2019t\u2014into the weeds\u2014to shed new light on the Trump administration\u2019s policies and bureaucratic choices and how they will change America. Join Johnston for a revealing conversation about the Trump administration\u2019s impact on our finances, health care, safety and much, much more.\n\n-www.commonwealthclub.org/covid19support\n\n-Subscribe for more Videos: ",

                    "description": "Brief History of that other economic designed crash of 1929\nBBC documentary\n\nOn October 29, 1929, Black Tuesday hit Wall Street as investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors. In the aftermath of Black Tuesday, America and the rest of the industrialized world spiraled downward into the Great Depression (1929-39), the deepest and longest-lasting economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world up to that time.\n\n1929 Stock Market Crash\n\nDuring the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, after a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value. Among the other causes of the eventual market collapse were low wages, the proliferation of debt, a struggling agricultural sector and an excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated.\n\nStock prices began to decline in September and early October 1929, and on October 18 the fall began. Panic set in, and on October 24, Black Thursday, a record 12,894,650 shares were traded. Investment companies and leading bankers attempted to stabilize the market by buying up great blocks of stock, producing a moderate rally on Friday. On Monday, however, the storm broke anew, and the market went into free fall. Black Monday was followed by Black Tuesday (October 29), in which stock prices collapsed completely and 16,410,030 shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors, and stock tickers ran hours behind because the machinery could not handle the tremendous volume of trading.\n\n\n1929 Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression\n\nAfter October 29, 1929, stock prices had nowhere to go but up, so there was considerable recovery during succeeding weeks. Overall, however, prices continued to drop as the United States slumped into the Great Depression, and by 1932 stocks were worth only about 20 percent of their value in the summer of 1929. The stock market crash of 1929 was not the sole cause of the Great Depression, but it did act to accelerate the global economic collapse of which it was also a symptom. By 1933, nearly half of America\u2019s banks had failed, and unemployment was approaching 15 million people, or 30 percent of the workforce.",

A major financial institution, the Knights Templar managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Europe.

This was aired in 2014, taken from interviews from (1993 - 2008).\nAll clips/scenes from the show were removed due to copyright issues.\n\nSEINFELD is an American sitcom television series created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld. It aired on NBC from July 5, 1989, to May 14, 1998, over nine seasons and 180 episodes. The show stars Seinfeld as a fictionalized version of himself who is the main protagonist and focuses on his personal life with three of his friends \u2013 George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). Seinfeld is set mostly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City. It has been described as \"a show about nothing,\" often focusing on the minutiae of daily life.\n\nSeinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s. It was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993, Golden Globe Award for Best TV-Series (Comedy) in 1994 and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series in 1995, 1997 and 1998.[132][133][134][135] Apart from these, the show was also nominated for an Emmy award from 1992 to 1998 for Outstanding Comedy series, Golden Globe award from 1994 to 1998 for Best TV-Series (Comedy), and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series from 1995 to 1998.\nTV Guide named it the greatest TV show of all time in 2002 and in 2013, the magazine ranked it as the second-greatest TV show. A 2015 The Hollywood Reporter survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named Seinfeld as their #5 favorite show. (Wikipedia)\n\nSEINFELD stars Jerry Seinfeld as a stand-up comedian whose life in New York City is made even more chaotic by his quirky group of friends who join him in wrestling with life's most perplexing, yet often trivial questions. Often described as \"a show about nothing,\" Seinfeld mines the humor in life's mundane situations like waiting in line, searching for a lost item, or the trials and tribulations of dating. Co-starring are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Jerry's ex-girlfriend and current platonic pal, Elaine Benes; Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Jerry's neurotic hard-luck best friend; and Michael Richards as Jerry's eccentric neighbor, Kramer.\nSTARS:Jerry Seinfeld,  Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michael Richards, and Jason Alexander as George. (sonypictures.com)\n\n\nThe Charlie Rose Show (PBS/1991\u20132017) is an American television interview and talk show, with Charlie Rose as executive producer, executive editor, and host. The show was syndicated on PBS until 2017 and is owned by Charlie Rose, Inc.

Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, the cultural forces that make Asians so successful at math and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band. Gladwell is a staff writer for The New Yorker and the author of Blink and The Tipping Point.\n\nAbout the Giants of Science Series: This is not just for folks who got As in high school chemistry. The scientists are such good storytellers, their subjects so provocative and the conversation so easygoing that all you have to do is bring your mind (and a friend).

Utilizing case studies as diverse as speed dating, pop music, and the shooting of Amadou Diallo, Gladwell reveals that what we think of as decisions made in the blink of an eye are much more complicated than assumed. Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology, he shows how the difference between good decision-making and bad has nothing to do with how much information we can process quickly, but on the few particular details on which we focus. Gladwell reveals how we can become better decision makers -- in our homes, our offices, and in everyday life. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.",

His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss.

In this lecture DeepMind Research Scientist Wojciech Czarnecki will go through basics of how these models operate, learn and solve problems. He also introduces various terminology/naming conventions to prepare attendees for further, more advanced talks. Finally, he briefly touches upon more research oriented directions of neural network design and development.\n\nDownload the slides here: ",

                    "description": "From about 1500 BC to 1200 BC, the Mediterranean region played host to a complex cosmopolitan and globalized world-system. It may have been this very internationalism that contributed to the apocalyptic disaster that ended the Bronze Age. When the end came, the civilized and international world of the Mediterranean regions came to a dramatic halt in a vast area stretching from Greece and Italy in the west to Egypt, Canaan, and Mesopotamia in the east. Large empires and small kingdoms collapsed rapidly. With their end came the world\u2019s first recorded Dark Ages. It was not until centuries later that a new cultural renaissance emerged in Greece and the other affected areas, setting the stage for the evolution of Western society as we know it today.  Professor Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University will explore why the Bronze Age came to an end and whether the collapse of those ancient civilizations might hold some warnings for our current society.\n\nConsidered for a Pulitzer Prize for his recent book 1177 BC, Dr. Eric H. Cline is Professor of Classics and Anthropology and the current Director of the Capitol Archaeological Institute at The George Washington University. He is a National Geographic Explorer, a Fulbright scholar, an NEH Public Scholar, and an award-winning teacher and author. He has degrees in archaeology and ancient history from Dartmouth, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania; in May 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree (honoris causa) from Muhlenberg College.  Dr. Cline is an active field archaeologist with 30 seasons of excavation and survey experience.\n\nThe views expressed in this video are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Capital Area Skeptics.",

Dangerous places in the Andes are often given names such as \"Death Bend\" or \"Jinxed Bend\u201d, marking the spot where people have died. On the high plateau of the Andes, we find vicu\u00f1as, a type of lama, which produce the most expensive wool in the world. However, a parasite has recently decimated vicu\u00f1a stocks, attacking the animals\u2019 skin, leaving them unable to cope with the cold and rain. The western slopes of the Andes are dusty and dry. These mark the start of the Peruvian coastal desert, where the Nazca culture developed over 2,000 years ago. All that remains now are the famous Nazca Lines, enormous geoglyphs etched into the hard floor of the desert. The road then turns north along the Pacific coast, where there are numerous fishing villages. One of them is Pisco, where the local fishing trade has been badly hit by the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. And then finally, after 144 hours and 6,300 kilometers on the bus, we arrive in Lima - just two days late.\n\nWatch the other parts of the journey:\nPart 1: ",

Its hallmarks were extensive light, glass, pointed arches and diagonal ribs, and it ushered in what is known as the Gothic period.\n\n\"Let there be light!\" - the biblical message emanates from the Basilica of Saint-Denis. Its Gothic building principles spurred medieval architects to ever more daring constructions. Rooms would be flooded with more and more light, buildings would rise higher and higher into the heavens. In the following 100 years, more than 20 large Gothic churches were built in the Paris region. And it barely took a generation for the trend to take hold elsewhere in Europe. A contest of cathedrals saw Freiburg, Strasbourg and Ulm build the largest churches of their time. It was not only nobles and bishops who saw in these splendid buildings a chance to enhance their reputation and power; the period also presented ideal opportunities to a social group that only emerged in the 12th Century: the middle classes.\n\nPart 1: ",

It\u2019s possible: Research shows that roots have the potential to provide food for the world's population, stop climate change and help extract resources in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nPlants must withstand periods of drought and heat, as well as flooding, and they use their roots to do this. Roots also help them actively search for nutrients in the soil, while warding off dangers such as pathogens and toxins. Now, scientists at the research institute Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich are investigating root growth using high-tech methods. The goal is to breed stress-resistant seeds for plants with robust roots. They are not alone: In Sweden, Professor Linda Maria M\u00e5rtensson is conducting research on a perennial wheat variety that will ensure higher yields while protecting the soil.\n\nAlong the world's coasts, too, roots are a lifesaver. Coastal ecologist Professor Tjeerd Bouma has discovered that if special grasses are planted in front of dikes, they create a salt marsh that acts as a natural breakwater.\n\nMeanwhile, geochemist Dr. Oliver Wiche of the Technical University of Freiberg is researching something known as \"phytomining.\" He wants to know which plants are best suited for mining metals from the soil. Could this root research give rise to a new, environmentally friendly branch of industry?\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?\n\nFind out more: ",
