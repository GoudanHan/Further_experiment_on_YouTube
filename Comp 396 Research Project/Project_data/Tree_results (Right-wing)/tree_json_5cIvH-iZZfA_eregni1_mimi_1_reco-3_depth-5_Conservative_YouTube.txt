We are traveling from Hyangsan, three hours north of Pyongyang back to the capital but the main road and the sanctioned route has been flooded. This is the only way back.\n\nBuildings are in disrepair, some barely look inhabitable.\n\nResidents of this small town walk or sit by the side of the road, many seeming to have little to do. A number of official-looking men dressed in brown Mao suits stand silently on street corners. It is impossible to know who they are or which element of the party or military they might work for but they clearly seem to be observing.\n\nDespite the driver traveling as quickly as possible through these inhabited areas, you could still sense the local community being monitored.\n\nDozens of men are working on the outskirts of town, building a stone wall between their crops and the swollen river.\n\nBoulders and stones are carried by hand and stacked without adhesive. This intensive labor force is seen repeatedly in the North Korean countryside, but I see no heavy equipment to help building or farming.\n\nOne man trims hedges with a rusty scythe, other men repair part of the pavement with small hand held pick axes.\n\nCars are rare, most people either walk or cycle.",

SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB\n\nAs the Athletic Director and head coach of the Varsity Soccer team at Ryerson University, Dr. Joseph is often asked what skills he is searching for as a recruiter: is it speed? Strength? Agility? In Dr. Joseph's TEDx Talk, he explores self confidence and how it is not just the most important skill in athletics, but in our lives.\n \nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

                    "description": "We need a plan of action for tomorrow. Generation Z is not at fault for their failures. Nate Turner explains accountability from all other generations.  Nathaniel A. Turner was born and raised in Gary, Indiana.  Despite graduating in the bottom quarter of his high school class from one of the worst and most impoverished school systems in the country, Nate went on to earn several degrees.  Nate holds a Bachelors (Accounting), a Masters (Theology & History), and a Juris Doctorate degree.\nNate is an entrepreneur and has operated a financial services practice for two decades.  Not withstanding his professional accomplishments, Nate's greatest passion is helping children realize what he rarely experienced growing up in Gary: feeling valued as a human being and knowing his life had a purpose.Today, Nate's counsel and advice are included on his blog \"The Raising Supaman Project\", his radio show \"The Road Less Traveled\", and in his books \"Raising Supaman\" and \"Stop The Bus\".  Nate encourages parents, guardians, and the community to raise children to become great world citizens and he challenges us all to maximize our abilities to their fullest potential.  Nate also speaks nationally and contributes to other nationally recognized blogs, publications, and radio programs.Nate believes each day is another opportunity to share valuable experiences, tools, methods, and resources with those charged with preparing the sons and daughters of our Nation.  Nate considers it a calling to make certain that OUR future is ready for this awesome journey called life.

His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.\n\nDaryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley\u2019s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.\n\nIn 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.\n\nSince his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a \u201ccertificate of friendship\u201d from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He\u2019s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly\u2019s granddaughter.\n\nDavis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations. He is also an actor with stage and screen credits, appearing in the critically acclaimed HBO police drama, The Wire, and most recently, as the subject of the documentary Accidental Courtesy, which filmed his real life encounters with Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leaders as he helps to dismantle racism across the United States\n\n Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations.

                "description": "Attorney Marilyn York owns a Men\u2019s Rights Family Law Firm in Reno Nevada, established in 2001. She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP.

And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020. \n\n\nArtist:                   Secret Garden\nAlbum:                Earthsongs\nTrack:                   Lotus\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB\n\nJust before his passing on January 10, 2014, Sam Berns was a Junior at Foxboro High School in Foxboro, Massachusetts, where he achieved highest honors and was a percussion section leader in the high school marching band. He also achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. Sam was diagnosed with Progeria, a rare, rapid aging disease, at the age of 2.

He believes that we all benefit from increasing the everyday possibilities to articulate those feelings that are far too often left internalised. Don\u2019t miss this incredibly personal talk in which Gareth shares his story of his battle with depression during his time as an undergraduate student, how he found the space to talk, and how he recovered from this low point through helping others to find that space too. You can continue the conversation with him on Twitter: @Garethjgriffith Gareth Griffith is an Advanced Quantitative Methods PhD student at the University of Bristol. He is interested in all things Mental Health, Wellbeing, Quantitative Methods and Social Inequality. His research focuses on using advanced statistical methodologies to address inequality in mental health outcomes in the UK, particularly investigating the most effective way to measure and analyse these outcomes. Currently he is working on evaluating the current methodologies and underlying assumptions used in measuring and quantifying mental health responses in the UK. His previous projects include using developing advanced multilevel methodologies to investigate segregation in UK self-rated health, and multilevel analysis of mental health outcomes across the UK in 2009.

Documentary Filmmaker, The Red Pill \n\nCassie Jaye founded Jaye Bird Productions in 2008, which has since produced a  collection  of documentary films that have been praised for being thought-provoking, entertaining and respectful in representing multiple competing views within each film. Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye\u2019s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.",
