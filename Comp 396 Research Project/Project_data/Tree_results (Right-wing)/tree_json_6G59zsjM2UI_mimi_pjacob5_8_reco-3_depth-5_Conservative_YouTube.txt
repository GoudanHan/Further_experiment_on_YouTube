To cover up his many crimes, the one-time Hollywood heavyweight had at his disposal a so-called \u201carmy of spies\u201d. These \u201cagents\u201d collected sensitive and embarrassing information about his victims, which was then used to discredit or shut them up. Among Weinstein\u2019s trusted allies was Australian Dylan Howard, who a few days ago went to court to try to stop his part in Bartlett\u2019s story being broadcast. Unfortunately for Howard, he failed. Subscribe here: ",

It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen\u2019s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She\u2019s accused of being Epstein\u2019s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

Scroll down for program details.\n\n5:30 pm MDT.  (7:30 pm EDT)\n\nDuration of each group below: Approximately 45 minutes \n\nProgram: Martin Daigle\nGlenn Kotche - Mobile\nMartin Daigle - Computer Music\nSylvain Pohu - Beat\nCasey Cangelosi - Fanatic\nAndy Akiho - Stop Speaking\n\nThis multimedia concert was created for the digital world \u2013including repertoire that takes full advantage of digital music as a tool. Whether you are on your phone or computer, this concert was designed to reach you even if you don\u2019t have access to a home theater. This concert is not possible in a concert hall or a jazz bar because each piece is performed outside it\u2019s \u201cintended\u201d setting. Instead of the traditional setting, I decided to perform pieces in a variety of common and public places.\nWith the blessing from each composer, and the help of technology, tune or dial in for an out of context classical percussion recital.\n\nProgram: Bella Duo\nCeclie Chaminade - l\u2019Ondine (arr. Bella Duo)\nCarl Reinecke - Sonata in E minor for Flute and Piano, Op.167, \u201cUndine\u201d\nAlan Menken - Part of Your World from \"The Little Mermaid\" (arr. Kyle Landry and Bella Duo)\nTradition Irish, arr. Mark Armstrong, Bella Duo - An Mhaigdean Mhara\nJoe Hisaishi, arr. arr.  Guillaume Masson and Bella Duo - Deep Sea Ranch from \"Ponyo on the Cliff\"\n\nThrough the mythology of many cultures around the world, people explore the depth of their desire through stories of water spirits that share a common theme:  dreams and desires, and the great sacrifices that they demand. Combining the concept of audiobooks, miniseries, and classical concerts, four water spirits stories will be presented, both in music and in words.\n\nProgram: oNSET\nUrsula Mamlok - Sonar Trajectory\nEmmalie Tello - Emmalie\u2019s Trajectory\nTimothy Peterson - Duet for Body Percussion\nTeagan Faran - Teagan\u2019s Trajectory\nTeagan Faran - Taiwan\nTeagan Faran - Transit Meditation\nNicole Brancato - Nicole\u2019s Trajectory\nNicole Brancato - 2063\nSteph Dressler - Steph\u2019s Trajectory\nDiego Schissi, arr. Teagan Faran - Tanguera\nEmmalie Tello - Through Glass\n*dedicated to Carole Perricone\noNSET \u2013 Autonomous\n\nAutonomous tells the story of strangers crossing paths on the subway. Defined by our individual reimaginings of Ursula Mamlok\u2019s Sonar Trajectory, we explore the relationship between human isolation and connection.  Are you autonomous? Certainly you are not alone\u2026\nJoin the oNSET WhatsApp experience using this form. \n\nWith support from: \nBella Duo - In partnership with University of Toronto Faculty of Music\noNSET - This concert was made possible with support from the Dwight and Ursula Mamlok Foundation and Dr. Reiko F\u00fcting.

Every minute of every day, governments, institutions and companies, many in Australia, fight for survival in combat against cyber criminals. The enemy is not only evil, but also extremely clever in attempting to extort money from often unsuspecting organisations. Stealth is one of the hackers\u2019 most potent weapons, enabling maximum mayhem and catastrophic damage. Three months ago, NINE, Australia\u2019s largest locally owned broadcasting and publishing company, was attacked. On 60 MINUTES, Tara Brown reports from the frontline of this extraordinary cyber battle: a sinister infiltration that led to an incredible fightback which tested the best technical minds in the country.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

In this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Moran explains the brain science of how self-narrative determines our reality.\n\nMoran is a fascinating blend of a wide variety of disciplines, and this diversity has led him to explore some promising, albeit nontraditional ways of investigating the brain, namely cracking open the skull and peering inside whilst the person is still living. His discoveries have made him a much sought after speaker and leading thinker who's influencing academia and business in equal measure. His innovative theories about the brain have been published in Nature, the highest-ranking journal in the world, and he consults regularly for hit shows such as Mr. Robot and Limitless.\n\nHis education is a wondrous grab bag of joy and includes a PhD in neuroscience from Caltech and both an MA in philosophy and a BSc in physics from Tel Aviv University. He's a visiting faculty member at MIT's Media Lab, and was named one of the 40 leading professors under 40.\n\nMoran is the Alfred P. Sloan professor at the American Film Institute where he teaches a screenwriting course on science and film. He holds multiple patents and is a multi-timed national storytelling champion whose talks have garnered him millions of views. He is the professor of neuroscience and business at the Kellogg School of Management and the neuroscience program at the Northwestern university.\n\nIn this episode, Moran and Tom investigate the hidden powers of the brain and how they can be harnessed to achieve greatness.\n\nSHOW NOTES\n\n[",
