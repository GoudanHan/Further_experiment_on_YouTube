Neil talks about learning to drive and why he loves driving at night while he chauffeurs you through the streets of Manhattan. And even though we never get to the Hayden Planetarium, where else in the world can you sit in the passenger seat and turn around to see Neil and the two Chucks talking about shooting deer with paintballs and reducing deer-induced traffic fatalities by introducing mountain lions into the local environment. \n\nNOTE: This 360 video is best experienced with headphones on a mobile device or a Virtual Reality headset.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: ",
