However, he's also bringing an auteur sensibility to the new Apple TV+ series premiering today, as not just the star but the creator, co-writer, and director of eight of the 10 episodes.\n\nMr. Corman features Gordon-Levitt as a teacher living in Los Angeles, struggling to cope with anxiety and other issues with the help of his roommate Victor (Arturo Castro) and mother Ruth (Debra Winger). It's an intimate character study set in contemporary times \u2014 so contemporary, in fact, that Season 1 was rewritten to accommodate the pandemic, which shut down the original production and shifted the story to some degree... though, as Gordon-Levitt revealed during a one-on-one interview, not as much as you might have expected.\n\nIn the transcript below and the video above, Gordon-Levitt explains how the pandemic altered the series, why it meant a lot to him to involve Debra Winger in the series, and why he looked to Aurora Guerrero (Queen Sugar, Little America) to direct the two episodes he didn't direct himself. But first, we get into the why of it all.",

                "description": "With Don\u2019t Breathe 2 arriving in theaters August 13th, I recently spoke to Stephen Lang about making the Rodo Sayagues\u2019 helmed sequel. While most of our conversation was about Don't Breathe, towards the end of the interview, we talked about James Cameron, the Avatar sequels, and Avatar 5. If you\u2019re not aware, Cameron has previously announced that Lang is the villain in all four sequels.\n\nSince I knew he wasn\u2019t going to tell me anything that would spoil the storyline or plot, I decided to ask his reaction to reading the scripts and how Cameron was using technology to help make the sequels. Regarding his reaction after reading the scripts, Lang told me:\n\n    \u201cWhen I finished the last script, I was weeping. I just thought it was so beautiful. Yeah, the final script because he's telling a great, great story, an original story, a beautiful, beautiful story, and I was just incredibly moved by it. I hope and I trust and believe that audiences will be, too, because one of the things that he does really, really well is he moves it from the page to the stage in a way that that is very literal. You know what I mean? You really see it. What you read is what you get from him, I think, and more.\u201d\n\nWhile he wouldn\u2019t reveal what scene was being shot, Lang talked about the way Cameron is using technology and how he is always the smartest guy in the room:\n\n    \u201cHe's definitely pushing it big time on this one. I'm not giving away any trade secrets to say that, but I remember working on a sequence with him, there was an issue of scale going on. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. And it was defeating. It took and brought everything to kind of a halt. There was a problem that no one else recognized except him at the moment. So he had to come up with a solution. Anyway, we basically shut down or started working on something else. The next day, he came to me kind of really excited and said, 'I figured out the algorithm to do this.' He stared this algorithm and I'm looking at him thinking, 'What the hell are you talking about? I have no idea what you're talking about.' But he did. He created a problem ... there was a problem because he wanted a scene, something to happen, and then he solved it. He's been doing that for his entire career. And it's pretty cool, pretty amazing.\u201d",

Rapid vaccination during an epidemic is part of epidemic control. And it's what every other country has done with COVID-19 ... Restrictions plus rapid vaccines works\".\n\n\"I think that's actually something that's really healthy because the fear and the ignorance in the community surrounding this virus 18 months into the pandemic is pretty disturbing,\" Ms Panahi said.",
