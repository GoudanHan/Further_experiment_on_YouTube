The world in such stories is a place of action, not a place of things, and it has its archetypal characters, positive and negative. Culture is typically represented as paternal, nature as maternal, and the individual as hero and adversary. Culture offers people security, but threatens them with tyranny. Nature offers renewal, but also brings death. The religious path of meaning allows people to negotiate this archetypal landscape. \n\nPodcast link: ",

He has written numerous soundtrack scores for acclaimed movies such as \u201cThe Puppetmaster\u201d (1993) and \u201cMarch of Happiness\u201d (1999), and have composed popular folks songs like \u201cDrift to Tamsui\u201d (1997) that earned him a Golden Melody Award in Best Composer category.\n\nChen Mingchang\u2019s musical expression is deeply rooted in his feelings towards his homeland, Taiwan and the cultural givings of this land. He skillfully assimilates the singing styles and melodies of \u201cnanguan\u201d and \u201cbeiguan\u201d, the spoken narration and nuance of the Taiwanese folk opera and traditional Taiwanese glove puppetry, and the chords of traditional folk music, altogether creating a new form of music onto modern song structures. It is perhaps inadequate to classify Chen\u2019s musical style simply as \u201cNew Taiwanese Song\u201d or \u201cmodern Taiwanese music\u201d, rather, its an entirely new music genre.\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

With light vim and pure talent, he demonstrates his unique playing style, which is notably a development of the Travis picking technique and blending of rhythm and melody. \n\nIn his career, he's played on recordings for Air Supply and Men at Work and in his twenties he joined one of Australia's biggest rock acts, Dragon. Now, as a two-time Grammy nominee with a career spanning five decades, he has, for several years, performed over 300 concerts annually. He's worked with Martin Taylor on a jazz-inspired duet album The Colonel and the Governor. His most recent original material is Little By Little (2011).\n\nConnect with Tommy:\nTw: ",

SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB\n\nJust before his passing on January 10, 2014, Sam Berns was a Junior at Foxboro High School in Foxboro, Massachusetts, where he achieved highest honors and was a percussion section leader in the high school marching band. He also achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. Sam was diagnosed with Progeria, a rare, rapid aging disease, at the age of 2. He is featured in the Emmy award-winning documentary Life According to Sam, which premiered on HBO on October 21, 2013, 2 days before his 17th birthday.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020. \n\n\nArtist:                   Secret Garden\nAlbum:                Earthsongs\nTrack:                   Lotus\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Some define him as an expert institutional investor, while others know him as a large scale installation artist, avid outdoorsman, professor, decision strategist, coach, business leader, mindfulness extremist, author, speaker, daredevil or Guinness world record holder. In his talk, Stephen explains that what truly defines him aren't titles, but an approach to decision making that transformed him from someone who struggled with simple tasks to a guy who is continuously achieving even his most ambitious dreams.\n\nFor thirty years, he has applied cognitive science to investing, business and life. The result has been the turnaround of numerous institutional businesses, career best returns for managers who have adopted his methods, the development of a $1.25 billion dollar hedge fund and a rapidly shrinking bucket list.\nMr. Duneier teaches graduate courses on Decision Analysis in UCSB\u2019s College of Engineering. His book, AlphaBrain is due for release in early 2017 from Wiley & Sons.\nThrough Bija Advisors, he helps business leaders improve performance by applying proven, proprietary decision-making methods to their own processes.\nHis artwork has been featured around the world and is represented by the Sullivan Goss Gallery. As Commissioner of the League of Professional Educators, Duneier is using cognitive science to alter the landscape of American education. He is the former Head of Currency Option Trading at Bank of America and Emerging Markets at AIG International.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Such circumstances can make us feel crazy. How do we get around it? Movement pattern analysis. Each of us has a fingerprint. Those who understand the system can tell a great deal about people by watching them move. But we can also use it. As Driver tells us, whenever something is driving her nuts, she now wiggles. It is a movement from early childhood, and one CANNOT be angry when one is wiggling. This, she tells us, can save you headaches, and more importantly, friends.\n\nJanine Driver\u2019s mission is to INSPIRE people to look at their world in a different way. Janine is the New York Times Best Selling author of You Say More Than You Think, and more recently You Can\u2019t Lie To Me, award-winning keynote speaker, and body language expert for NBC\u2019s TODAY Show. Janine is the CEO and founder of the Body Language Institute and the elite division called the Decision Profiling Group.\nJanine and the Body Language Institute have helped Fortune 500 clients become examples of the total leader, which ultimately led them to win millions of dollars in new business contracts.\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

How do you know if It\u2019s the right time?  The answer is that you don\u2019t need to wait for some cataclysmic event, some psychic wake-up call.  You can create a massive change in your career, results and life at any time \u2013 if you ask yourself (and answer honestly) some big questions.\n\nMindy Gibbins-Klein has been a speaker and trainer for 28 years.  A Fellow of the PSA and even a past Regional President, she is well known and respected in the UK business community.  A picture of success, many would say.  But the past several years have thrown huge boulders in her path, causing her to doubt everything she had built over the years, including some important relationships.  Clawing her way back up, Mindy challenged herself to find the gift in her situation and finally shift herself and her career.  The result is nothing short of extraordinary: spectacular success in her business and deep clarity and fulfilment as a person.  For the first time ever, Mindy is sharing with us the secrets of her transformation and a method for you to create your own transformation.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Dr. Crum says the biggest game changer is \u201cYOU, by harnessing the power of your mind.\" She explores scientific results that show the influence of the mindset on the body, and how changing the subjective mindset produced different outcomes. Dr. Crum's work is inspired in part by the placebo effect, and has implications that stretch far beyond the realm of medicine.\n\nDr. Crum is a professor, psychologist, and researcher investigating how mindsets affect health and behavior. \n\nDr. Crum's research focuses on how changes in subjective mindsets\u2014the lenses through which information is perceived, organized, and interpreted\u2014can alter objective reality through behavioral, psychological, and physiological mechanisms. Her work is, in part, inspired by research on the placebo effect, a notable and consistent demonstration of the ability of the mindset to elicit healing properties in the body. She is interested in understanding how mindsets affect important outcomes outside the realm of medicine, in the domains of behavioral health and organizational behavior.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

                    "description": "\"Imagine a world where you look someone in the eye, shake their hand, commit to a deal, and get exactly what you asked for with or without a contract. That is the world many of us want to see. In order for us to realize this world, we must first take a look at the state of the world we\u2019re in right now. \n\nHumanity over the last couple of decades has taken a negative trajectory and continues to get worse. Those who are dubious far outweigh those who are credible. This is proven by credibility research and a credibility survey that is presented in this talk.\n\nWhen you piece together the information from the credibility survey, the credibility research, and how you perceive the world today, you\u2019ll probably come to the same conclusion that Global Credibility Expert Mitchell Levy had:\n\n*** \u201cWe are losing our humanity.\u201d ***\n\nIt\u2019s not too late. We can still bring back our humanity. The redefinition of the word \u201ccredibility\u201d is the answer.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Dictionary, credibility is \u201cthe quality that somebody has that makes people believe or trust them.\u201d\n\nAfter having interviewed more than 500 thought leaders on credibility, Global Credibility Expert Mitchell Levy noticed that the definition of credibility in the Oxford Dictionary was only one-third accurate.\n\nThe updated definition of credibility is now \u201cthe quality of being known, being likable, and being trustworthy.\u201d\n\nIn this talk, Mitchell Levy discusses the three pillars of credibility, which are \u201cbeing known, being likable, and being trustworthy,\u201d as well as their components. He also discusses three ways you can be more credible today.\n\nThe purpose of this TEDtalk is to educate the public on what credibility is and how we can achieve it. When we educate ourselves and others on credibility, we can create a better world for ourselves, our families, and our communities, one where those who are credible greatly outnumber those who are dubious. We can create a better future for the generations to come.\n\nCredibility is not just a word; it\u2019s a way of living. It\u2019s a way to show up in life. Are you credible or are you dubious? We need to take action and live our lives credibly. Let\u2019s start now.\n\" Global Credibility Expert, Mitchell Levy, is a human whose purpose in life is to serve those who want to be seen as credible and win the war against those in Dubious Nation. \n\nMitchell has interviewed over 500 thought leaders from across the world on their credibility. This led him to uncover amazing insights on what credibility really is and why it\u2019s important in today\u2019s world, making him the go-to expert on credibility.\n\nMitchell has been a Silicon-Valley based Thought Leadership Evangelist for 25 years, has been chairman of the board of a NASDAQ-listed company, and is a TEDx/Commencement speaker. He is also an International bestselling author of over 60 books and has created twenty businesses in Silicon Valley including four publishing companies that have published over 750 books. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

A great conversation requires a balance between talking and listening. This balance is important because bad communication leads to bad relationships, at home, at work, everywhere.\n\nCeleste Headlee has worked in public radio since 1999, as a reporter, host, and correspondent. She was the Midwest Correspondent for NPR before becoming the co-host of the PRI show The Takeaway. She also guest hosted a number of NPR shows including Tell Me More, Talk of the Nation, Weekend All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition. \n \nCeleste holds multiple degrees in music and still performs as a professional opera singer.
