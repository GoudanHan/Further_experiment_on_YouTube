What would it mean for our schools and classrooms if we showed up for tough, honest conversations about what it takes to bring our best, most authentic selves to work? These conversations may sound risky and vulnerable, but risk and vulnerability are essential to courageous schools. A daring classroom is a place where both teachers and students commit to choosing courage over comfort, choosing what is right over what is fun, fast or easy and practicing values rather than professing them.\n\nAbout SXSW EDU\nThe SXSW EDU\u00ae Conference & Festival fosters and celebrates innovations in learning by hosting a diverse and energetic community of stakeholders across a variety of backgrounds in education.

                    "description": "The tools and practice of valuation is intimidating to most laymen, who assume that they do not have the skills and the capability to value companies. In this talk, I propose to lay out four simple propositions about valuation. The first is that valuation is not an extension of accounting, insofar as it is not about recording the past but forecasting the future. The second is that valuation is not just modeling, where people put numbers into Excel spreadsheets and pump out values. A good valuation requires a narrative that binds the numbers together. The third is that valuing an asset or business is very different from pricing that asset or business, a difference that is often blurred in practice. The fourth is that luck plays a disproportionate role in whether you make money off your valuations. Put differently, you can do everything right and still walk away with nothing or worse at the end.\n\nAbout the Author\nI view myself, first and foremost, as a teacher. I do teach valuation and corporate finance not only to MBAs at Stern but to anyone who will listen (on iTunes U, online and on YouTube). I love to write books, teaching material and blog posts. After 30 years of teaching finance, I still find it fascinating as an interplay of economics, psychology and number crunching.",

Along with the acoustic guitar that plays throughout the song, V's humming and the harmonious sound of the violin in the latter part of the song truly stand out. Like the title \"Sweet Night\" suggests, it is a comforting track that wishes to gift the character, Park Sae Roy, who has had countless painful nights, only sweet nights in the future.\n\nV has been continually showcasing his musical talent through songs like \"4 O'CLOCK\", \"Scenery\" and \"Winter Bear\".\n\nReview from V (BTS)\nI first knew about \"ITAEWON CLASS\" through the webtoon years ago, and I remember having fun reading it while also learning valuable lessons. In particular, I really liked the character, Park Sae Roy, who left a deep impression on me, and I was very happy to see one of my favorite and close hyung playing this character. I am very thankful to be able to participate in this wonderful drama with my self-composed song. I hope many people will show this song lots of love.",
