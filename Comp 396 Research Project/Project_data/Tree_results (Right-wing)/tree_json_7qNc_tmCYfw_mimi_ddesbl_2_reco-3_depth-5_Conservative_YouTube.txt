With over 33 years combating radical extremist terrorism, Nance is known for championing human rights, ethical responsibility and cultural awareness in intelligence practices.\n\nIn his newest book, The Plot to Betray America: How Team Trump Embraced Our Enemies, Compromised Our Security, and How We Can Fix It, Nance argues that President Trump and his team have conspired to commit the greatest act of treason in the history of the United States: betrayal of the oath of office for personal gain. \n\nThe Plot to Betray America contains in-depth interviews with insiders, analysis from intelligence experts, and substantial evidence of Trump\u2019s deep financial ties to Russia. It also provides solutions on how to protect America\u2019s compromised security. Join us for an essential conversation with intelligence and counterterrorism expert Malcolm Nance as he explains how we can still save America\u2019s democracy, security and future.\n\n\ud83d\udcafSUBSCRIBE for more VIDEOS: ",

Separately, despite lower-than-predicted growth, China is still growing substantially and is set to become the world\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nBut the economic boom has been paired with an increase in state surveillance and crackdowns on dissent, as well as the repression of the Muslim Uighur minority. So at what cost has China\u2019s economic miracle come? And what\u2019s the future for civil liberties of the Chinese people?\n\nIn recent years China has also increased its military spending while some Chinese officials have been ratcheting up their militaristic rhetoric, raising fears of direct military confrontation with the United States.\n\nOn this Head to Head episode filmed at the Oxford Union, we challenge Charles Liu on all these topics, ask him whether the Chinese economy has hit a wall, and whether China\u2019s neighbours should dismiss their fears as his country builds up its military and extends its global reach.\n\nWe are joined by a panel of three experts:\n\nAndreas Fulda - China Specialist at Asia Research Institute and Assistant Professor at the School of Politics and International Relations, University of Nottingham.  \n\nVictor Gao - Vice President of the Beijing based Center for China and Globalization and former interpreter for the late President Deng Xiaoping.\n\nSteve Tsang - Professor and Director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) University of London.\n\nFollow us on Facebook (",

It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

Once funded, businesses will have six months to conduct a Phase I feasibility study at funding levels up to $150,000.  They can then move into Phase II prototyping and testing for two years at levels up to $1 million. Businesses can then convert the funded research project into new commercial products and technologies without giving up equity or paying interest on a business loan.\n\nThe Advanced Manufacturing Partnership of Southern California (AMP SoCal), led by the Price School \u2013 USC Center for Economic Development,  offered a free workshop for business owners who wanted to learn how to write successful proposals to any of the 11 government agencies that run these SBIR/STTR programs.  The presentation was delivered by Dr. Marie Talnack, an SBIR/STTR program expert with over 30 years of experience in writing and submitting successful grants and proposals.  Attendees learned the basics of the program, how the program makes sense for their respective company and the details of how to write a competitive proposal for funding.\n\nThe USC Center for Economic Development (CED) serves as a leader in facilitating sustainable economic development opportunities throughout Southern and Central California. A research center of the USC Price School of Public Policy, CED partners with community-based organizations, public agencies, and private entities to enhance their functional capacity by tapping the energy, enthusiasm, and talent of the school\u2019s faculty, staff, and students.",

And we all know a company is only as good as its team, which is why the hiring process is so critical as you start up your venture. Furthermore, anyone who has made a bad hire along the way (as most of us have) knows that hiring the wrong person can cost you far more than time and money. It ultimately makes the difference between market leaders and market laggards - or worse still - failed ventures entirely. Yet, every startup struggles to find the so called \"A+ players\" to build their business. In this session we define what A+ really means and share some tools on how to go after that talent.\n\niRobot's Senior Vice President of HR, Russ Campanello, and Acquia's Global Manager of Talent Acquisition, Eric Gaffen, will talk about the importance of hiring and team building at their companies.  In addition, watch as audience members participate in mock interviews and share the results of their experience.  \n\nLearn more about the Harvard Innovation Lab at ",

                    "description": "Dr. Jason Fung, MD, is a nephrologist and expert in the use of intermittent fasting and low-carbohydrate diets for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. In this presentation, delivered on Aug. 2, 2018, at the 2018 CrossFit Health Conference in Madison, Wisconsin, Fung shares his first-hand experiences with \u201cThe Mess\u201d and discusses how he shifted his research and medical practices as a result of those experiences.\n\nFung\u2019s objectives for his presentation include:\n1. Understanding why long-term weight loss is so difficult.\n2. Introducing the concept of therapeutic fasting.\n3. Understanding some myths and misunderstandings associated with the fasting process.\n\nHe recalls treating obese and diabetic patients with traditional methods, which included what he characterizes as poor dietary recommendations and a slurry of drugs. He explains, \u201cIt became obvious that I\u2019m just sort of holding their hand until they get their heart attack, until they get dialysis, until they go blind, until we chop their feet off.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really sad to realize that the profession that you\u2019ve chosen is not really helping people,\u201d he says. This realization compelled him to diagnose the problems associated with traditional care and seek alternative treatment methods for his patients.\n\nFung historicizes what he calls \u201cthe modern eating pattern,\u201d which emerged in 1977 in the U.S. with the development of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. He notes the 1977 guidelines led to the consumption of more grains and sugars, which in turn led to people \u201ceating often, eating late, and eating all the time.\u201d \n\nIncidences of obesity and Type 2 diabetes reached epidemic levels, and the most common treatments long have been drug interventions. Unfortunately, the prevailing non-pharmaceutical prescription \u2014 to eat less and move more \u2014 has a 99.9% failure rate. Fung observes that popular wisdom tells us to blame the patient and assume he or she did not adhere to the prescription. He claims a basic understanding of metabolism suggests otherwise, however.\n\nFung explains why a significant reduction in caloric intake leads to a decrease in basal metabolism. This biological inevitability is ignored by the proponents of the \u201ccalories in, calories out\u201d fallacy, he observes.\n\nHe also explains why intermittent fasting is an effective alternative to traditional treatments for obesity and diabetes. The modern eating pattern keeps our insulin levels high all the time as we eat over long durations, and when insulin remains high all the time, Fung explains, our bodies store food energy as fat, and we remain hungry. \n\nIntermittent fasting, on the other hand, allows insulin levels to drop, which puts us in burning mode rather than storing mode.\nFung claims his recommendations are so effective that patients no longer need to say, \u201cOh wow, I have to go see my doctor to see what pill I need,\u201d or, \u201cI need to go see my doctor to see if he needs to stick a stent in me.\u201d Instead, Fung explains, \u201cWe\u2019re giving you the power to take back your own health, because you\u2019re not gonna get it from anywhere else.\u201d\n\nCrossFit\u00ae - Forging Elite Fitness\u00ae (",

Maybe you shouldn't even raise money! In this session we'll explore the options and help you think through not just your initial funding but a trajectory to stay funded until you've reached your goal, be that an independent public company or a self-sustaining social venture.  We'll also try to remove the mystique of VC and as usual bring some case examples to bear to bring it all to life.\n\nLearn more about the Harvard Innovation Lab at ",
