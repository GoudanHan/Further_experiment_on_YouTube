                "description": "In this Intelligence Squared event award-winning historian Simon Sebag Montefiore and bestselling novelist Kate Mosse discussed letters by Michelangelo, Catherine the Great, Sarah Bernhardt, Rosa Parks, Virginia Woolf, Alan Turing and Leonard Cohen. Some are inspiring, some unsettling, others express foreboding and despair. Many celebrate love and sex.\n\nNothing beats the immediacy and authenticity of a letter. Letters grant us a glimpse into fascinating lives, whether through the eyes of a genius, a monster or of an ordinary person. Letters also resonate, often many years later, with people who were never meant to see them. They allow us to travel through time and space to share the thoughts of men and women from places, eras and cultures quite different from our own.\n\nA cast of performers, including Young Vic director Kwame Kwei-Armah, rising star Jade Anouka, Dunkirk actor Jack Lowden, and West End star Tamsin Greig, brought the letters to life on stage.\n______________\n\nBrilliant minds, debate, online events, ask your questions.

No writer matches Austen's sensitive ear for the hypocrisy and irony lurking beneath the genteel conversation. Never has a novelist written comic prose with such subtlety and restraint. If you want to understand the early 19th century -- the power of money and inheritance, the clothes, the interior d\u00e9cor -- Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice are worth a dozen history books, and any number of second-rate novels by Austen's contemporaries.\n\nThat's the argument of the Janeites, but to the aficionados of Emily Bront\u00eb they are the misguided worshippers of a circumscribed mind. In Wuthering Heights, Bront\u00eb dispensed with Austen's niceties and the upper-middle class drawing rooms of Bath and the home counties. Her backdrop is the savage Yorkshire moors, her subject the all-consuming passions of the heart. The story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw is a full-blooded tale of violent attraction, thwarted love, death and the supernatural that makes Jane Austen look mundane -- and clutches at the reader's heart with a vigour and directness unmatched in English literature.\n\nTo help you decide who should be crowned queen of English letters we lined up the best advocates to make the case for each writer. They called on actors, including stars Dominic West and Sam West, to illustrate their arguments with readings from the novels.\n\nFilmed at the Royal Geographical Society on 26th February 2014.\n\n_______________\n\nBrilliant minds, debate, online events, ask your questions.

Check out the Intelligence Squared website to hear about future live events and podcasts: http://www.intelligencesquared.com \n__________________________\n\nThe Power of Poetry, with William Sieghart, Jeanette Winterson and Helena Bonham Carter\n\nFor 15 years, the power of the spoken word has been at the heart of Intelligence Squared\u2019s mission. Argument and debate, we believe, can move, persuade and create real change. Now, in these anxious and divided times, we held a special event that celebrated the positive, transformative force of another kind of spoken word \u2013 poetry.\n\nWilliam Sieghart told the extraordinary story of his bestselling book, The Poetry Pharmacy: Tried-and-True Prescriptions for the Heart, Mind and Soul. This is no conventional collection but one created from Sieghart\u2019s own, personal experience of prescribing real poems to real people in need. Every poem is matched to a specific condition: fear of the unknown, unrequited love, stagnation, purposelessness, convalescence, oppression\n\nJoining him in conversation were novelist and poetry devotee Jeanette Winterson. Together they explored poetry\u2019s uncanny ability to calm, console and, above all, connect us to the minds and feelings of others. Finding the right poem at the right moment is not just a problem shared, Sieghart says, but a problem transformed. It is \u2018to discover a powerful sense of complicity, and that precious realisation: I\u2019m not the only one who feels like this.\u2019 It is to forge a connection with \u2018this stranger who understands \u2013 and what results is a sort of peace.\u2019\n\nBringing the poems to dramatic life were a cast of star actors including Helena Bonham Carter, Sue Perkins, Jason Isaacs and Tom Burke.",

Some accounts treat the rise of the strategist as an effect of the functional demands of party competition, linked with technological change and the accumulation of political data; others see the rise of the strategist as a symptom of a larger process of party decline. In this seminar I'll present a different argument: the rise of the strategist was linked with a turn, especially on the left, toward prioritizing markets over constituents. This argument is built on an \"inside-out\" (or refraction) analysis that traces the rise and fall of dominant party experts, attending to the link between their social location and their conceptions of the economic world, democratic politics and experts' public roles.  I will conclude by outlining a new project that builds on this work, tentatively titled Strategy and Democracy.\n\n \n\nStephanie MudgeAbout the Speaker: Stephanie Mudge is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Davis and co-editor of a new book series, Cambridge Studies in Historical Sociology. Her recent book, Leftism Reinvented (2018, Harvard University Press), is a cross-national study of how Western parties of the mainstream left shifted from socialism, to Keynesianism, to neoliberalism over the course of the 20th Century. She has published on a range of topics including neoliberalism, the sociology of parties and European technocratic expertise in venues including the Socio-Economic Review, the American Journal of Sociology and the Annual Review of Sociology. She is presently developing projects on the trajectory of \"independence\" in the case of the European Central Bank and the rise of strategists in American politics.",

However, identity politics has caused deep fragmentations in American society that are predicated on the belief that one group\u2019s inclusion means the other\u2019s exclusion. In his new book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and The Politics of Resentment, Francis Fukuyama, best-selling author and renowned political scientist, addresses the issues of identity politics. \n\nFukuyama argues that our connection to personal identities has disconnected us from universal understandings of human dignity. He agrees that identity is fundamentally democratic and is indeed a pillar of fledgling democracies. However, narrow identities can pit groups against one another and manipulate people\u2019s ability to recognize or seek out mutually inclusive solutions.\n\nFukuyama is a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. He has written a number of successful works on developmental and international politics. Come listen to him deliver a provocative examination of identity and its connection to democracy.",

With political breakdown occurring in many regions across the globe, Fukuyama notes, the failure of governments to provide citizens with basic services and the consequences of widespread political corruption have contributed to democracy\u2019s poor performance. Fukuyama contends that in order for democracies to remain legitimate and to continue to attract new adherents, they must address the constraints imposed upon them by institutions that emphasize rule of law and accountability at the expense of states\u2019 capacities to take strong action.",

We are struggling for recognition on the basis of our race, religion, ethnicity or gender. We focus on our differences rather than on the things that bind us. This gives way to populism and the rise of authoritarian leaders. Come listen to Francis Fukuyama on how we can save democracy from identity politics.\n\nRead the review: ",

Heavy users of social media have twice the rate of depression and anxiety, and five published experiments indicate that the effect is at least partly causal: people who\nstop or reduce social media experience gains in mental health. Dr. Haidt addressed what social media has done to Gen Z, the generation born beginning in 1996. Because social media changes networks, it has effects on most groups and organizations. The big challenge is to find ways to help groups and communities use social media in more healthy ways.",

            "description": "Many would argue that these are the fundamental goals of a good education. So why has Cambridge University taken to warning its students that the sexual violence in Titus Andronicus might be traumatic for them? Why are other universities in America and increasingly in Britain introducing measures to protect students from speech and texts they might find harmful? Safe spaces, trigger warnings and no-platforming are now campus buzzwords \u2013 and they\u2019re all designed to limit free speech and the exchange of ideas. As celebrated social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues in his book 'The Coddling of the American Mind', university students are increasingly retreating from ideas they fear may damage their mental health, and presenting themselves as fragile and in need of protection from any viewpoint that might make them feel unsafe.The culture of safety, as Haidt calls it, may be well intentioned, but it is hampering the development of young people and leaving them unprepared for adult life, with devastating consequences for them, for the companies that will soon hire them, and for society at large.\n\nThat, Haidt\u2019s critics argue, is an infuriating misinterpretation of initiatives designed to help students. Far from wanting to shut down free speech and debate, what really concerns the advocates of these new measures is the equal right to speech in a public forum where the voices of the historically marginalised are given the same weight as those of more privileged groups. Warnings to students that what they\u2019re about to read or hear might be disturbing are not an attempt to censor classic literature, but a call for consideration and sensitivity. Safe spaces aren\u2019t cotton-wool wrapped echo chambers, but places where minority groups and people who have suffered trauma can share their experiences without fear of hostility.\n\nIn November 2018, Haidt came to the Intelligence Squared stage to discuss and debate these ideas. Joining him were the former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who believes that educating young people through debate and argument helps foster robustness, author and activist Eleanor Penny, and sociologist Kehinde Andrews, one of the UK\u2019s leading thinkers on race and the history of racism.",
