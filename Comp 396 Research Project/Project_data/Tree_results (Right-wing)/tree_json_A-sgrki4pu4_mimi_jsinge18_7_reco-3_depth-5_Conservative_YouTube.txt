                "description": "(Aug. 11) When Kathy Hochul becomes New York\u2019s governor in two weeks, cleaning up after Andrew Cuomo will be only one of her newfound problems.\n\nHochul, the 62-year-old lieutenant governor, will take the top job after Cuomo announced his resignation Tuesday, saying harassment allegations against him prevent him from governing. New York and national politicians -- including President Joe Biden -- called on Cuomo to depart after a report by Attorney General Letitia James found he had sexually harassed 11 women.\n\nHochul, who has served a long apprenticeship in Democratic state politics, will be interim executive until Cuomo\u2019s current term finishes in December 2022. Messages seeking an interview Tuesday weren\u2019t immediately returned.\n\nStepping into office post-scandal is a familiar role for Hochul, who in 2011 won a special election to the U.S. House after an extramarital affair felled her predecessor. But she also faces novel challenges: rising Covid cases, a sluggish economic recovery, budgetary crises and a state government battered by Cuomo\u2019s tumultuous final year as governor.\n\n---\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.
