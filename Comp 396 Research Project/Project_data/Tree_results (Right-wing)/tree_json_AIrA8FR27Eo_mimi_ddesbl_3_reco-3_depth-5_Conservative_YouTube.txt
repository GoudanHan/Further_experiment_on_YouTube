Bemoaning your inability to attract a technical co-founder to \"just build it\" is failure's waiting room. Hiring out an agency to build your grand vision now is a great way to lose quickly. In Dan's own words:\n\nLearn from my useful mistakes and occasional successes, from cashing in my 401k to build a mediocre app I didn't need, to bootstrapping through Techstars as the program's only non-technical sole founder, to building out a great team at a (currently) thriving company that just closed a seven figure seed round.\n\nI will focus on the very short term nuts and bolts. We'll talk through what exactly can you do in the next four weeks to substantially move your idea forward. In our conversation, I'll answer questions, share my ideology and process, tips, tools, and talk plainly about the ups and downs of my own experience.\nHow to scope your prototype, what to measure, what it is, and importantly, what it isn't (hint: a first version of your eventual product)\nHow I hack process to get real milestones really quickly that can gut check your assumptions, or make it more attractive to potential technical talent, partners, or investors.\nRemoving false positives from your prototypes, and determine true intention. (Don't ask people to say nice things about you and then take it as evidence).\nCheat sheet on the free or cheap tools that will be your best friend.\nStartup frenemies. How to get good help from good people, and what offers you should refuse.\nNon-technical Founders can build great companies. So many fail by overestimating the first step. Think small, and start building something great.",

Josh Wexler, CEO of the Occom Group, shares the process that they use to help anyone (7th graders to C-level executives) validate new product ideas before they are built. He tells the story of how a first time entrepreneur went from an idea to a fully functioning prototype that he then used to test with potential customers in about 2 days. Josh discusses how this process drives clarity among a team and reduces the technical and overall risk of a project. Participants are guided through a number of exercises to practice the process.\n\nTo learn more about the Harvard Innovation Lab at ",

It starts with a very simple question: what is the difference between those who do something special with their lives and everyone else?  In Outliers we\u0393\u00c7\u00d6re going to visit a genius who lives on a horse farm in Northern Missouri. We\u0393\u00c7\u00d6re going to examine the bizarre histories of professional hockey players and look into the peculiar childhood of Bill Gates and spend time in a Chinese rice paddy.  We will investigate the world\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s greatest law firm and wonder about what distinguishes pilots who crash planes from those who don\u0393\u00c7\u00d6t.  And in examining the lives of the remarkable among us\u0393\u00c7\u00f6the brilliant, the exceptional and the unusual\u0393\u00c7\u00f6we will learn that the way we think about success is all wrong.",
