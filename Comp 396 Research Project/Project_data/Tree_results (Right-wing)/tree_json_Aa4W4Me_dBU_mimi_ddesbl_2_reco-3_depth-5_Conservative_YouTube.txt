Meanwhile, Simone Biles announces she will compete in the balance beam final. So will Canada's Ellie Black. And the stage has been set for Canadian beach volleyball players: Sarah Pavan & Melissa Humana-Paredes and Heather Bansley & Brandie Wilkerson have moved on to the quarterfinals. If each team wins their next games, they'll meet in the semi-final. That means Canada is guaranteed an Olympic medal in women's beach volleyball, which would be a first for the country. \n\nSubscribe to CBC Sports: ",

    "description": "CNN Anchor SHOCKED When NYT Writer Says 2nd Civil War Is COMING Unless Trump Wins In A Landslide. Thomas Friedman warned that unless Trump wins there will be a civil war, but then says vote for Joe Biden.\n\nDemocrats and mainstream media have been continually warning of a 2nd American Civil War. The weirdest thing is that they say Trump won't accept the results of the election while Hillary Clinton tells Joe Biden not to concede under any circumstances and in a war game Democrats even threatened to have western blue states secede from the Union.\n\nPerhaps this is just an attempt to scare people into voting.\n\nIf it is, it makes no sense to warn of a civil war if Biden wins.",
