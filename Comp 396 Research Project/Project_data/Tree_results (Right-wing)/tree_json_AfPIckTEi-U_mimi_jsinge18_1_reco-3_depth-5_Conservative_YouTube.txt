Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss.

She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye\u2019s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.",

Together with his trusted lieutenant (Jonah Hill) and a merry band of brokers, Belfort makes a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy investors out of millions.

Jessup (Jack Nicholson from The Shining and Batman) in court about the death of a Marine. The Colonel dismissed the Lieutenant\u2019s questions as being unimportant to the case, so he stands up heads to the door to leave the room. However, he is stopped in the action as the Lieutenant says that he didn\u2019t dismiss him and is asked to go back to his seat for further questioning. The conversation intensifies when the flight records are brought in. The Lieutenant asks the Colonel why his man was in danger when all the orders have to go through him. The Colonel explains that he did what was best for the country and his men and does not need to explain himself.\n\n\nClick to Buy/Rent A Few Good Men on iTunes: ",

                    "description": "In the 13 years since Super Size Me, the fast-food industry has undergone a makeover. Today, chain restaurants tout food that's \"healthy,\" \"organic,\" and \"natural.\" Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock explores this new reality with an approach even more immersive and subversive than that used for his first film: he sets out to open his own chicken franchise. We follow him every step of the way, from raising poultry and conjuring recipes to designing the brand and scouting a location. Spurlock brings his disarming humor to uncover the truths and lies behind this multibillion-dollar industry.Navigating a world of cynics and opportunists, Spurlock comes across like a hillbilly Jimmy Stewart with refreshing optimism. He confronts one challenge after another in his mission to live up to his ideals. The film feels especially timely when the US has a junk-food-loving President and an epidemic of false claims in advertising. Spurlock pays close attention to the Orwellian buzzwords that marketers use to bring a \"health halo\" to industrial food. While the original Super Size Me made a specific example of McDonald's, this compelling sequel focuses on new targets and doesn't hold back on naming names. The film builds momentum towards the day when Spurlock puts his reputation on the line by serving his first customers.",

And boy did Don come prepared with some tough questions for the \u2018big guy\u2019.\u201d\n\nBiden was asked to name one extraordinary moment since becoming president and instead of providing an answer, he rambled about being told to close doors.\n\n\u201cOne thing, just one thing that has stood out to you during your time as the leader of the free world,\u201d Mr Houghton said.\n\n\u201cBut apparently it was cognitively too difficult for Biden who started rambling about times he\u2019s been told to close the door and how often he is asked 'Mr President why are you going outside.'\u201d\n\nMr Houghton said tragically, it wasn\u2019t even the craziest thing to be said at the town hall, with the moment Biden starts raving about whether there is a man on the moon having gone viral this week.\n\n\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t just comically bizarre gaffes, Biden made plenty of factually incorrect statements, some of which Don Lemon helped him correct in the moment before quickly trying to move on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGeez, talk about a media protection racket. Could you imagine CNN doing that for Donald Trump, or any Republican if they made a slight mistake.\u201d",
