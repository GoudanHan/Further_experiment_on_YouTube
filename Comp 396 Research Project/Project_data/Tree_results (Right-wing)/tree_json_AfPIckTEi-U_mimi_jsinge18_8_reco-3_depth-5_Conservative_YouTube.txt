            "description": "Speculation continues to build on whether a federal election could happen any day now as the Liberal government under Justin Trudeau appears to be aiming for a majority. But with an election having happened less than two years ago and Canada on the precipice of a fourth wave of COVID-19, it has Canadians wondering why we could head to the polls all over again in what's often called a snap election. \n\nWith a minority government, the Trudeau Liberals could face a defeat at any time due to a confidence vote, but with the House of Commons not currently in session and thus no confidence vote possible, there's only one way an election could actually take place.\n\nSean Previl, with help from Global News chief political correspondent David Akin, tries to answer the question of why we could be voting once again.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",

These are not your typical dealership horror stories. these are stories from the inside out.\n\nPer request of my awesome viewers and to mix up my content. Here is the third installment of Dealership Stories from the inside out!\n\nWorking at a car dealership and dealing with hundreds of people and their cars as my full time job as a Toyota Master Diagnostic Technician is.... Interesting to say the least. While most people that come to a dealership come with good intentions and treat everyone with respect. There's always those that take advantage of situations or just simply behave in a strange way.\n\nDealerships are called stealer-ships by many. Truthfully some dealerships are horrible but some are good. Very hard to tell which is which unless you experience them and get to know the people that work there then you'll know for sure.\n\nCatch up on some previous dealership stories videos that I've made here:",

It's called methane. \n\n\u201cThis newer scarier gas is produced from shale gas wells, poorly managed conventional oil and gas extraction, and methane comes from the farming of animals.\n\n\u201cThat's right, the latest villain in the climate cult's never-ending scare campaign are cows and sheep. I mean forget about China who are building more and more coal-fired power plants.\u201d\n\nMr Dean said he learnt this week that emissions from cows on New Zealand dairy farms have reached record levels.\n\n\u201cData from Stats NZ, just released for the years 2007-2019, shows dairy emissions from the climate socialist paradise of saint Jacinda Ardern rose by 3.18 per cent in 2019, to a total of 17,719 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou'll remember when a couple of years ago Jacinda Ardern had the nerve to lecture Australia on our emissions. \n\n\u201cSo imagine my surprise to see this graph which shows that between 1990 and 2018 New Zealand's emissions rose by 57 per cent \u2013 the second greatest increase of all industrialised countries \u2013 at the same time as Australia's fell by 13 per cent. \n\n\u201cBut you watch \u2013 when the IPCC report is published this week, all the climate hysteria will be focused not on the hypocritical Ardern, but it will all be about the terrible climate change scary monster called Australia and the evils of mining coal.\u201d",

To all you dads out there, he says, \"NEVER PASS UP A CHANCE TO DANCE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER!\" He also said that this dance was his chance to treat his daughter how she should be treated (as a princess). Sooo tender.\n\nThe dance started out so sweet and traditional and caught everyone by surprise. Haha! I loved filming Mikayla and her dad's epic and awesome choreographed daddy daughter wedding dance.\n\nFilmed with love by yours truly,\nBP Film & Photo \nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: @bpfilmandphoto\n\n\nAnd if anyone decides to do a dance to the same mashup, SHARE A VIDEO with our hashtag ",
