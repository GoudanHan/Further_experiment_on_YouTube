It's called methane. \n\n\u201cThis newer scarier gas is produced from shale gas wells, poorly managed conventional oil and gas extraction, and methane comes from the farming of animals.\n\n\u201cThat's right, the latest villain in the climate cult's never-ending scare campaign are cows and sheep. I mean forget about China who are building more and more coal-fired power plants.\u201d\n\nMr Dean said he learnt this week that emissions from cows on New Zealand dairy farms have reached record levels.\n\n\u201cData from Stats NZ, just released for the years 2007-2019, shows dairy emissions from the climate socialist paradise of saint Jacinda Ardern rose by 3.18 per cent in 2019, to a total of 17,719 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou'll remember when a couple of years ago Jacinda Ardern had the nerve to lecture Australia on our emissions. \n\n\u201cSo imagine my surprise to see this graph which shows that between 1990 and 2018 New Zealand's emissions rose by 57 per cent \u2013 the second greatest increase of all industrialised countries \u2013 at the same time as Australia's fell by 13 per cent. \n\n\u201cBut you watch \u2013 when the IPCC report is published this week, all the climate hysteria will be focused not on the hypocritical Ardern, but it will all be about the terrible climate change scary monster called Australia and the evils of mining coal.\u201d",
