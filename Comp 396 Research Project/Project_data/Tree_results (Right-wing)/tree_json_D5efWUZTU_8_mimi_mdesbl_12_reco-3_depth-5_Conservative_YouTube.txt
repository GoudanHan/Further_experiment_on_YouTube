                    "description": "The purpose of this talk is to raise and reinforce awareness of how we talk about mental health in Black men. Malissa wants the world to know that when a Black man makes a PEEP, this is your time to Pause and Listen, Elevate their voice, Encourage them to tap into their resources, and Be Present. The advent of social movement, Black Lives Matter, emphasizing more and more why the world needs to protect Black people. We might have only one Black person in our lives, this individual deserves our utmost attention and care. This individual should be allowed to share their feelings, affirm what they are going through, and validate their experiences. Therefore, if your vulnerable friends share their lowest moments with you, that means they trust you and it is important for you to follow the strategy: PEEP.\n As a first-generation Haitian American scholar, Malissa has been through challenges that she encountered in her personal life, academic and professional careers. Her journey has molded and shaped her to become self-reliant, resilient, studious, and passionate agent of transformative goals. Malissa\u2019s personal mantra is \u201cThis is Bigger Than Myself.\u201d\nIn November of 2020, she successfully defended her dissertation that seeks to better understand mental health issues within the Black community, particularly among Black college men. Malissa knew that her dedication to research in mental health would help her community, as well as the students she interacts with in her professional pursuits, immensely. Her dissertation \u201cIf You Can\u2019t Make A Sound, Make A Peep: A Narrative Inquiry of the Lived Collegiate Experiences of Black Male Students Who Dealt with Suicide Ideation\u201d focuses on Black men and their mental health, how they choose to get help, resources and support they deemed to be the most helpful.

                    "description": "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Physical Fitness does not have to be complicated.   There are psychological aspects to staying motivated for fitness and then a few rules to adopt for success.  The speaker presents his ideas on motivation,  measuring your fitness level, and exercises to become fit.  \n\nOgie Shaw is a native of Raleigh, NC. He is a veteran of the US Army and served in Vietnam. Afterwards, he graduated from UNC at Chapel Hill earning degrees in both Speech and Physical Education, later earning certification as a Health Promotion Director from the Cooper Institute\u00ae in Dallas, Texas. He served with the Portland Police Bureau and later joined a national network of medical and fitness leaders dedicated to teaching the health benefits of daily exercise. He has been an author, counselor, seminary graduate and pastor to Portland-area retirement homes. He has trained the Portland Trailblazers and Seattle Seahawks, and he has been asked to write a book on his work providing fitness training for paraplegics.\n\nOgie has had a passion for fitness, health, business, and music all of his life. His career goal is to establish a model for a fitness lifestyle for Americans that is sufficient to impact physical and mental health. He has given over 5000 speeches on fitness motivation.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

In a time when photographs of Amy Winehouse in many states dominated the front pages, each new picture surpassing the last, as she appeared to incrementally crumble under the cocktail that was the magnitude of her success, it was her unique and heartfelt music that touched the hearts of millions of fans.

This is sensible: academics who work outside academia are endlessly criticized for writing \"like a professor\".  Worse, writers who are criticized in this way are often baffled at how to adapt to their new world.  Very often, they try to change aspects of their writing that are not troublesome, and they leave in place aspects of their writing that are making their writing less clear, less logical, and less valuable to their readers. \n\nThis session will be about a few patterns of writing that are likely to aggravate non-academic readers.  We'll focus on patterns that are often difficult for academics to see, but are actually fairly easy to change.",

He is also author of the ground-breaking book \"How To Avoid Death By PowerPoint\" published in more than 30 countries.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

He exited the forest, on the brink of death and still haunted by personal demons, to eventually gain a Ph.D., become a university lecturer in the Faculty of Business, Law, and Arts and become an ambassador for Australia\u2019s \u2018forgotten children\u2019. This incredible story is a personal testament to \u2018never giving up\u2019. Dr. Gregory P. Smith is a survivor, an academic, and a social researcher. Homeless for much of his adult life living as a recluse in a forest near Byron Bay, he now has a Ph.D. in Sociology and teaches at Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. In 2018 he published his memoir \u2018Out of the Forest\u2019 with Penguin Random House and has been the subject of two Australian documentaries. His profoundly touching and uplifting memoir is at once a unique insight into how far off track a life can go and a powerful reminder that we can all find our way back. Gregory is heavily involved in advocating for the vulnerable and disadvantaged and continues to be the patron of a number of charity organisations while also consulting with several specialist services and agencies. Currently, Dr. Smith is engaged as a consultant and program evaluator in the Premiers Priority Project to reduce rough sleeping in NSW, Australia by 50% in 2025 and zero by 2030.

                "description": "Completely disillusioned with a society that rejected him, Gregory P. Smith walked into a rainforest near Byron Bay and became a hermit for 10 years. He exited the forest, on the brink of death and still haunted by personal demons, to eventually gain a Ph.D., become a university lecturer in the Faculty of Business, Law, and Arts and become an ambassador for Australia\u2019s \u2018forgotten children\u2019. This incredible story is a personal testament to \u2018never giving up\u2019. Dr. Gregory P. Smith is a survivor, an academic, and a social researcher. Homeless for much of his adult life living as a recluse in a forest near Byron Bay, he now has a Ph.D. in Sociology and teaches at Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. In 2018 he published his memoir \u2018Out of the Forest\u2019 with Penguin Random House and has been the subject of two Australian documentaries. His profoundly touching and uplifting memoir is at once a unique insight into how far off track a life can go and a powerful reminder that we can all find our way back. Gregory is heavily involved in advocating for the vulnerable and disadvantaged and continues to be the patron of a number of charity organisations while also consulting with several specialist services and agencies. Currently, Dr. Smith is engaged as a consultant and program evaluator in the Premiers Priority Project to reduce rough sleeping in NSW, Australia by 50% in 2025 and zero by 2030. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",
