                    "description": "Germany is one of the world\u2019s richest countries, but inequality is on the rise. The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind. \n\nFor the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gr\u00f6ner, one of Germany\u2019s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. \"If you have great wealth, you can\u2019t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts. \"Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we\u2019re more independent,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanovi\u0107, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. \"These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,\" Milanovi\u0107 notes. \"Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?\u201d\n\nPart 1: ",

More than 100 others are still missing.\n\nThis could be the worst waterway disaster in more than 60 years in China.\n\nHundreds of bodies were found after the ship was overturned by rescuers using a crane and raised above the river.\n\nHooks are attached to the vessel and nets are wrapped around the hull to pull it up.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, the ship could be seen lying on its side, with its name above the water.\n\nXinhua News Agency later posted on their Twitter account an image of the ship turned over, with the roof broken.\n\nMost of the 14 survivors jumped into the river when the ship began to sink. Three others were rescued by divers while trapped in airbags in the overturned hull.\n\nAuthorities said there was no sign of survivors inside the ship, Xinhua said.\n\nAccidents like this are still common in China, due to the lack of strict safety measures, in addition to the fact that the means of transport are still quite primitive. But this is China's most catastrophic accident in 2021. Its damage was comparable to a flood that devastated China.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping said he would open an investigation into the cause of the accident, after relatives of passengers protested at the scene. But in fact, these are the words of Mr. Xi to cover the eyes of the victims' relatives, but he knows well that these passenger ships of his often carry too many and do not have measures to ensure the safety of the victims. passenger.\n\nAuthorities are keeping tight control of the area at the scene, prompting many families and reporters to complain about the lack of information.\n\nThe cause of the capsizing is still unknown, but survivors say a strong thunderstorm caused the boat to capsize within minutes.\n\nThe captain and chief engineer were among the first to escape and are being held.\n\nMaritime safety agency records show the ship was investigated for violating safety rules the previous year.\n\nThe Orient Star ship was detained along with five other ships in 2020 for safety issues.\n\nThe sinking of the Oriental Star could be the deadliest maritime accident in China since the SS Kiangya birdbath off Shanghai in 1948, which killed between 2,750 and 4,000 people.",

                "description": "Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market \u2013 the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? \n\nFor years, the world\u2019s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.\n\nThe fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it\u2019s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: \"This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more.\" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it\u2019s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It\u2019s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates.\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Apr\u00e8s des mois d\u2019escalade verbale et de tensions entre la Russie et les \u00c9tats-Unis, Vladimir Poutine et Joe Biden se rencontrent cet apr\u00e8s-midi en terrain neutre. Mais les deux chefs d\u2019\u00c9tat s\u2019appr\u00e9cient peu et les sujets de discorde sont nombreux.  \n \nUkraine, B\u00e9larus, sort de l\u2019opposant russe emprisonn\u00e9 Alexe\u00ef Navalny, projet Nord Stream 2, armement strat\u00e9gique, cyberattaques\u2026 Sur tous ces dossiers, les discussions s\u2019annoncent \u00e2pres et difficiles entre deux hommes adeptes du franc-parler et des formules cinglantes. Ainsi dans un entretien au New Yorker, Joe Biden a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours de leur premier face-\u00e0-face en 2011, lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait vice-pr\u00e9sident de Barack Obama, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au Premier ministre de l\u2019\u00e9poque : \"Je vous regarde dans les yeux et je ne pense pas que vous ayez une \u00e2me.\" Ce \u00e0 quoi Vladimir Poutine a r\u00e9pondu : \"Nous nous comprenons\". Ou encore, plus r\u00e9cemment, quand le pr\u00e9sident des \u00c9tats-Unis a r\u00e9pondu sans h\u00e9siter \u00e0 une question d\u2019un journaliste : \"Poutine est-il un tueur ?\"\"Oui je le pense et vous verrez bient\u00f4t le prix qu\u2019il va payer\". L\u00e0 encore, la r\u00e9ponse du chef du Kremlin ne s\u2019est pas fait attendre. Le lendemain, Vladimir Poutine s\u2019est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et a affirm\u00e9 : \"C\u2019est celui qui le dit qui l\u2019est\".\n \nPour autant, apr\u00e8s six mois d\u2019\u00e9changes mordants par m\u00e9dias interpos\u00e9s, ces derni\u00e8res semaines des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s on a sembl\u00e9 vouloir renouer le dialogue. \"Le moment de la d\u00e9sescalade est venu\" a estim\u00e9 le mois dernier Joe Biden. \"Les relations russo-am\u00e9ricaines sont actuellement dans l'impasse, la situation est proche d'\u00eatre critique. Il faut faire quelque chose\", a affirm\u00e9 hier Iouri Ouchakov, proche conseiller de Vladimir Poutine. C\u2019est donc arm\u00e9s de meilleurs intentions que les deux hommes se retrouvent pendant quatre heures aujourd\u2019hui pour \u00e9voquer les sujets qui f\u00e2chent et les \"lignes rouges\" \u00e0 ne pas franchir.\n \nPas de grandes annonces n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 attendre. Aucune conf\u00e9rence de presse commune n\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs au programme. Mais cette rencontre a un objectif dans la dur\u00e9e : rendre les relations entre les deux pays plus \"stables et pr\u00e9visibles\".\n \nAlors quels sont les enjeux de cette rencontre entre Joe Biden et Vladimir Poutine ? Pourquoi le gazoduc Nord Stream 2 est-il une source de tensions entre Russes, Am\u00e9ricains et Europ\u00e9ens ?\n \nInvit\u00e9s :\n \n- Fran\u00e7ois Clemenceau, r\u00e9dacteur en chef du service \u00e9tranger \u2013  Le Journal du dimanche\n- Tatiana Kastoueva-Jean, directrice du Centre Russie/NEI de l\u2019Institut Fran\u00e7ais des Relations Internationales\n- Jean-Dominique Giuliani, pr\u00e9sident de la Fondation Robert Schuman et de l\u2019ILERI\n- Nicole Bacharan, historienne et politologue sp\u00e9cialiste des Etats-Unis, auteure de \"First Ladies\"\n\nRetrouvez-nous sur :\n| Notre site : ",

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

                "description": "Science writer, biologist, neuroscientist, and stress expert Dr. Robert Sapolsky presents the inaugural Fenton-Rhodes Lecture on Proactve Wellness.  \n\nSapolsky states that our bodies' stress response evolved to help us get out of short-term physical emergencies - if a lion is chasing you, you run. But such reactions, he points out, compromise long-term physical health in favor of immediate self-preservation. Unfortunately, when confronted with purely psychological stressors, such as troubleshooting the fax machine, modern humans turn on the same stress response. \"If you turn it on for too long,\" notes Sapolsky, \"you get sick.\" Sapolsky regards this sobering news with characteristic good humor, finding hope in \"our own capacity to prevent some of these problems... in the small steps with which we live our everyday lives.\"\n\nThis lecture was recorded on September 22, 2016 at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts' Colwell Playhouse as part of the Pygmalion TechFest",
