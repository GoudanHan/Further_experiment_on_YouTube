For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nU.S. stocks edged higher on Thursday, pushing both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 to fresh records during an otherwise tame session.\n\nThe Dow rose 14.88 points to 35,499.85, a record close for the blue-chip index. The S&P 500 climbed 0.3% to 4,460.83, also a record. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with a gain of 0.3% to end the day at 14,816.26.\n\nAmong the S&P sectors, health care and tech outperformed with gains of about 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively, while energy, industrials and materials stocks lagged. Salesforce and Apple were the best-performing stocks in the Dow, while Home Depot and Visa slipped.\n\n\u201cDespite the relatively placid surface, there are some more gyrations under the surface of the S&P 500 today,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Hussey.\n\n\u201cIndustrials, Materials, and Energy all led the S&P 500 through the last few sessions, supported in parted by the hopes for increased infrastructure spending, but are now the worst performers today,\u201d he added. \u201cConversely, we\u2019re seeing a rotation back into long duration stocks, including Tech, Healthcare, and Comm Services.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department reported Thursday morning that initial jobless claims declined slightly last week as the U.S. labor market continues its recovery from last year\u2019s recession. There were 375,000 claims last week, matching estimates. The prior reading came in at 385,000 claims, but was revised to 387,000.\n\nThe prices U.S. manufacturers and other businesses pay for labor, raw materials and other goods rose again in July. The government said its producer price index, excluding volatile food, trade services and energy components, rose 0.9% last month versus a forecast for a 0.5% gain.\n\nThe update to producer price inflation came a day after the Labor Department said consumer prices surged 5.4% from a year earlier, for the month of July, and 0.5% from the previous month. Core inflation, however, rose by just 0.3% in July, below the 0.4% increase forecast.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: ",

And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020. \n\n\nArtist:                   Secret Garden\nAlbum:                Earthsongs\nTrack:                   Lotus\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

On the right side the slope of x is 1.\n\nChain Rule:  dx/dy dy/dx = 1   Here this says that df^-1/dy times df/dx equals 1.\n\nSo the derivative of f^-1(y)  is  1/ (df/dx)  BUT you have to write df/dx in terms of y.\nThe derivative of ln y is 1/ (derivative of f = e^x) = 1/e^x.   This is  1/y, a neat slope !\nChanging letters is OK :  The derivative of ln x is 1/x.  Watch this video for GRAPHS",

This is sensible: academics who work outside academia are endlessly criticized for writing \"like a professor\".  Worse, writers who are criticized in this way are often baffled at how to adapt to their new world.  Very often, they try to change aspects of their writing that are not troublesome, and they leave in place aspects of their writing that are making their writing less clear, less logical, and less valuable to their readers. \n\nThis session will be about a few patterns of writing that are likely to aggravate non-academic readers.  We'll focus on patterns that are often difficult for academics to see, but are actually fairly easy to change.",

It can be difficult to determine whether a random variable actually has a Poisson distribution, so here  I look at a few examples and some visual illustrations that may help. There are no probability calculations carried out in this video.  I assume that the viewer has already been introduced to the Poisson distribution, but I do a brief review at the start.",

It explains how to determine the probability density function as well as how to graph it and shade the appropriate region.  The probability is equal to the area under the curve.  This video explains  how to calculate the mean, standard deviation, median and variance.  It also discusses how to calculate the value of quartiles and percentiles for uniform distribution problems.  It also explains how to calculate the conditional probability in this setting.\n\nMy Website:  ",

Strapped with several patents and a decade of research, Professor Gouma will introduce her world-changing invention, a breathalyzer that can detect COVID-19. This disruptive nanotechnology for the early and rapid detection of the infectious pandemic disease relies on selectively identifying the gases that signal the disease in an exhaled breath and gives you results within 15 seconds. Dr. Gouma, a former graduate of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Greece, University of Liverpool, and The University of Birmingham, is currently the Edward Orton Jr., Chair in Ceramic Engineering at The Ohio State University. She has conducted research that involved the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials for bio-/chemical sensors and biotechnology. She has established novel and highly successful programs on nanomedicine, with emphasis on the development of non-invasive breath and skin-based diagnostic tools. She's been featured as an expert in nanomaterials, ceramics, sensors, and photocatalysts in numerous press releases and has publications. She holds 18 patents and is a member of the National Academy of Inventors and is the Founder and Director of the Center for Nanomaterials and Sensor Development. She was a Fulbright Scholar, received the Richard M. Fulrath award of The American Ceramic Society and has been elected a Fellow of The American Ceramic Society. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",
