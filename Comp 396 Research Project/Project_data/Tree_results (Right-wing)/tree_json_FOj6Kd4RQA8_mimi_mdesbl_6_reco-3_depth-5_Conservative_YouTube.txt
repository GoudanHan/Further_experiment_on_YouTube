                    "description": "CNBC's Rick Santelli reports on consumer price index data from July 2021. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nPrices that Americans pay for everyday goods and services rose in July as pent-up demand for travel and restaurants kept inflation hot, but jumped about as much as economists had expected.\n\nThe Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June\u2019s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008.\n\nThe government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nSo-called core inflation, which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June\u2019s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June\u2019s 4.5%.\n\nEconomists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it\u2019s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices.\n\nSharp decelerations in inflation in select areas of the economy that had seen rapid price increases in the spring helped keep the headline numbers in check.\n\nUsed car and truck prices, which rose rapidly between April and June as Americans looked to vacation, gained just 0.2% in July after a climb of more than 10% in the prior month.\n\nApparel prices were flat after a 0.7% increase in June, and transportation services prices actually declined after a pop of more than 1% at the end of the second quarter.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been keeping a close eye on inflation reports since it\u2019s the central bank\u2019s job to maximize employment and keep prices stable.\n\nChairman Jerome Powell and other officials acknowledge the recent acceleration in prices but believe that the inflation is \u201ctransitory\u201d and that prices won\u2019t continue to increase at their current pace for too long.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s CPI data should help assuage investor fears that the Fed is too laid-back about inflation pressures,\u201d wrote Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. \u201cThe details of the data release suggest some easing in the reopening and supply-shortage driven boost to prices, and tentatively suggests that inflation may have peaked. Investors in the transitory camp will feel slightly vindicated.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has kept interest rates near zero for the past 12 months and continues to flush financial markets with $120 billion in emergency monthly bond purchases. Some members of the central bank, including Vice Chair Richard Clarida, have started to give forecasts for eventual interest-rate increases.\n\nAs one of the most-cited inflation gauges, the consumer price index measures changes in how much American consumers pay for everyday goods and services including groceries, gasoline, clothes, restaurant meals, haircuts, concerts and automobiles.\n\nThe CPI and other price measures have been on the rise in 2021 in large part thanks to a comeback in consumer spending and U.S. gross domestic product as Covid restrictions eased.\n\nEconomic activity as measured by GDP rose at an annualized rate of 6.5% in the second quarter as Americans flocked to restaurants, headed for summer vacations and otherwise resumed activities that Covid-19 had hindered.\n\nConsumer spending, bolstered by the nationwide rollout of vaccines, jumped 11.8% during the three months ended June 30, the second-fastest rate since 1952.\n\nAt the same time, the pent-up demand for travel, retail and restaurants has left many businesses scrambling to keep up and led to several hiccups on the supply side of the U.S. economy.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: ",

Her partner went to the hospital.\n\nWhen Mayor Lightfoot went to the hospital to visit the injured police officer, Mr Murray said the family \"did not want her to be there\" and the police officers present \"turned their back on her\"\n\n\"Are police human beings? Yes. Are they perfect? No. But do they deserve to have their funding cut at a time when crime goes through the roof? Absolutely not.\n\n\"Good on the cops.\"",

I also included the extended take of You Never Give Me Your Money as found in The Beatles Rock Band, which includes a bit more guitar solo.\n\nHowever, to get all the masters to line up correctly, I had to use the Beatles RB stems, so the mix sounds a tad dryer than you may be used to, so my apologies if it's a bother. This is mostly just a fun experiment to see how the album may have turned out.\n\n1: You Never Give Me Your Money (",

I also included the extended take of You Never Give Me Your Money as found in The Beatles Rock Band, which includes a bit more guitar solo.\n\nHowever, to get all the masters to line up correctly, I had to use the Beatles RB stems, so the mix sounds a tad dryer than you may be used to, so my apologies if it's a bother. This is mostly just a fun experiment to see how the album may have turned out.\n\n1: You Never Give Me Your Money (",

Donald Trump, Brexit and a host of populist movements have been fuelled by anger with the way things are. Where does it come from? How best to respond?\n\nOne much discussed, provocative perspective comes not from a politician, but from psychologist and writer Peterson - whose defence of traditional values has won him a worldwide following. Is his diagnosis liberating or dangerous? \n\nInterviewed Guest - Jordan Bernt Peterson\nInterviewer - Stephen Sackur",

At around the 08:40 mark Michael Dyson calls Peterson a \"mean mad white man\", to prove some type of point. Peterson then goes on to devastate him by the end of the discussion.  The whole two hour debate was between Jordan Peterson and Stephen Fry versus Michael Dyson and Michelle Goldberg.

Sandel presents some contemporary cases in which cost-benefit analysis was used to put a dollar value on human life. The cases give rise to several objections to the utilitarian logic of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number. Should we always give more weight to the happiness of a majority, even if the majority is cruel or ignoble? Is it possible to sum up and compare all values using a common measure like money?\n\nPART TWO: HOW TO MEASURE PLEASURE\n\nSandel introduces J.S. Mill, a utilitarian philosopher who attempts to defend utilitarianism against the objections raised by critics of the doctrine. Mill argues that seeking the greatest good for the greatest number is compatible with protecting individual rights, and that utilitarianism can make room for a distinction between higher and lower pleasures. Mills idea is that the higher pleasure is always the pleasure preferred by a well-informed majority. Sandel tests this theory by playing video clips from three very different forms of entertainment: Shakespeares Hamlet, the reality show Fear Factor, and The Simpsons. Students debate which experience provides the higher pleasure, and whether Mills defense of utilitarianism is successful.",

But such reactions, he points out, compromise long-term physical health in favor of immediate self-preservation. Unfortunately, when confronted with purely psychological stressors, such as troubleshooting the fax machine, modern humans turn on the same stress response. \"If you turn it on for too long,\" notes Sapolsky, \"you get sick.\" Sapolsky regards this sobering news with characteristic good humor, finding hope in \"our own capacity to prevent some of these problems... in the small steps with which we live our everyday lives.\"\n\nThis lecture was recorded on September 22, 2016 at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts' Colwell Playhouse as part of the Pygmalion TechFest",

The tool allows scientists to make precise edits to DNA strands, which could lead to treatments for genetic diseases \u2026 but could also be used to create so-called \"designer babies.\" Doudna reviews how CRISPR-Cas9 works \u2014 and asks the scientific community to pause and discuss the ethics of this new tool.\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

A radioactive ooze that mutated their DNA in just the right way to give them the ability to walk upright, talk, and do ninjutsu. Now, I'm as a big a Turtle fan as they come (Donatello is my main man) but this is a highly inaccurate way to portray mutation.
