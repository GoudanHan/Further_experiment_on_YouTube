                    "description": "PART 1 | July 23, 1983 - It\u2019s a calm summer evening. Air Canada flight 143 is on its way to Edmonton from Montreal. Captain Bob Pearson and First Officer Maurice Quintal are both veteran pilots, but they\u2019re flying a new automated Boeing 767.  Midway through the flight, things begin to go horribly wrong. The plane is in danger of running out of fuel. Pearson decides to land as soon as possible. He heads for Winnipeg. As he descends he loses one engine, then another. The huge Boeing is powerless and falling from the sky \u2013 it won\u2019t make it to Winnipeg, Gimli, a decommissioned air base nearby, is the best bet.  \n\nBut the only way for Pearson to get his plane safely down is to try a manoeuvre that only glider pilots would know about. Bob Pearson flies gliders in his spare time and forces the plane into a sideways free fall. It\u2019s called a sideslip. As Pearson touches down, his front landing gear collapsed, his rear tires blow. The first-ever 767 to land without engines does so without so much as a single serious injury. \n\nFrom Season 5 Episode 2 \"Gimli Glider\": Air Canada 143 (Boeing 767) It\u2019s a calm summer evening when an inexplicable failure strikes \u2013 the loss of two engines on a brand new passenger jet midway between Montreal and Edmonton. Powerless at 30-thousand feet, the pilot needs all his skill, and a little bit of luck, to get his plane to the airport. But his saga doesn\u2019t end there \u2013 because the runway he thought was abandoned is anything but. \n\nWelcome to the OFFICIAL Mayday: Air Disaster YouTube Channel. \n\nMayday: Air Disaster is a dramatic non-fiction series that investigates high-profile air disasters to uncover how and why they happened.

We\u2019re going to analyze Chris\u2019s body language from police body cameras to show you when police knew he did it.\n\nChris Watts is the Frederick (northern Colorado) man who eventually admitted to murdering his pregnant wife (Shanann Watts, pregnant with Nico Lee Watts) and two young daughters (Bella Watts and Celeste Watts) on the morning of August 13, 2018.  Early that morning, Chris Watts covered up the scene of his crime by loading his deceased pregnant wife and two young daughters into the back seat of his work truck, which took him about 50 minutes.\n\nHis pregnant wife, Shanann, was found buried in a shallow grave in an eastern Colorado oil field (CERVI 319) where Chris worked and the bodies of his two little girls were found dumped in oil tanks.  I live just 40 minutes south of where all this happened, so this case literally hits close to home.\n\nAt first Chris Watts claimed his family was just missing and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to start in this video. We\u2019re going to watch through police body cameras how this first day unfolded and I\u2019ll point out Chris\u2019s body language which caused police to really suspect he was guilty.  Since cameras are now everywhere with doorbell cameras, police body cameras, and cell phone cameras, it\u2019s shocking to witness first-hand how everything unfolded and then unraveled quickly for Chris that first day.\n\nIn the comments: What do you think Chris Watts was thinking about when he was watching his neighbor's security camera footage?\n\nGive this video a thumbs up so I know you liked it and I\u2019ll do a follow up video on the FBI\u2019s interrogation tactics used on Chris Watts, which got him to finally confess.\n\nSubscribe for more body language and investigative videos.\n\nRelated Videos:\nBody Language Proof Chris Watts Murdered His Two Young Daughters",

Meanwhile White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany is grilled over Trump not denouncing white supremacy or the Proud Boys in a way that pleased the media, to which she reads a long list of quotes where he did just that. Dave gives his thoughts on the media's pushing of the \"Trump is a racist\" narrative, no matter how much proof to the contrary there is. Meanwhile In 1984 Newspeak news the Associated Press Stylebook issued guidance to use the word \"unrest\" instead of \u201criot\u201d. Finally Dave discusses Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong taking a stand against toxic politics in the workplace.\n\nWatch The Rubin Report on BlazeTV:",
