WITH GRAHAM NORTON at 11/10c.\n \nThe UK's biggest, most outrageous talk show has returned for its 10th season with must-see guests: Oscar winner Robin Williams, actor Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings, Wilfred), iconic comedienne Jennifer Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous) and British boyband JLS. As always, expect Norton's trademark comedy monologues and eccentric stories.\n \nHere, Robin Williams discusses a mortifying omission as he accepted his Oscar in 1998 for Good Will Hunting - sorry, Mom! And Hobbit extraordinaire Elijah Wood recalls a hysterical encounter with Hollywood legend (and proud non-Ring-er) Jack Nicholson backstage at the Golden Globes... complete with dead-on, laugh-out-loud impressions.\n \nDon't miss all new episodes of The Graham Norton Show, every Saturday at 10/9c.

    "description": "Trump Dropped His 2nd Term Agenda And Any Sane Person Would Agree With It, I Now Plan To Vote Trump. I certainly dragged that out as long as I possibly could.\n\nTrump's 2nd term agenda is more than just his plans for reelection it is a sign that the establishment politicians are being routed and now he may finally finish them off, figuratively of course.\n\nRepublicans have put out no new party platform  and the Democrats are in complete disarray. I do not believe any sane person could support Biden and its true, most people voting for him are doing it just because they hate Trump.\n\nBut for me the riots are too much, the chaos is too much, and Trump is pushing for congressional term limits as well as ending our forever wars.\n\nI'm not confident that he will do as promised or even be able to but I have seen enough now to vote against Democrats and Joe Biden and support Trump's efforts to end our middle eastern excursions\n\nI can imagine that the left's only response will be that I somehow betrayed my principles as a liberal by now announcing I intend to vote Trump but honestly I don't care what they think. It's a fake argument and I acknowledge I will concede some areas of policy but my top issues right now are ending the riots and ending the wars.  ",
