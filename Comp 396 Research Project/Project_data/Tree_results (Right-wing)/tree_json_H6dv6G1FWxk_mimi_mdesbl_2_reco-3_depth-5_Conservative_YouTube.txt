He shares five tips to try, whether you\u2019re at the start of your career or contemplating your next act.  \n\n\nExecutive director of Stanford\u2019s design program at the d.School, Bill Burnett uses design thinking, a career\u2019s worth of starting companies and coaching students, and a childhood spent drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother\u2019s sewing machine to inform his work on how to design your life. In five eyebrow-raising findings, Burnett offers simple but life-changing advice on designing the life you want, whether you are contemplating college or retirement. \n\nAfter years of drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother\u2019s sewing machine, Bill Burnett went to college where he discovered that there were people in the world who did this kind of thing every day (without the sewing machine), and they were called designers. Thirty years, five companies, and a couple thousand students later, Burnett is still drawing and building things, teaching others how to do the same, and quietly enjoying the fact that no one has discovered that he is having too much fun. As Executive Director of the Design Program at Stanford, he runs undergraduate and graduate programs in design, both interdepartmental programs between the mechanical engineering and art departments. Burnett worked on design of the award-winning Apple PowerBooks and the original Hasbro Star Wars action figures. He holds a number of mechanical and design patents.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB\n\nJosh Kaufman is the author of the #1 international bestseller, 'The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business', as well as the upcoming book 'The First 20 Hours: Mastering the Toughest Part of Learning Anything.' Josh specializes in teaching people from all walks of life how to master practical knowledge and skills. In his talk, he shares how having his first child inspired him to approach learning in a whole new way. \n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

It is by no means a kind of giving of money or material that we usually understand.\nIn 16 years, 76% of the total volume of freight traffic in China was a very important group for our truck drivers.But when Tumengy and his team got to know them, they found out that there are more than 6000 foundations in China that don't have a foundation that provides them with public service. The truck drivers had very low social status.It's even stigmatized -- \" road killer \", overloading, speeding.\nWhen Tumeng do the research and find that a lot of drivers had insurance on their cars and not insured themselves. It is a shock phenomenon A car is more expensive than its own.

                "description": "As a mathematician, Dr. Sujatha Ramdorai indulges the audience with her passion for algebra and number theory, the curious coincidence of nature and math and a personal journey back to doing what she loves. At an impasse in her life, an opportunity arises for deeper thought into abstract mathematics. The road to recovery involved discovering a new hobby which unbeknownst was an extension of her passion all along. She is an algebraic number theorist best known for her work on Iwasawa theory. She is a professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia, Canada. She was previously a professor at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Working with her husband Srinivasan Ramdorai and Indian mathematics writer V.S. Sastry, Sujatha Ramdorai conceived of and partially funded the Ramanujan Math Park in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh, which was inaugurated at the end of 2017. The park is dedicated to mathematics education and honours the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. Ramdorai became the first Indian to win the prestigious ICTP Ramanujan Prize in 2006. She was also awarded the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award, the highest honour in scientific fields by the Indian Government in 2004. She is also the recipient of the 2020 Krieger\u2013Nelson Prize for her exceptional contributions to mathematics research.

SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB\n\nJosh Kaufman is the author of the #1 international bestseller, 'The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business', as well as the upcoming book 'The First 20 Hours: Mastering the Toughest Part of Learning Anything.' Josh specializes in teaching people from all walks of life how to master practical knowledge and skills. In his talk, he shares how having his first child inspired him to approach learning in a whole new way. \n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

                    "description": "Speaker: Larry McEnerney (University of Chicago Writing Program)\n\nWhen graduate students envision themselves working outside academia, they often worry about writing.  This is sensible: academics who work outside academia are endlessly criticized for writing \"like a professor\".  Worse, writers who are criticized in this way are often baffled at how to adapt to their new world.  Very often, they try to change aspects of their writing that are not troublesome, and they leave in place aspects of their writing that are making their writing less clear, less logical, and less valuable to their readers. \n\nThis session will be about a few patterns of writing that are likely to aggravate non-academic readers.  We'll focus on patterns that are often difficult for academics to see, but are actually fairly easy to change.",
