Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/\n\nHey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles longest-running No.1 in the US singles chart as well as the single with the longest running time.  \n\nThe Beatles did not record their promotional film until Hey Jude had been on sale in America for a week. They returned to Twickenham Film Studio, using director Michael Lindsay-Hogg who had worked with them on Paperback Writer and Rain. Earlier still, Lindsay-Hogg had directed episodes of Ready Steady Go! And a few months after the film for Hey Jude he made The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special that featured John and Yoko but wouldn\u2019t be shown until 1996\n\nTo help with the filming an audience of around 300 local people, as well as some of the fans that gathered regularly outside Abbey Road Studios were brought in for the song\u2019s finale. Their presence had an unlikely upside for The Beatles in their long-running saga with the Musicians\u2019 Union in that the MU were fooled into believing the band were playing live, when in fact they were miming for the vast majority of the song. Paul, however, sang live throughout the song.\n\nThe video was first broadcast on David Frost\u2019s Frost On Sunday show, four days after it was filmed. At that point transmission was in black and white although the promo was originally shot in colour. It was first aired in America a month later on 6 October 1968, on The Smotheres Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nConnect with The Beatles:\nFacebook ",

He exited the forest, on the brink of death and still haunted by personal demons, to eventually gain a Ph.D., become a university lecturer in the Faculty of Business, Law, and Arts and become an ambassador for Australia\u2019s \u2018forgotten children\u2019. This incredible story is a personal testament to \u2018never giving up\u2019. Dr. Gregory P. Smith is a survivor, an academic, and a social researcher. Homeless for much of his adult life living as a recluse in a forest near Byron Bay, he now has a Ph.D. in Sociology and teaches at Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. In 2018 he published his memoir \u2018Out of the Forest\u2019 with Penguin Random House and has been the subject of two Australian documentaries. His profoundly touching and uplifting memoir is at once a unique insight into how far off track a life can go and a powerful reminder that we can all find our way back. Gregory is heavily involved in advocating for the vulnerable and disadvantaged and continues to be the patron of a number of charity organisations while also consulting with several specialist services and agencies. Currently, Dr. Smith is engaged as a consultant and program evaluator in the Premiers Priority Project to reduce rough sleeping in NSW, Australia by 50% in 2025 and zero by 2030. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

In 1990 I did interviews with 180 baby boomers talking about their early life during the 1960s for my television series, Making Sense of the Sixties. This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal. The last three were all awarded by the now-extinct government of the Republic of Vietnam.  He received the PUC and the two Vietnamese unit citations as a member of 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. You can find more at his website -www.wdehrhart.com. ",

Just like in life, there are no turn-by-turn directions when it comes to cancer research. Tyler Jacks shares the lessons he\u2019s learned, and what they mean for all of us.\n\nDr. Tyler Jacks, Ph.D. is the Director of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and a Daniel K. Ludwig Scholar. Over the course of his career at MIT, Dr. Jacks has pioneered the use of gene targeting technology to study cancer-associated genes and to construct models of many human cancer types, including cancers of the lung, brain, and ovary. His laboratory has made seminal contributions to the understanding of the effects of mutations of several common cancer-associated genes. This research has led to novel insights into tumor development, normal development, and other cellular processes, as well as new strategies for cancer detection and treatment.\n\nDr. Jacks has published more than 200 scientific papers and has served on the Board of Scientific Advisors of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is currently Chair of the National Cancer Advisory Board. He serves as an advisor to several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and is currently a member of the Board of Directors of Amgen and Thermo Fisher Scientific. In recognition of his contributions to cancer research. Dr. Jacks was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies in 2009 as well as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2012 and the inaugural class of Fellows of the American Association of Cancer Research Academy in 2013.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

Fried\n\n\nThe brain is arguably the most challenging system to study. Not only is it filled with complex networks of neurons, our tools were limited in their ability to match specific groups of neurons to specific brain functions. Now, neuroscientists have harnessed a genetic trick that takes a green algae protein and genetically expresses it in neurons, allowing these neurons to \u201csee light\u201d. Using fiber optics, neuroscientists can control the function of individual neurons and networks within the brain of living animals, providing an unprecedented ability to match form to function. From mind control to its therapeutic potential, join us to learn how optogenetics is paving the way for scientists to understand the fundamental mechanisms of the brain.",

One central problem is that brain function is based on a much more complicated cellular organization than found in any other part of the body. The brain contains billions of nerve cells and these are interconnected by trillions of synapses in a vast wiring diagram. This wiring diagram has not been described but likely contains the physical instantiations of all the brain does including all the memories we hold and all the skills we have learned. In addition such a wiring diagram may be disrupted when there are abnormalities in brain function such as learning disorders in children or psychiatric diseases in adults. In this lecture, Prof. Lichtman discusses how scientists are taking the first steps in imaging and understanding the wiring diagram of the brain.",

He is a world renown theoretical physicist and uses graphs to help demonstrate the theories he is presenting.\n\nString theory (with its close relative, M-theory) is the basis for the most ambitious theories of the physical world. It has profoundly influenced our understanding of gravity, cosmology, and particle physics. In this course we will develop the basic theoretical and mathematical ideas, including the string-theoretic origin of gravity, the theory of extra dimensions of space, the connection between strings and black holes, the \"landscape\" of string theory, and the holographic principle.\n\nThis course was originally presented in Stanford's Continuing Studies program.\n\nStanford University:",
