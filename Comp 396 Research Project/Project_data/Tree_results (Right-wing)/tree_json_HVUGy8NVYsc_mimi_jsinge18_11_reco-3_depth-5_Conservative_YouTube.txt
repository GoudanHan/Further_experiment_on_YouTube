Here you will find songs with soothing warm pianos and delightful violin melodies. Some of the tracks contain sounds of nature such as rain, waterfalls, and the seashore waves that decrease stress and anxiety. It is proven that calming background music with sustained sounds improves focus and boosts motivation. During long studies or work sessions, our radio will aid your endurance. Neoclassical tracks are famous for minimizing distractions while white noise present in these tunes optimizes concentration, reduces the learning curve and working time, and improves creativity and clarity. \n\nFor best results keep our music in the background to accord both sides of the brain, prepare to seize this day, and as always, enjoy the music!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Image author and inspirator \n Micha\u0142 Karcz\n https://www.behance.net/gallery/64984...\n https://www.deviantart.com/karezoid\n https://500px.com/p/karezoid?view=photos\n https://www.michalkarcz.com/copy-of-home\n\n\nWe have created a new channel and we really need your help.\n \ud83d\ude4f Please like, comment or subscribe.\nGenre: Ambient,  Drone, Modern Classical, Contemporary classical music\nStyle: Downtempo, Spacey Ambient\nMood: Inspiring, Peaceful, Night, Smooth, Calming, Soothing, Space, Nature\nDuration: 24/7\nFeature: Without Lyrics, No vocals\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 Similar videos\nEnergy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nFuture Garage \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nMusic Genres \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAll Music VIdeos \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nWork Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillout Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nStudy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nHacker Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAmbient Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillstep Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n\n #AmbientMusicLive #DroneMusicBackground #ContemporaryClassicalMusic",

A calm and beautiful selection of recordings I made for you during the past years. \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find more calm piano music also on my YT channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find my music is also on:\nSpotify:   \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailySpotify\n\nApple Music:    \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailyAppleMusic\n\nrelaxdaily Instagram:      \nhttps://www.instagram.com/relaxdaily/\n\nweb: https://relaxdaily.net\n\nI hope you enjoy the music and have a calm and wonderful day in your style, at your pace.\nMichael (relaxdaily)*\n\nFor new music videos (and 24/7 music streams) see: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily (tick the notification bell when subbing if you like to receive notifications on new music)\n\nThis relaxdaily project (= me creating calm music) can be nourished via Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/relaxdaily\n\n*If you\u2019re new to my music project: I\u2019m Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. \n\nI believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

So small towns are providing incentives for incomers - like rent-free homes in Campania or one euro house prices in Sicily.\n\nThe Italian countryside is full of hilly landscapes, breathtaking panoramas and picturesque hamlets. Yet small towns and villages are dying out. Lack of jobs and poor infrastructure are driving people to leave. In the coming years, some 2,500 places could become ghost towns, although the Coronavirus pandemic has slowed this development. \n\nDuring the strict lockdown, the Vittoria family from Naples decided to escape the confines of the big city. In the fall of 2020 they packed their belongings and moved to Teora in Campania. Here mayor Stefano Farina is trying to repopulate his small town by paying newcomers\u2018 rent for two years if they enroll their children in the local school. That\u2019s also enticed the Greenwoods to move from Manchester, in the UK, to Teora with their four children. The town has acquired some thirty new residents from around the world and ensured the survival of its school. \n\nSeven hundred kilometers to the south, Mussomeli in Sicily is selling abandoned homes in its old town for just one euro. Here, too, more than half of the buildings stand empty. The initiative has proved so successful an agency had to be founded to deal with prospective foreign buyers. They must commit to renovating the house within the next three years, but are not obliged to reside in Italy. Mussomeli is most concerned with saving its dilapidated town center.",
