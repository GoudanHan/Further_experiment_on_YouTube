The 89-year-old Korean War veteran lived in the same home almost 60 years, planting all the trees on the property that now stand tall.  His house, known as \"Skull Ranch,\" was well-known in the community. It was even used to film scenes for Nicholas Cage's new movie \"Pig\" that came out this year. \n\n\"They really enjoyed being here,\" Sudul said, referring to the film crew. \"I was going to tell them, 'well you can come back. I'll be here.'\" That attitude is why people in Estacada consider Sulul someone who loves giving back to the community. \n\nBut on July 31, just a couple weeks after the film came out, tragedy struck. Sudul said he was about to go to bed when he heard strange noises and went to see where they were coming from. \"So I got up, went around and opened the back door to the kitchen and the smoke was about four feet ... I just ran out the front door,\" Sudul said. \n\nRead more: ",

When Washington, D.C., attorney Brad Chase (Mark Valley) was relocated to Boston to keep an eye on senior Crane, Poole & Schmidt partner Denny Crane (William Shatner), he had no idea what he was getting into. Meanwhile, as Chase does his best to keep an eye on Crane, Alan Shore (James Spader) uses ethically questionable methods to win the cases that no one else will touch. A spin-off of the Emmy Award-winning legal drama The Practice, Boston Legal has also featured such respected actors as Candice Bergen, Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois, and John Larroquette.",

He has to stand his ground because if he runs the wild dogs will attack him; he also has to ensure that they don't get behind him, because once they surround him, he is in trouble. The dogs rely on their phenomenal stamina to tire their prey and the combined strength of the pack to bring the prey down. Fortunately two members of another species comes to his rescue.",

It summarizes probably everything at the best, and shows how you can build a very convincing story in only 2 minutes.\n\nWARNING: the term \"gay\" is used in this movie. Before everyone could feel offended and complain about it, it's worth mentioning that \"gay\" has several definitions. in this video, the correct meaning is: \"A gay object is brightly coloured and pretty to look at.\" (Collins Dictionary). It is obvious that the term \"gay\" used here does not refer to a \"homosexual person\".\n\nThis is a copyrighted material, which diffusion is allowed by its owner\nThis movie is a production of Universal Pictures & Imagine Entertainment, in association with Spyglass Entertainment and\nWild West Picture Show Productions (as Wild West Picture Show)",

Rapid vaccination during an epidemic is part of epidemic control. And it's what every other country has done with COVID-19 ... Restrictions plus rapid vaccines works\".\n\n\"I think that's actually something that's really healthy because the fear and the ignorance in the community surrounding this virus 18 months into the pandemic is pretty disturbing,\" Ms Panahi said.",

Overnight Saturday, strong winds pushed the blaze into the suburb of Thrakomakedones, where it burned homes.\n\nMore than 700 firefighters, including reinforcements from Cyprus, France and Israel, have been deployed to fight the blaze, assisted by the army and water-bombing aircraft.\n\nWildfires have erupted in many parts of the country amid Greece's worst heatwave in more than 30 years, tearing through tens of thousands of acres of forestland, destroying homes and businesses and killing animals.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",
