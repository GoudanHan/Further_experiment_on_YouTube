It was the first of The Leakey Foundation and the Baumann Foundation&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Being Human&rdquo; event series. Our speaker was Robert Sapolsky, a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University and a MacArthur &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; Fellow. He gave a fascinating and funny talk about human behavior and the ways we are the same as, and different from, other animals.\n\n\nYou can hear more from Dr. Sapolsky on the Inquiring Minds podcast. Host Indre Viskontas interviewed Sapolsky about his work and his thoughts on our prospects as a species. You can find Inquiring Minds on iTunes and at motherjones.com/inquiringminds\n\n\nThis episode is part of the Being Human initiative of The Leakey Foundation and the Baumann Foundation. leakeyfoundation.org/beinghuman",

Andrew Cuomo said Thursday a coronavirus outbreak in Long Island is \u201ctroubling\u201d as the infection has now spread to every county across the state, surging to 92,381 with 2,373 deaths.\n\nAt his daily news conference in Albany, Cuomo said it was the \u201ccruelest irony\u201d that China, where the pandemic began, is the leading producer of critically needed personal protective equipment.\n\nHe also said the state would provide assistance to businesses manufacture personal protective gear if possible \u2014 face masks, medical gowns, face shields and gloves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can, but people are still dying and that is hurtful and humbling and painful. Just painful,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cAnd this is a long time to be under that level of pain. What do you look like when you come out the other side, I don\u2019t know.\n\nCuomo said the COVID-19 outbreak isn\u2019t just hitting urban areas. The coronavirus has spread across the state, including in rural communities where there are \u201cmore cows than people,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s suburban areas. That\u2019s Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk. ... In many ways New York state is a microcosm of the United States.\u201d\n\nHe said Nassau County has 1,000 new cases while Suffolk County \u2014 home to the Hamptons \u2014 has 1,141 new cases. \u201cThat is troubling news.\u201d\n\nFor more coronavirus live updates:",
