For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nDuring the pandemic, the internet kept Americans going as much as highways and rails.\n\nNow, a $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed by the Senate on Tuesday is set to inject money into expanding broadband access and bring funding to other parts of the tech sector, including electric vehicles. At the same time, the bill includes new tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions, meant to help fund the bill\u2019s enormous price tag.\n\nThe bill still needs to be passed by the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Joe Biden.\n\nThe bill allocates about $75 billion of the roughly $1 trillion total to broadband, cybersecurity and electric vehicle charging station funding. The cryptocurrency tax reporting provision would raise about $28 billion to fund it, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated.\n\nHere are the ways the new infrastructure bill will impact the tech sector if it is passed by the House and signed into law.\n\nCrypto tax reporting\n\nOne of the most contested parts of the bill in its final days has been a pay-for provision that would place stricter tax-reporting requirements on cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nThe proposal was meant as a way to fund the hefty price of the bill but engendered fierce debate over potential unintended effects.\n\nThe provision aimed to levy stricter tax-reporting rules on cryptocurrency transactions, though industry leaders warned it would inadvertently include software developers as \u201cbrokers\u201d under the bill\u2019s language.\n\nA group of senators proposed an amendment to limit that definition and carve out such software makers from the new requirements. But another group of senators countered with an amendment maintaining a broader definition.\n\nOn Monday, senators said they made an agreement on the amendments, but that compromise was blocked once it went to the floor.\n\nThe House still has a chance to revise this portion of the bill, and the cryptocurrency industry is expected to lobby representatives to do so.\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who owns cryptocurrency and introduced the proposal limiting the broker definition, said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d ahead of the final vote Tuesday that if the expanded broker definition were passed, it would fall to the Treasury Department to write rules refining its impact.\n\nBroadband\n\nThe infrastructure bill will allocate $65 billion toward expanding access to internet services, also known as broadband. The pandemic highlighted the need for high-speed internet access as office-based workers and students began logging into work and school from home.\n\nIt also further illuminated stark disparities in internet access in rural areas and some low-income urban neighborhoods.\n\nThe funds include a $42.5 billion grant program to fund broadband deployment in areas with the least amount of coverage. Another $14 billion will help subsidize internet costs for low-income Americans, extending the emergency funds created by bills passed at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe new internet subsidy would give eligible Americans a discount of up to $30 a month, while they receive up to $50 today under the emergency program.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: ",

                    "description": "https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/n...\n\nNext generation sequencing allows DNA samples to be sequenced quickly and affordably. Learn how next gen sequencing works and get tips on preparing and running your samples. \n\nIn the past decade there has been an amazing change in the efficiency of DNA sequencing. Using traditional Sanger sequencing, the human genome project took 20 years and cost $3 billion. Current next generation sequencing methods allow a human genome to be sequenced for $1000, in 48 hours!  In this talk, Eric Chow explains the chemistry behind next generation sequencing, and describes how the next gen sequencers detect and display results. The most commonly used Illumina sequencers are image based and detect the addition of fluorescently labelled nucleotides. Chow also describes two different next generation sequencing technologies which provide benefits such as much longer reads but with downsides such as higher error rates. Chow finishes the talk with some insights into medical applications of next gen sequencing such as much less invasive prenatal testing or cancer detection.  \n\nIn two short how-to videos, Chow gives advice on purifying DNA samples using magnetic beads and on determining the quality of your nucleic acid sample using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.\n\nSpeaker Biography:\nEric Chow is an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and the Director of the Center for Advanced Technology (CAT) at the University of California, San Francisco.  The CAT provides resources for UCSF labs wishing to use next generation sequencing techniques and Chow\u2019s research program strives to develop new applications for NGS in pathogen diagnostics.  Chow received his BA in molecular biology from the University of California, Berkeley and his PhD in biochemistry from UCSF.",

Libertarians argue that government shouldnt have the power to enact laws that 1) protect people from themselves, such as seat belt laws, 2) impose some peoples moral values on society as a whole, or 3) redistribute income from the rich to the poor. Sandel explains the libertarian notion that redistributive taxation is akin to forced labor with references to Bill Gates and Michael Jordan. \n\nPART TWO:  WHO OWNS ME?\n\nLibertarian philosopher Robert Nozick makes the case that taxing the wealthy\u2014to pay for housing, health care, and education for the poor\u2014is a form of coercion.  Students first discuss the arguments behind redistributive taxation. Dont most poor people need the social services they receive in order to survive?  If you live in a society that has a system of progressive taxation, arent you obligated to pay your taxes?  Dont many rich people often acquire their wealth through sheer luck or family fortune?  A group of students dubbed Team Libertarian volunteers to defend the libertarian philosophy against these objections.",

Professor Sandel asks students whether they consider this policy just.  Many do not, arguing that it is unfair to allow the affluent to avoid serving and risking their lives by paying less privileged citizens to fight in their place. This leads to a classroom debate about war and conscription.  Is todays voluntary army open to the same objection?  Should military service be allocated by the labor market or by conscription?  What role should patriotism play, and what are the obligations of citizenship?  Is there a civic duty to serve ones country? And are utilitarians and libertarians able to account for this duty?\n\nPART TWO:  MOTHERHOOD: FOR SALE\n\nIn this lecture, Professor Sandel examines the principle of free-market exchange in light of the contemporary controversy over reproductive rights.  Sandel begins with a humorous discussion of the business of egg and sperm donation.  He then describes the case of Baby M\"\u2014a famous legal battle in the mid-eighties that raised the unsettling question, Who owns a baby?\" In 1985, a woman named Mary Beth Whitehead signed a contract with a New Jersey couple, agreeing to be a surrogate mother in exchange for a fee of $10,000.  However, after giving birth, Ms. Whitehead decided she wanted to keep the child, and the case went to court. Sandel and students debate the nature of informed consent, the morality of selling a human life, and the meaning of maternal rights.",

                    "description": "Learn more: https://www.ibiology.org/talks/fluore...\n\nLive cell imaging has been revolutionized by the discovery of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). This lecture covers the history of GFP, how it folds and becomes fluorescent, how it has been mutated to produce additional colors (blue, cyan, yellow), and the discovery of red fluorescent proteins from corals. It also covers novel photoswitchable and photoactivatible fluorescent proteins, whose color can be changed by light, and new infrared fluorescent proteins.",

                    "description": "Visit www.radtechbootcamp.com today to view the entire Radiation Units of Measurement video series and more!\n\nRadiation Units and Measurements\n\nMeasuring radiation can be complicated. \n\n\u2022 Radiation has no mass or volume.\n\u2022 It has no charge.\n\u2022 And it travels at the speed of light, so you can\u2019t exactly put it in a box and measure it with a ruler. \n\nRadiation has no physical dimensions, so it cannot be measured directly. Instead, we quantify radiation in the context of three categories:\n\n\u2022 Radiation in air\n\u2022 Radiation in tissue (\u201cdose\u201d)\n\u2022 Radiation effects in tissue (\u201cbiological dose\u201d)\n\nThe focus of this lesson is radiation measurements in air. \n\nThe traditional way of quantifying radiation in air is by measuring the \u201cExposure\u201d.  \n\n\u2022 Exposure is a measure of the number of ions created in air by radiation. We can\u2019t directly count the number of photons, but we can count the number of ions created by those photons. \n\u2022 The traditional unit for measuring exposure is the Roentgen, which equals 2.58 x 10-4 C/kg.  \n\u2022 There is no special unit in the SI system, so we just measure exposure as Coulombs per kilogram (C/kg). \n\nSo what is a coulomb and why do we care how many coulombs are created in air? \n\n\u2022 One coulomb is equal to 6.242\u00d71018 ionizations. Remember, ionization is what happens when an x-ray photon separates an electron from an atom and creates two charged particles.    \n\u2022 So if a radiation source produces an exposure of 1 C/kg, that means it\u2019s producing 6.242\u00d71018 ionizations per kilogram of air. \n\u2022 1 C/kg and 1 Roentgen are both very large exposures, so in medical imaging, it\u2019s more common to see exposures of milliroentgen (mR) and micro coulombs per kilogram (\u00b5C/kg). \n\nThere is another way to measure radiation in air. \n\nThis is a measurement called Air KERMA. \n\n\u2022 KERMA is actually an acronym that stands for Kinetic Energy Released per unit Mass.\n\u2022 While exposure measures the number of ions created, air KERMA measures the total energy of those ions in air.\n\u2022 The unit used to quantify air kerma is the gray (Gy), which is equal to one joule per kilogram (J/kg). \n\u2022 That makes sense because kerma is the kinetic energy (joule) released per unit mass (kg). \n\u2022 1 Gray is a very large air kerma, so it\u2019s actually more common in medical imaging to see air kerma values expressed in milligray (mGy). \n\nExposure and air KERMA both can be used to define the \u201cintensity\u201d of the beam. Anything that affects the intensity of the beam also affects the measurement of radiation in air:\n\n\u2022 Increasing mAs increases exposure and air kerma\n\u2022 Increasing kVp increases exposure and air kerma\n\u2022 Increasing filtration decreases exposure and air kerma \n\u2022 Increasing distance decreases exposure and air kerma \n\nSo when would do we actually use these measurements in practice? \n\n\u2022 Medical physicists perform multiple exposure tests each year to make sure the x-ray machine is functioning properly. \n\u2022 This includes an exposure reproducibility test, which checks the ability of an x-ray tube to produce the same radiation exposure (intensity) with the same exposure settings. For example, if a technique of 70 kVp and 10 mAs produce an air kerma of 10 mGy, the physicist should get the same air kerma if the repeat the same exposure with the same technical settings. \n\u2022 This also includes an exposure linearity test, which checks to ensure that air kerma (mGy) or exposure (mR) increases linearly with increases in mAs. For example, if the physicist doubles the mAs, the air kerma (mGy) and exposure (mR) should also double. If the physicist reduces the mAs by half, the air kerma (mGy) and exposure (mR) should also decrease by half. \n\nThese tests are important to make sure the x-ray machines are producing just the right amount of radiation for the exam being performed. This ensures that patients are not being over-exposed and that the image receptors are not being under-exposed. \n\nHere\u2019s a table summarizing the measurements and units used for quantifying radiation in air.\n\nMeasurement Traditional Unit SI Unit Value\nExposure Roentgen (R) Coulombs per Kilogram (C/kg) Number of ions\nAir Kerma --- Gray (Gy) Energy of ions\n\n\u2022 Exposure refers to the measure of ionization created in air by radiation. The traditional unit for this the Roentgen, but the SI unit (and the unit used on the ARRT registry) is simply C/kg. \n\u2022 Air KERMA refers to the energy of ions created in air. The SI unit representing air KERMA is Gy.",

These rights\u2014to life, liberty and property\u2014were given to us as human beings in the the state of nature, a time before government and laws were created.  According to Locke, our natural rights are governed by the law of nature, known by reason, which says that we can neither give them up nor take them away from anyone else.  Sandel wraps up the lecture by raising a question:  what happens to our natural rights once we enter society and consent to a system of laws?\n\nPART TWO:  CONSENTING ADULTS\n\nIf we all have unalienable rights to life, liberty, and property, how can a government enforce tax laws passed by the representatives of a mere majority? Doesnt that amount to taking some peoples property without their consent? Lockes response is that we give our tacit consent to obey the tax laws passed by a majority when we choose to live in a society. Therefore, taxation is legitimate and compatible with individual rights, as long as it applies to everyone and does not arbitrarily single anyone out.",

How fast a reaction goes depends on the kinetics. Decomposition of a molecule might be thermodynamically favorable (the molecule is unstable) but kinetically slow (the molecule is inert). In thinking about chemical reactions, rate matters. This lecture provides an introduction to kinetics and shows one of the coolest reactions known: the oscillating clock reaction. Watch as colors change quickly as different steps in the reaction become spontaneous.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at ",
