He has become a hero to hundreds of public and private sector organizations for his indispensable counsel and strategic insight on safeguarding information systems and combating cyber-fraud.\n\nWith an eye on the latest techniques developed by high-tech criminals to deceive and defraud, Frank leaves audiences with a deep understanding of today\u2019s evolving security landscape, and more importantly, a vision of how to make the world a safer place.",

I'm sure this run can be further optimized but I think we are reaching the upper limits of this category. Maybe glitchless % will gain some more popularity",

These surprising tactics\u2014which radically diverge from conventional negotiating strategy\u2014weren\u2019t cooked up in a classroom, but are the field-tested tools FBI agents used to talk criminals and hostage-takers around the world into (or out of) just about any scenario you can imagine. \n\nIn NEVER SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It, former FBI lead international kidnapping negotiator Chris Voss breaks down these strategies so that anyone can use them in the workplace, in business, or at home.\n\nThis talk was moderated by Mairin Chesney.",

He rated undercover scenes in movies for realism, such as Martin Scorsese's \"The Departed\" and Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs.\"\n\nHe also rated scenes in movies and shows featuring undercover surveillance work, such as \"The Bourne Ultimatum,\" and characters going undercover in \"Argo,\" \"Lethal Weapon,\" and the US version of \"The Office.\" Woods relayed anecdotes of his time as an undercover policeman and the dangers involved in the role.\n\nWoods is now a board member of the Law Enforcement Action Partnership, an American nonprofit organization seeking to overhaul current punitive drug policies and lessen the incidences of crime and addiction. \n\nWoods is co-author of \"Good Cop, Bad War\" with JS Rafaeli, and author of \"Drug Wars: The Terrifying Inside Story of Britain's Drug Trade.\"\n\nFor more, visit: ",
