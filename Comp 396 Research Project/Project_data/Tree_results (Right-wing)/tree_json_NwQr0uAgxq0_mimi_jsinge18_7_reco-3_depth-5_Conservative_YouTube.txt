It's called methane. \n\n\u201cThis newer scarier gas is produced from shale gas wells, poorly managed conventional oil and gas extraction, and methane comes from the farming of animals.\n\n\u201cThat's right, the latest villain in the climate cult's never-ending scare campaign are cows and sheep. I mean forget about China who are building more and more coal-fired power plants.\u201d\n\nMr Dean said he learnt this week that emissions from cows on New Zealand dairy farms have reached record levels.\n\n\u201cData from Stats NZ, just released for the years 2007-2019, shows dairy emissions from the climate socialist paradise of saint Jacinda Ardern rose by 3.18 per cent in 2019, to a total of 17,719 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou'll remember when a couple of years ago Jacinda Ardern had the nerve to lecture Australia on our emissions. \n\n\u201cSo imagine my surprise to see this graph which shows that between 1990 and 2018 New Zealand's emissions rose by 57 per cent \u2013 the second greatest increase of all industrialised countries \u2013 at the same time as Australia's fell by 13 per cent. \n\n\u201cBut you watch \u2013 when the IPCC report is published this week, all the climate hysteria will be focused not on the hypocritical Ardern, but it will all be about the terrible climate change scary monster called Australia and the evils of mining coal.\u201d",

Rapid vaccination during an epidemic is part of epidemic control. And it's what every other country has done with COVID-19 ... Restrictions plus rapid vaccines works\".\n\n\"I think that's actually something that's really healthy because the fear and the ignorance in the community surrounding this virus 18 months into the pandemic is pretty disturbing,\" Ms Panahi said.",

I have had attempts on my life and I have too much work to do there, too many people that need help right now for me to allow that,\"Ms Bush told CBS news.\n\n\"So, if I end up spending $200,000, if I spend 10 more dollars on it -- you know what? I get to be here to do the work. So suck it up and defunding the police has to happen, we need to defund the police and put that money into social safety nets.\"\n\nThe outspoken progressive has been accused of hypocrisy after hiring security but being an avowed supporter of defunding the police in her distict, which is enduring a spike in crime.\n\nCrime rates have been skyrocketing in St. Louis, which is where Ms Bush's seat in Congress is located\n\nThe FBI has deemed St. Louis is the fourth most dangerous city in the US.",

If you're watching on your phone, you can control what part you see just by moving your phone around. **\n\n\"Modern Times\" is one of my favorite Charlie Chaplin movies, and for years I've wanted to find the spot at the end of the movie where we see Chaplin and Paulette Goddard head off into their less than certain future. \n\nTurns out, this scene was shot in the Palmdale/Santa Clarita near Agua Dulce - just a short detour out of my way on a recent trip home from Los Angeles. So I stopped and captured a little of the magic Charlie and Paulette created 84 years ago.\n\nMusic: Spencer Day (\"Spencer Day: Smile (Charlie Chaplin cover)\") ",

This event was added to make the Games as close as gender-neutral as possible, so this was a historic first podium for Canada to be a part of. The 2021 Olympics baseball tournament wrapped up, and there was some very emotional moments in the South Korea vs. Dominican Republic bronze medal game. More events wrapped up: Kevin Durant helped Team USA to gold in men's basketball, Nelly Korda made it double-gold for USA in golf alongside Xander Schauffele, and Tom Daley and his knitting won him a fourth Olympic medal.  \n\nSubscribe to CBC Sports: ",
