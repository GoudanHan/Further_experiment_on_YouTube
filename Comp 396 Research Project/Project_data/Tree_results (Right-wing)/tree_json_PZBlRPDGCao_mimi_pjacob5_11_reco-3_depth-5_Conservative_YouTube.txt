Journey with us through a series of musical postcards, each selection a glimpse into the lives of composers in search of home. By journey\u2019s end, you might discover that home is not the place you thought it was, or even a place at all\n\n\nWith support from: \nDuo Beija-Flor - In partnership with Prairie Debut and the National Arts Centre",
