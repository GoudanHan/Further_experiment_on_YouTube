                    "description": "Bird Song - David Young\n\nTwo days ago I saw a meme, and the meme called to me. I promised my f(r)iends that I would bring the music of the birds to life, and with this video, I fulfill that promise.\nShoutout to Wild Green Memes for Ecological Fiends - thanks all for your support!\n\nI started by transcribing the birds in the photo onto a 5-line staff. In many cases the birds didn't fit cleanly onto one line or into one space, so I just made some decisions. I could have made different decisions, and the music would have been different. So it goes.\nThen I picked 4/4 as a workable time signature, assigned some rhythms and grouped some notes into chords, and plopped a treble clef onto there.\nAfter noodling around on the keyboard for a bit, I picked a key signature, and decided to allow myself to shift notes to any octave and add any number of additional notes.\nComposing the piece then took... a long time... and then I popped it all into Dorico (my notation software of choice). The audio is generated through Dorico. I thought about playing it myself, but my piano skills are okay, but... not \"learn something in a few hours and then record it and feel super happy about it\" good.\nI hope you enjoy! If you liked it, I'd be much obliged if you pressed that like button (it's oh-so-smooth from any direction) and subscribed. Let me know in the comments what you would like me to do next!\n\nThis music was written, and the video was produced, on ancestral lands of the Osage and Shawnee peoples.\n\u00a9 2021 King Avenue Music",
