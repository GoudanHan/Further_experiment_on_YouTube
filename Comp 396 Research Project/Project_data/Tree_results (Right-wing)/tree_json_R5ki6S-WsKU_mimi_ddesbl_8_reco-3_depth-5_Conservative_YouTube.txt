Luther was born into a world governed by the Roman Church and a distant emperor.\n\nHe managed to awaken a national spirit in Germans and become someone they identified with. \u2018Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\u2019 was what the territories in central Europe were called in the 15th century. It was the era of the Habsburg ruler Charles V, who saw himself as ruler by God\u2019s grace and defender of Christian unity. In 1521, he said that the sun never set in his empire, which stretched from Latin America in the west to central Europe and to the Philippines in the east. The German territories were just one of his realms, and powerful princes defended their own interests here. Secular and religious power was still based on the Christianity of the Roman church. But many saw the Reformation as an opportunity to distance themselves from Rome and the Emperor, and to improve their standing in the political power structure of the day. Unlike the Habsburg emperor Charles V, who didn\u2019t even speak German, Luther grew to become someone the people identified with, and he became hugely popular. The reformer was one of the first major figures to explicitly play the German card and appeal to national sentiment: one of his missives said, \"Why should the Germans put up with robbery and oppression imposed by foreigners?\u201d Luther\u2019s translation of the Bible into German was an important step in forming a German identity, but the Reformation left Germany divided along religious lines.\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

But what was the catalyst for it, what is the \"Renaissance factor\"? The Renaissance is an epoch unique in human history: Never before have art, culture, economics and science developed so rapidly within a single century. We search for the \"Renaissance factor\", that combination of influences that triggered a pivotal period in history. It is a journey through time from Ancient Rome to the Crusades and the Black Death in the 14th century, events that defined the developments of the Renaissance. We travel with Michelangelo to the major construction site that was to become St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, to the banking houses of the Medicis and the workshop of Johannes Gutenberg. We examine some of the many innovations of the Renaissance such as linear perspective, the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping. We ask what these achievements mean to us today and how - almost half a millennium later - we continue to benefit from the \"Renaissance factor.\" And we delve deeper with the help of spectacular reenactments and our \"special investigators\" - modern-day trendsetters, scientists, business tycoons, fashion designers and artists.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In this talk he discusses \"My Romance with the Warped Side of the Universe: from Black Holes and Wormholes to Time Travel and Gravitational Waves\".\n\nKip is a world-leading expert on the implications of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, from time travel to wormholes, and from black holes to gravitational waves. Until 2009 he was the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech, but has since retired to take up a new career in writing, and collaborations between science and art. He was executive producer and scientific adviser on Interstellar, the 2014 blockbuster film. One of Kip's key contributions was the visualisation of black holes and their surroundings, which contributed to the film winning an Oscar for \"Best Visual Effects\". Kip explained the science in the film in his 2014 book The Science of Interstellar. His many other multimedia projects have cemented his reputation to be able to explain complex concepts in ways that everyone can understand.\n\nAs one of the founders of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory), Kip was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves, along with Rainer Weiss and Barry C. Barish. The first detection of gravitational waves by LIGO (of which Cardiff University is a member) in 2015 confirmed a key part of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, and observations have continued to test one of science's most famous theories.",

Check out the Intelligence Squared website to hear about future live events and podcasts: http://www.intelligencesquared.com \n__________________________\n\nFilmed at Church House on 27th October 2015.\nEvery industry has its guru. And when it comes to the dark arts of political statecraft, the American biographer Robert Caro is the mentor politicians turn to for guidance. His biography of President Lyndon B. Johnson has been described as \u2018the greatest insight into power ever written\u2019. Caro is revered by presidents and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US, his fans include Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Here in Britain, his life of LBJ is George Osborne\u2019s favourite political work and has been read by every MP and wonk in Westminster.\nOn October 27, Robert Caro made a rare appearance in London on the Intelligence Squared stage. He was joined by William Hague, the former foreign secretary and leader of the Conservative party, and himself an acclaimed political biographer. Hague quizzed Caro on the nature of political power. How is it built and preserved? Where does true political power lie? With our elected representatives, or shady figures behind the scenes? One of the most powerful operators ever, who never entered public office, is Robert Moses, the man who built modern New York City. Moses is the subject of Caro\u2019s Pulitzer-winning 1974 biography 'The Power Broker', now published in Britain for the first time. Described as \u2018a majestic, even Shakespearean, drama about the interplay of power and personality\u2019, the book offers unparalleled insight into the use and misuse of power.",

                "description": "Michael Worobey, Professor, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, The University of Arizona\n\nThe Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 was the most intense outbreak of disease in human history. It killed upwards of 50 million people (most in a six-week period) casting a long shadow of fear and mystery: nearly a century later, scientists have been unable to explain why, unlike all other influenza outbreaks, it killed young adults in huge numbers. I will describe how analyses of large numbers of influenza virus genomes are revealing the pathway traveled by the genes of this virus before it exploded in 1918. What emerges is a surprising tale with many players and plot lines, in which echoes of prior pandemics, imprinted in the immune responses of those alive in 1918, set the stage for the catastrophe. I will also discuss how resolving the mysteries of 1918 could help to prevent future pandemics and to control seasonal influenza, which quietly kills millions more every decade.",

He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance and wants to step in. But can this really ease inequality?\n\nChristoph Gr\u00f6ner does everything he can to drum up donations and convince the wealthy auction guests to raise their bids. The more the luxury watch for sale fetches, the more money there will be to pay for a new football field, or some extra tutoring, at a children's home. Christoph Gr\u00f6ner is one of the richest people in Germany - his company is now worth one billion euros, he tells us. For seven months, he let our cameras follow him - into board meetings, onto construction sites, through his daily life, and in his charity work. He knows that someone like him is an absolute exception in Germany. His parents were both teachers, and he still worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance. \"What we see here is total failure across the board,\u201d he says. \"It starts with parents who just don\u2019t get it and can\u2019t do anything right. And then there\u2019s an education policy that has opened the gates wide to the chaos we are experiencing today.\" Chistoph Gr\u00f6ner wants to step in where state institutions have failed. But can that really ease inequality? \n\nIn Germany, getting ahead depends more on where you come from than in most other industrialized countries, and social mobility is normally quite restricted. Those on top stay on top. The same goes for those at the bottom. A new study shows that Germany\u2019s rich and poor both increasingly stay amongst themselves, without ever intermingling with other social strata. Even the middle class is buckling under the mounting pressure of an unsecure future. \"Land of Inequality\" searches for answers as to why. We talk to families, an underpaid nurse, as well as leading researchers and analysts such as economic Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, sociologist Jutta Allmendinger or the economist Raj Chetty, who conducted a Stanford investigation into how the middle class is now arming itself to improve their children\u2019s outlooks.\n\nPart 1: ",

Why was Gandhi killed and what events occurred before and after Gandhi's murder? \n\nThis documentary shows how India was dogged by nationalism and religious conflict on its path to independence - and how these factors mark the country to this day. On 20 January 1948, Gopal Godse, a Hindu fanatic, attempted to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi. Ten days later, his brother Nathuram Godse managed to finish the job: he killed Gandhi. For Gopal Godse, India's Independence Day in August 1947 was a day of mourning. \"Bharat Mata,\" \"Mother India,\" which the young Brahmin zealously worshipped, had lost many of its provinces. Predominantly Muslim East Bengal had become East Pakistan, whilst western Punjab, the provinces of Sindh and Baluchistan and the land of the warlike Pashtuns made up West Pakistan a thousand miles away. This too was predominantly Muslim. Godse didn\u2019t just see the former colonial power, Great Britain, as responsible for the \"amputation,\" he also believed the Muslims were to blame. But, in Godse\u2019s eyes, the main culprit was a Hindu who was celebrated as a hero because he had defied the English, a small man with round wire glasses and a white cotton robe: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as \"Mahatma,\" the great soul. The Godse brothers did not care that Gandhi had always condemned conflict between the various religious communities and opposed the partition of India. They were members of the far-right Hindu Mahasabha, the \"Great Assembly of Hindus,\" which had close links with the anti-British and fascist National Volunteer Corps. And now extremist Hindus are gaining ground in India again...\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

                "description": "Germany is one of the world\u2019s richest countries, but inequality is on the rise. The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind. \n\nFor the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gr\u00f6ner, one of Germany\u2019s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. \"If you have great wealth, you can\u2019t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts. \"Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we\u2019re more independent,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanovi\u0107, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. \"These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,\" Milanovi\u0107 notes. \"Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?\u201d\n\nPart 1: ",

So, all this starts with home mortgages, and the use of mortgages as an investment instrument. For years, it seemed like the US housing market would go up and up. Like a bubble or something. It turns out it was a bubble. But not the good kind. And the government response was...interesting. Anyway, why are you reading this?

Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?\n\nThis documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI\u2019s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI\u2019s social implications?\n\nA documentary by Tilman Wolff und Ranga Yogeshwar \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Every second Euro in online trading is spent at Amazon. Is the IT giant, with its unabated growth, about to turn our economic system upside down?\n\nAmazon is a machine that can simultaneously observe, compare and analyze more than 300 million people worldwide. The company is not just a marketplace, market supervisor and provider of more and more services and consumer items - it also controls all the data streams in this market and uses them to its own benefit. Who suspects that a single click on an Amazon page will forward information to the company that fills a printed DIN-A-4 page? A conversation with Alexa, watching a streaming offer on Amazon-Prime, ordering vegetables via Amazon-Fresh - all this put together creates a whole library of information about every customer. The group collects everything - it just won\u2019t reveal what conclusions it draws from it. What would be possible if data from other, new business areas were added? In the USA, Amazon is also active in the health and insurance sectors, and police officers are using its facial recognition software to search for wanted persons.\n_______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "description": "Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market \u2013 the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? \n\nFor years, the world\u2019s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.\n\nThe fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it\u2019s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: \"This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more.\" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it\u2019s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It\u2019s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates.\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

I feel that after 7+ years of constant, ignorant comments, that it is better to simply shut it off.  I apologize to those who actually had thoughtful, intelligent exchanges in the comments.

This is perhaps the most fundamental question in all of science, and it may also be the most controversial.\n\n Albert Einstein was among the first to envision a unified theory that could account for the behavior of all matter and energy in the cosmos, but a definitive solution has eluded physicists to this day. As the 21st century progresses, \"string theory\" remains the leading candidate to be the \"theory of everything\"\u2014although some have come to question whether string theorists are on the right track. Still others doubt that a \"theory of everything\" exists at all\u2014and consider the search for such a theory an outdated philosophy of our search for cosmic truths.\n\n Join Director of the Hayden Planetarium Neil deGrasse Tyson as he hosts and moderates six of the world's leading voices in this great scientific debate.",

In this sobering talk, atmospheric scientist Brian Toon explains how even a small nuclear war could destroy all life on earth -- and what we can do to prevent it. A professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Brian Toon investigates the causes of the ozone hole, how volcanic eruptions alter the climate, how ancient Mars had flowing rivers, and the environmental impacts of nuclear war. He contributed to the U.N.\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize for climate change and holds numerous scientific awards, including two NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement. He is an avid woodworker. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

                    "description": "\"The Speech\" is what Ronald Reagan called it. Today we call it, \"A Time for Choosing,\" and it was a pivotal turning point in Ronald Reagan's life.\n\nRonald Reagan began a long side-career of public speaking as his acting career closed out. He traveled across the country meeting Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, Chambers of Commerce and any other civic-minded local groups. This continued and intensified during his service as the General Electric spokesperson while hosting their sponsored television series. \"The Speech\" was delivered in various forms and to different audiences as each word was honed, measured and memorized.\nDuring the 1964 Presidential campaign, Republican party officials in California, who knew Reagan's powerful message and delivery, asked him to film a speech on behalf of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater. The speech was aired on October 27, 1964 and it was electrifying. Donations to the Republican party and candidates increased dramatically.\n\nThe Republican Party took note and they targeted Reagan as a candidate from that point forward. He agreed in 1966 to run for Governor of California. He won two terms, and eventually won the Presidency.\n\nTable of Contents:",

However, while growth is slowing, the economy remains sound and the Chinese Communist Party emerged from the 19th Party Congress with its strongest leader in years. What makes experts forecast again and again that China is on the verge of collapse? Yukon Huang, former Country Director for China at the World Bank, cuts through the myths and joins us to discuss his new book, \"Cracking the China Conundrum: Why Conventional Economic Wisdom is Wrong.\" His in-depth analysis explores the varied dynamics at play in China\u2019s economic growth today and sheds light on why so many China watchers have gotten it wrong.\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nYukon Huang\nSenior Fellow, Asia Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nN.
