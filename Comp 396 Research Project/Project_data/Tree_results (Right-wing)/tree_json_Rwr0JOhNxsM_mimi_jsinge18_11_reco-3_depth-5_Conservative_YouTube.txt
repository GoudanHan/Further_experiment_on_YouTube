It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",
