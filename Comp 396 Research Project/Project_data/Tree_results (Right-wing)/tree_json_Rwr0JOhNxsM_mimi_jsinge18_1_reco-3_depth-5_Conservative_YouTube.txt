                "description": "No matter how fast you are, no one outruns their past. F9 is the ninth chapter in the Fast & Furious Saga, which has endured for two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world. Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he's going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they've ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom's forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, the upcoming The Suicide Squad). F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe-from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tbilisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before. The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar\u00ae winner Helen Mirren and Oscar\u00ae winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom's past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna. F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent.",

He becomes an intervention specialist and writes a book, \"Dying for Triplicate,\" detailing his journey into recovery. In a twist of fate, Todd is presented with an opportunity to help Bradley Nowell\u2019s son, Jakob, who at twenty-years old is battling his own addiction to drugs and alcohol.  \"As devastating as it was to lose our only son, the only thing that could be worse would be losing Jake, \" says Bradley\u2019s father, Jim \u201cPapa\" Nowell.

It's the story of what is at stake for all of them: all that can be won, and all that can be lost, when you go chasing glory at over two hundred miles an hour on a motorcycle. Nobody knows the ferocity of the competition better than Valentino Rossi. From 2001 to 2005, he won five MotoGP championships in a row. He was the undisputed king of the sport. But by 2010, Rossi had his hands full. The men who could beat him had arrived. The battles that raged from 2011 to 2013 generated the extremes of triumph and tragedy which mark out grand prix motorcycle racing not just as a sport for extreme athletes, but as an arena for true gladiators. There has never been a time like it in motorcycle sport and now, with both Marco Simoncelli and Casey Stoner gone, there never will be again. Hitting The Apex is the story of the fastest riders and the greatest years in motorcycle racing history.",

They're part of a convoy of Grand Prix motorcycle riders travelling across Western and Eastern Europe competing for the World Championship Road Racing title. Love, Speed and Loss is a love story set against the backdrop of 1970s Grand Prix racing. Kim Newcombe and his childhood sweetheart wife, Janeen, arrived in Berlin in 1969. Kim had a job working as an engineer for the Konig outboard marine company. Within a year he'd taken the outboard engine and turned it into a lightning-fast road racing motorbike that led the world championship. And so the couple's European adventure began. On route to Europe Janeen bought a Super8 camera in Hong Kong and started documenting the couple's new life. Love, Speed and Loss opens with Janeen watching the footage of her and Kim - young, in love and idealistic. The documentary moves between the 1970s and the present day as it reveals the couple's story, building toward the tragic event that saw Janeen's life change dramatically.",

                    "description": "A revealing and deeply personal documentary about the life of Sir Alex Ferguson, from his working-class roots in Glasgow through to his career as one of the greatest football managers of all time. While recovering from a traumatic brain haemorrhage in 2018, Sir Alex intimately recounts vivid details of his life and career to his son, including his legendary 26-year tenure as manager of Manchester United. Directed by Sir Alex's son, Jason Ferguson, this is a deeply moving story about the extraordinary power of memory. On 5th May 2018, Sir Alex Ferguson collapsed on the floor of his family home near Manchester, he was suffering from a brain haemorrhage that required emergency surgery. He remembers nothing of that day. Jason was by his side for most of it and, in those first moments after it happened, he had no idea if his dad would survive. In the weeks and months that followed, Jason decided to test his dad's memory and began to ask him questions about his life. And Alex remembered everything - every trophy, every defeat, and every player. On a personal level, he talked about his relationship with his own father and his upbringing in Govan, a tough neighbourhood in the shadow of Glasgow's shipyards on the River Clyde. As a young man he was an apprentice toolmaker before he dedicated his life to football and went on to have a successful career as a prolific goal-scorer at several Scottish clubs, including the team he supported as a boy, Rangers. After moving from playing to management, Alex showed his ambition as an uncompromising manager, guiding Aberdeen to numerous trophies domestically as he broke the age-old monopoly of the Glasgow clubs, Celtic and Rangers. On the biggest stage, he delivered the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Bayern Munich and Real Madrid en route. Following his success at Aberdeen he came south to Old Trafford. He arrived at a club sitting 19th in the league table and faced a testing few years as he rebuilt Manchester United from the bottom up, turning the club's fortunes around and leading United to over two decades of consistent success. Although he developed a reputation for ruthlessness, he was also seen as a father figure by some of his young players. Under Ferguson's guidance, Manchester United won a glittering array of trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions League titles. He has won more trophies than any other manager in the history of football. Alex Ferguson recounts all these career highlights while recovering from his brain surgery, with the love and support of his family. The film features candid interviews with Alex himself, his wife Cathy, his three sons, former colleagues and elite players including Eric Cantona, Ryan Giggs and Gordon Strachan, as well as the doctors who treated Alex after his brain haemorrhage. This is a film about the bond between a father and son, an exploration of leadership and mental toughness, and a celebration of one of football's greatest careers.",

These writers aren't radicals or even vegetarians (Schlosser admits that his favourite meal is a hamburger and fries), but they are crusaders when it comes to exposing problems and naming offenders. There are stories of heartbreak and outrage, but the film carefully channels these emotions towards opportunities for activism.
