Julia Grosso scored the winner, while keeper Stephanie Labb\u00e9 stood tall in Canada's wild 3-2 win over Sweden on penalty kicks to become Olympic champions. Team Canada's men's 4x100-metre relay team won bronze. Andre De Grasse, Aaron Brown, Jerome Blake, Brendon Rodney celebrated after winning bronze in the Men's 4 x 100m Relay Final during the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic games. Andre De Grasse ran down the field in his anchor leg of the 4x100m relay, finishing just behind Italy's gold and Great Britain's silver-winning teams. Canada's long distance runner Mohammed (Moh) Ahmed won the 5,000m silver, just behind Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei. Evan Dunfee of Richmond, B.C., surged into podium position on the final stretch to win bronze in the men's 50-kilometre race walk. \n\nSubscribe to CBC Sports: ",

And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020. \n\n\nArtist:                   Secret Garden\nAlbum:                Earthsongs\nTrack:                   Lotus\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "description": "Cancel Culture BACKFIRES On Antifa And BLM Leftists As Their Arrests Go Public, They Lose Their Jobs. Antifa and BLM Leftists are anxious and panicked now that people know they have been arrested for rioting in portland.\n\nJournalist Andy Ngo has been documenting arrests made by police in Portland and now the people arrested are facing karma. One man lost his job and while his employer claims it had nothing to do with the arrest an email they sent seems to contradict that.\n\nIt seems like for the longest time these people were acting with impunity mostly because the media shields or downplays their actions, calling them peaceful protests. Even in this regard they seem to be critical of Andy ngo just reporting on the arrests.",
