                        "description": "The personal and professional lives of Boston's most experienced litigators form the foundation of this prime-time comedy drama that has been nominated for multiple Emmy Awards since its 2004 premiere. When Washington, D.C., attorney Brad Chase (Mark Valley) was relocated to Boston to keep an eye on senior Crane, Poole & Schmidt partner Denny Crane (William Shatner), he had no idea what he was getting into. Meanwhile, as Chase does his best to keep an eye on Crane, Alan Shore (James Spader) uses ethically questionable methods to win the cases that no one else will touch. A spin-off of the Emmy Award-winning legal drama The Practice, Boston Legal has also featured such respected actors as Candice Bergen, Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois, and John Larroquette.",

                "description": "Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), devoid of bedside manner and dealing with his own constant physical pain, uses a cane that punctuates his acerbic, brutally honest demeanor. His behavior often borders on antisocial, but House is a brilliant diagnostician whose unconventional thinking and flawless instincts afford him a great deal of respect. An infectious disease specialist, he thrives on the challenge of solving medical puzzles in order to save lives. House shepherds an elite team of experts who help him unravel diagnostic mysteries. He has a confidant and good friend in oncology specialist Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), and maintains a somewhat volatile and undefined relationship with Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), the Dean of Medicine and hospital administrator. Though the two are in constant conflict over House's duties and unconventional behavior, even she would admit that his brilliance is worth the trouble.",

Foreman wants to give him hypertension medicine that is targeted to his race, but the patient refuses, believing that the establishment gives African Americans sub-standard medicine. Foreman gives him a prescription for the proper drug anyway.\n\nLater, the patient goes to see House, saying he didn't take Foreman's prescription. House wants to give him the same drug, but the patient insists on the same medicine white people get. House finally agrees to give him the same medicine Republicans get.\n\nSource: ",

Along with the acoustic guitar that plays throughout the song, V's humming and the harmonious sound of the violin in the latter part of the song truly stand out. Like the title \"Sweet Night\" suggests, it is a comforting track that wishes to gift the character, Park Sae Roy, who has had countless painful nights, only sweet nights in the future.\n\nV has been continually showcasing his musical talent through songs like \"4 O'CLOCK\", \"Scenery\" and \"Winter Bear\".\n\nReview from V (BTS)\nI first knew about \"ITAEWON CLASS\" through the webtoon years ago, and I remember having fun reading it while also learning valuable lessons. In particular, I really liked the character, Park Sae Roy, who left a deep impression on me, and I was very happy to see one of my favorite and close hyung playing this character. I am very thankful to be able to participate in this wonderful drama with my self-composed song. I hope many people will show this song lots of love.",

This January, Raylan confronts the Crowes, a deadly, lawless family from Florida intent on settling in Harlan with new criminal enterprises in mind. Meanwhile, 'Boyd Crowder' (Walton Goggins) struggles to free his imprisoned fianc\u00e9e 'Ava' (Joelle Carter) as he partners with the Dixie Mafia's 'Wynn Duffy' (Jere Burns).\n\nThe series co-stars Walton Goggins as 'Boyd Crowder;' Nick Searcy as Givens' longtime friend and boss 'Chief Deputy Art Mullen;' Jacob Pitts as 'Deputy Marshal Tim Gutterson;' Erica Tazel as 'Deputy Marshal Rachel Brooks;' Joelle Carter as 'Ava Crowder;' and Jere Burns as 'Wynn Duffy.' Yost wrote the pilot and serves as Executive Producer/Writer on the series. Executive Producers on the series include Carl Beverly, Sarah Timberman, Michael Dinner, Fred Golan, Dave Andron, Don Kurt, and the late Elmore Leonard, who passed away during the production of this season. Justified is produced by Sony Pictures Television and FX Productions.\n\nI do not own any rights to the footage, but absolutely love the show and just wanted to show a little glimpse of what makes the show so entertaining.",
