Equally disingenuous are the media attempts to excuse the super-spreader event on the basis that the virus doesn't go near \"sophisticated\" people.\n\n\u2014\n\nDinesh D'Souza is an author and filmmaker.  A graduate of Dartmouth College, he was a senior domestic policy analyst in the Reagan administration.  He also served as a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.  \n\nHe is the author of many bestselling books, including \"Illiberal Education,\" \"What's So Great About Christianity,\" \"America: Imagine a World Without Her,\" \"The Roots of Obama's Rage,\" \"Death of a Nation,\" and \"United States of Socialism.\"  \n\nHis documentary films \"2016: Obama's America,\" \"America,\" \"Hillary's America,\" \"Death of a Nation,\" and \"Trump Card\" are among the highest-grossing political documentaries of all time. He and his wife Debbie are also executive producers of the acclaimed feature film \"Infidel.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nWant to connect with Dinesh D'Souza online for more hard-hitting analysis of current events in America?
