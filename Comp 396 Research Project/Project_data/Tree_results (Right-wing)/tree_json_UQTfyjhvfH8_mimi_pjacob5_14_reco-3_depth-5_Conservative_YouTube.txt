Sit down and drink a cup of tea and feel this era. Soft nature sounds can help with insomnia, stress relief, sleep, meditation, and sleep disorders. For your sleep.\nIf you like the video, subscribe and like it. And I'd appreciate it if you could share it.\n============\nThe videos on my channel are made so that you can feel comfortable, happy and remind you of good memories. When I first make a video, I first think about the design, the atmosphere, and the place in the video, then I make the shapes one by one.\nSometimes the fireplace is made first, then rain on the windows, then the scenery outside the window is created, each creation is built step by step.\nSometimes it takes three days or sometimes even a week.\nWhat feelings do my videos on my channel give you?\nAre you comfortable? Are you reminded of any good memories?\nYour support will help me make other videos and share your happiness.\nOr share my channel with your friends.\nI will try my best to make better videos so that everyone can feel comfortable, happy and are reminded of their good memories.\nI hope everyone who reads this will always be happy.\nSincerely, The Relaxing Town\n\n===============\nSponsorship: ",

Sit down and drink a cup of tea and feel this era. Soft nature sounds can help with insomnia, stress relief, sleep, meditation, and sleep disorders. For your sleep.\nIf you like the video, subscribe and like it. And I'd appreciate it if you could share it.\n============\nThe videos on my channel are made so that you can feel comfortable, happy and remind you of good memories. When I first make a video, I first think about the design, the atmosphere, and the place in the video, then I make the shapes one by one.\nSometimes the fireplace is made first, then rain on the windows, then the scenery outside the window is created, each creation is built step by step.\nSometimes it takes three days or sometimes even a week.\nWhat feelings do my videos on my channel give you?\nAre you comfortable? Are you reminded of any good memories?\nYour support will help me make other videos and share your happiness.\nOr share my channel with your friends.\nI will try my best to make better videos so that everyone can feel comfortable, happy and are reminded of their good memories.\nI hope everyone who reads this will always be happy.\nSincerely, The Relaxing Town\n\n===============\nSponsorship: ",

        "description": "Ambient/drone radio for work or studying with stunning visuals\n\nThis radio features ambient and downtempo instrumental music commonly used to create a positive mood which indirectly boosts memory formation. Here you will find songs with soothing warm pianos and delightful violin melodies. Some of the tracks contain sounds of nature such as rain, waterfalls, and the seashore waves that decrease stress and anxiety. It is proven that calming background music with sustained sounds improves focus and boosts motivation. During long studies or work sessions, our radio will aid your endurance. Neoclassical tracks are famous for minimizing distractions while white noise present in these tunes optimizes concentration, reduces the learning curve and working time, and improves creativity and clarity. \n\nFor best results keep our music in the background to accord both sides of the brain, prepare to seize this day, and as always, enjoy the music!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Image author and inspirator \n Micha\u0142 Karcz\n https://www.behance.net/gallery/64984...\n https://www.deviantart.com/karezoid\n https://500px.com/p/karezoid?view=photos\n https://www.michalkarcz.com/copy-of-home\n\n\nWe have created a new channel and we really need your help.\n \ud83d\ude4f Please like, comment or subscribe.\nGenre: Ambient,  Drone, Modern Classical, Contemporary classical music\nStyle: Downtempo, Spacey Ambient\nMood: Inspiring, Peaceful, Night, Smooth, Calming, Soothing, Space, Nature\nDuration: 24/7\nFeature: Without Lyrics, No vocals\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 Similar videos\nEnergy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nFuture Garage \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nMusic Genres \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAll Music VIdeos \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nWork Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillout Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nStudy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nHacker Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAmbient Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillstep Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n\n #AmbientMusicLive #DroneMusicBackground #ContemporaryClassicalMusic",

                "description": "Chillout music radio 24/7 for your productivity while working from home. Excellent music tracks to keep you focused, motivated and relaxed at the same time. This music suits almost any type of work: whether you are a social media marketing specialist creating content for an Instagram page, or a big company boss solving daily issues. Cozy late-night work visuals will be a nice background in the \u201cwork with me\u201d style. Now it\u2019s a perfect time to propel your career to new heights. Have a nice productive work session! \n\nWork from home tips to maximize your productivity:\n\n1. Get ready for your workday. Our brains are programmed in a way that takes cues from our social and personal outlook while making a decision. When you dress up for your work, you give the brain a reason for doing it. It\u2019s like a natural alarm that can keep you alert throughout the day.\n2. Choose a proper home office. As much as home working is convenient for many as they can coop up in their bed or couch, it becomes challenging to resist the temptation of sleep with our not-so-healthy sleep routine. A dedicated workspace will enable you to keep yourself oriented to your work by providing an office-esque environment.\n3. Maintain consistent working hours. When your mind is completely onto work, it is quite possible for you to be unaware of the amount of time that has passed. If you plan on working for 8 hours straight on a workday, from 10 am to 6 pm, make sure you stick to your schedule.\n4. Eat & sleep right. One of the perks of working from home is free access to the kitchen. As soon as it is time for breaks, you gravitate towards it to grab some snacks. This practice does not benefit you, in any way. Being on a healthy diet is very essential when you are a working person. \n5. Set a morning & evening routine. Work on your sleep schedule, meditate and exercise regularly. \n6. Prepare a to-do list/planner. Creating a to-do list would allow you to keep track of your progress efficiently. \n7. Music can boost your productivity! Listen to your favorite playlists or music radios and stay focused.\nWe have created a new channel and we really need your help.\n \ud83d\ude4f Please like, comment or subscribe.\nGenre: Electronic music, Chillout music\nStyle: Chillout\nMood: Inspiring, Motivating, Calm, Night, Peacuful\nDuration: 24/7\nFeature: \n\n\ud83d\udcf9 Similar videos\nEnergy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nFuture Garage \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nMusic Genres \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAll Music VIdeos \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nWork Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillout Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nStudy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nHacker Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAmbient Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillstep Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n\n\n #WorkChillout #WorkRadio #NightMusic",
