Just subscribe and you are entered to win! \n\nCarlos Ghosn aka 'Le Cost Killer\" is the world-renowned CEO who brought Nissan back from the grave, along with other giants like Renault, Michelin, and Mitsubishi. But these days he is less known for his successes and more known for his financial scandals at Nissan that led to his arrest, and his eventual escape from Japan. Let's take a look at Ghosn's career and see if he truly is the criminal that the Japanese government is making him out to be, or if there really is a conspiracy behind his arrest. \n\nSubscribe to Albon here:",

They will have to submit to frequent Covid-19 testing, wear masks and socially distance themselves in the office. \u201cWe all want our lives to get back to normal, and fully vaccinated workplaces will make that happen more quickly and more successfully,\u201d Biden said last week. \u201cWe all know that in our gut: With incentives and mandates, we can make a huge difference and save a lot of lives.\u201d\n\nThis approach is what\u2019s known as a \u201csoft mandate,\u201d explains Dorit Reiss, a law professor who specializes in vaccine policy at the University of California Hastings Law School in San Francisco. Given the size and scope of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, universities and employers are facing the question of whether to require vaccinations, as well as the ethics of mandating a vaccine that has received \u201cemergency\u201d authorization but is not yet fully approved by the FDA. As the Delta variant complicates the return to \u201cnormal,\u201d many public and private institutions are adopting this two-tiered system separating the vaccinated from the unvaccinated. \u201cThere are consequences here,\u201d says Reiss, \u201cthey're just less harsh than \u2018get vaccinated or you're fired.\u2019\u201d ",
