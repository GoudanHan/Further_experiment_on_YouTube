Tesla held over 300 patents and is responsible for inventing the laser, x-ray, radio, Tesla coil, Tesla turbine, neon signs, induction motor, remote control and many more.

This is Jamyang. \n\nToday, I will take you to get a close look at the Tibetan Mastiff, a large breed of dog that can be found on the Tibetan Plateau, and now all around the world.\n\nIn Tibetan, the dogs are known as Drog-Khyi, which means \"nomad dog\", or \"dog which may be tied/kept\u201d.\n\nThe Tibetan Mastiff has been the loyal herd dog of the nomadic Tibetan herdsmen for thousands of years, protecting the herds and flocks from attacked by predators such as wolves, leopards, bears, and tigers.\n\nA full grown male dog can reach up to 33 inches in height, and can weigh between 45-70 kilograms. \n\nIn Tibet, there exists a strong bond between the nomads and their hugely protective dogs. \n\nAs pups, the dogs live together with the family, and as time passes a friendship takes root between the mastiff and the family members. \n\nFriendship and alliance is automatically understood by the mastiffs, as part of their natural instincts, and the bond that is forged between the dog and its family is unbreakable. \n\nWhile they are primarily a working dog, bred specifically to protect the herds and the family, Tibetan nomads take extremely good care of the animals, and they are well fed and well looked after by their families.\n\nI would like to share with you the story of Tibetan Mastiff, Dolma and its owner nearby Yamdrok Lake, and see how are their daily life. \n\nHope you will enjoy my video as usual. \n\nSubscribe: ",

You are willing to bet on your prepayment forecasts, but not on which way interest rates will move. Hedging lets you mitigate the extra risk, so that you only have to rely on being right about what you know. The trouble with hedging is that there are so many things that can happen over the 30 year life of a mortgage. Even if interest rates can do only two things each year, in 30 years there are over a billion interest rate scenarios. It would seem impossible to hedge against so many contingencies. The principle of dynamic hedging shows that it is enough to hedge yourself against the two things that can happen next year (which is far less onerous), provided that each following year you adjust the hedge to protect against what might occur one year after that. To illustrate the issue we reconsider the World Series problem from a previous lecture. Suppose you know the Yankees have a 60% chance of beating the Dodgers in each game and that you can bet any amount at 60:40 odds on individual games with other bookies. A naive fan is willing to bet on the Dodgers winning the whole Series at even odds. You have a 71% chance of winning a bet against the fan, but bad luck can cause you to lose anyway. What bets on individual games should you make with the bookies to lock in your expected profit from betting against the fan on the whole Series?",

Roberto Covolo, esperto di sviluppo del territorio, ha visto nel degrado una opportunit\u00e0 di creativit\u00e0. Grazie a nuove idee, all'innovazione sociale e al coinvolgimento delle istituzioni locali, enfatizza la possibilit\u00e0 di rigenerare e dare nuova vita a luoghi che solo apparentemente non hanno pi\u00f9 un'anima. Numerosi sono i progetti portati avanti che dimostrano l'impatto positivo non solo sulle comunit\u00e0, ma anche sull'economia e sull'ambiente.\n\n\nIn Italy the number of abandoned public places is unfortunately increasing. Roberto Covolo, expert of local development, explains how it is possible to create an opportunity for creativity out of deterioration. Talking from his own experience in different projects, he explains how impactful it can be to implement innovative ideas to give another life to these places that only aesthetically seems to be dead. The impact is measurable not only on a social level, but environmentally and economically as well.  Born in 1978, activist, sociologist, social entrepreneur, policy designer. \nHe worked for the Region of Puglia for the youth policy program 'Bollenti Spiriti'.   \nHe has been councillor of the Municipality of Terlizzi (Ba) where he promoted the recovery of an old abandoned slaughterhouse to create the MAT, a social and cultural center. He has been councillor of the Municipality of Brindisi where he promoted the programs Palazzo Guerrieri - Laboratorio di Innovazione Urbana, Riusa Brindisi and Parchi Bene Comune. \nHe has been working since 2011 in San Vito dei Normanni (Br) promoting the birth of social enterprises active in the valorization of abandoned properties including the Urban Laboratory ExFadda (born from the recovery of a former abandoned wine factory), the social restaurant XFOOD for the social inclusion of disabled people and the agro-ecological and social company XFARM (born from the recovery of land confiscated from the Mafia). This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",
