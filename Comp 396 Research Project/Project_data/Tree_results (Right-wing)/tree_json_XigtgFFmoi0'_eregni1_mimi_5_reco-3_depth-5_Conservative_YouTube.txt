Announcer Warren Beatty incorrectly named La La Land as the Best Picture winner, and the mistake wasn't revealed until crew members had already started giving their acceptance speeches. A lot of things went wrong for the snafu to happen the way it did. But what if typography was one of them? A better announcement card design could have made for a very different Academy Awards show \u2014 not to mention a much less embarrassing Miss Universe show for Steve Harvey back in 2015. But the implications of bad typography don't end there: poorly designed ballots in the 2000 presidential election arguably could have swayed the outcome, and illegible type on medicine bottles could be causing nearly 500,000 cases of drug misuse per year in the U.S. \n\nSubscribe to our channel!

                    "description": "Single Malt whisky is one of the most revered spirits in the world. It is exclusively made from barley, which is quite a cheap product. A bottle of The Macallan 1926 60-year-old recently sold for $1,512,000 in auction, marking the largest single sale ever for a bottle. Over the past 50 years, single malts have become increasingly popular. Scottish single malt exports grew by 14.2% in 2017 to reach nearly $1.5 billion.\n\nGlenfiddich distillery in Scotland is the world's largest exporter of single malt. Started in Dufftown in 1886, it ships 1.2 million 9-liter cases each year. \n\nMaking single malt is a difficult and lengthy process. Barley is ground down and added to spring water. Heated to 64\u00b0C, it turns to sugar, dissolving into a fine sweet, tangy liquid called wort. The wort is drained, cooled, and passed into wash-backs. This is heated and condensed in copper wash stills for its first distillation, and a second time in spirit stills. This spirit trickles into the spirit safe, ready for maturation, and then is batched in casks with spring water. Casks spend years in the warehouse, maturing into a single malt. \n\nAn aged 30-year maturation can have 30% to 40% of the alcohol evaporated in the barrel, or over 1% each year of the whisky\u2019s life. This is because of \"Angel's Share\" \u2014 the natural evaporation of the liquid into the atmosphere over time. So older whiskies are expensive not because they\u2019re old, but because they are rare. \n\nFashion, and the collector's market, also have something to do with the rise in popularity. Christie's Director of Wine Tim Tiptree oversaw the sale in 2018 of The Macallan 1926 60-Year-Old, which sold for $1,512,000 to a private buyer. According to Tim, the collector's market will continue to grow. \n\nIndia, China, and Japan, are now main players in the single malt market. Particularly successful is the Yamazaki distillery in Osaka prefecture. Rare whiskies from their collection of single malts now sell for thousands of dollars. \n\nWe tried a 12 year-old single malt worth $36, and the 50 year-old bottle worth $30,000.\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE CONTENT:\nWhy Foie Gras Is So Expensive | So Expensive",

                    "description": "A small percentage of sperm whales produce ambergris, a clump of squid beaks and fatty secretions that scientists believe exits through the whales\u2019 bowels Ambergris is coveted by the fragrance industry for a chemical it contains called ambrien, which suspends smells in the air, and for its own unique scent Quality pieces of ambergris, which ambergris hunters snatch up as they wash ashore, can garner more than $7,000 a pound.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nThis is ambergris. It might look like a rock, but it\u2019s actually a rare kind of whale poop. And it\u2019s not cheap. Per gram, ambergris can cost more than silver\u201430 times more. If you\u2019ve ever worn perfume, well, I\u2019ve got some unsettling news. You may have misted yourself with animal waste. You see, for centuries, perfumers have been using ambergris to enhance their fragrances. Ambergris is essentially a clump of squid beaks bound by a fatty secretion. Over time, it balls up in the intestine of some sperm whales. And eventually \u2026. Out it goes. Now, in the strictest sense it\u2019s not poop, but scientists think it likely exits the same way.\n\nChristopher Kemp: \u201cOne way or another, a big boulder of ambergris is released into the ocean and then floats for decades, or who knows how long.\u201d \n\nIn that time, the mass transforms from a sticky, dung-like substance into a hard, gray chunk. And this is what perfumers covet. For one, it contains a unique chemical called ambrein. It\u2019s a fixative, which means it makes other smells in perfume last longer. But ambergris is also valued for something \u2026 more surprising: it\u2019s smell. \n\nChristopher Kemp: \u201cIt\u2019s a bouquet of 20-30 chemical compounds that each have their own odor profile. One will smell sort of like mushrooms, one will smell a little bit like tobacco, one smells sort of like poop, one smells sort of like grass and hay.\u201d\n\nSounds enticing, right? Apparently. Perfume designers use strong scents like these for the base note in their fragrances. And Base notes form the foundation of any perfume. They\u2019re typically heavier, muskier smells, like what you get from a beaver\u2019s castor sacs or \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 ambergris. Roja Parfums, for example, has several expensive perfumes with base notes of ambergris like those in the Profumi D\u2019Amore collection. They sell for around $500 a bottle and are described as a \u201cpassionate love letter in fragrant form.\u201d And while ambergris has all the makings for a great perfume, what really drives up the price tag is how rare it is. Scientists don\u2019t know exactly why, but only about one percent of sperm whales produce the substance. In fact, researchers like Shane Gero who spend years studying sperm whales never see it.\n\nDr. Shane Gero: \u201cI\u2019ve been collecting sperm whale poop for 15 to 16 years, but I haven\u2019t collected anything that looks like ambergris.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, lucky beachgoers will stumble upon it. In 2006, for example, a couple picked up a 32-pound piece on a beach in Australia. Media outlets later reported it could be worth nearly $300,000. But more often, ambergris hunters will get to it first. They track weather patterns and ocean currents to predict where it might end up. And once they find it, they sell it to brokers or perfumers for up to $7,200 a pound. \n\nChristopher Kemp: \u201cThis is like gold to them. This is a real commodity. So they take it very seriously. They can be a bit aggressive, muscular and they really guard their secrets.\u201d\n\nBut the commodity\u2019s high price isn\u2019t the only reason they do it. In some countries like the U.S., buying, selling, or even collecting ambergris is illegal. That\u2019s because sperm whales are an internationally threatened species. \n\nDr. Shane Gero: \u201cBefore whaling started there were over a million sperm whales, and now we're down closer to a fifth of that.\u201d\n\nAnd while no whales are harmed in the collection of ambergris, Gero says it\u2019s never a good idea to buy or sell products from an endangered species. But until we can replicate something that smells as good as whale poop, we probably will.\n\n------------------------------------------------------",

M\u0101nuka, in fact, is a Maori word.\n\n\"The plant itself is very rare. It's difficult to harvest because the flower is only open for 12 days, and sometimes we have to use helicopters to collect this honey.\" John Rawcliffe from the M\u0101nuka Factor Honey Association told Business Insider.\n\nAlthough m\u0101nuka bushes can also be found in Australia, New Zealand accounts for almost all the world's production, with exports worth 300 million NZ dollars ($204m) and expected to rise to 1.2 billion NZ ($800m) by 2028. \n\nWatch the video to find out what's so special about it and why it costs so much.\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE CONTENT:\nWhy Pedigree Dogs Are So Expensive | So Expensive",
