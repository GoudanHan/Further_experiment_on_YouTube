Harari became an international sensation when he argued in his best-selling book Sapiens that humans conquered the world through our ability to believe in collective myths about gods, money and freedom. In the highly-anticipated sequel Homo Deus, Harari looks to the future, exploring how godlike technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering will define what we become.

                        "description": "(Visit: http://www.uctv.tv) Conversations host Harry Kreisler welcomes Harvard\u2019s Steven Pinker, Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology, for a discussion of his intellectual journey. Pinker discusses the origins and evolution of his thinking on human nature. Topics include: growing up in Montreal in a Jewish family, the impact of the 1960s, his education, and the trajectory of his research interests. He explains his early work in linguistics and how he came to write his recent work, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined. In the conversation, Pinker describes the importance of interdisciplinary research and analyzes creativity. He concludes with a discussion of how science can contribute to the humanities and offers advice to students on how to prepare for the future. Recorded on 02/04/2014. Series: \"Conversations with History\" [4/2014] [Humanities] [Show ID: 27968]",

This is sensible: academics who work outside academia are endlessly criticized for writing \"like a professor\".  Worse, writers who are criticized in this way are often baffled at how to adapt to their new world.  Very often, they try to change aspects of their writing that are not troublesome, and they leave in place aspects of their writing that are making their writing less clear, less logical, and less valuable to their readers. \n\nThis session will be about a few patterns of writing that are likely to aggravate non-academic readers.  We'll focus on patterns that are often difficult for academics to see, but are actually fairly easy to change.",

Harari became an international sensation when he argued in his best-selling book Sapiens that humans conquered the world through our ability to believe in collective myths about gods, money and freedom. In the highly-anticipated sequel Homo Deus, Harari looks to the future, exploring how godlike technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering will define what we become.

                    "description": "An ESMT European School of Management and Technology Open Lecture in cooperation with the American Academy in Berlin's Stephen M. Kellen Lecture Series and Ullstein Buchverlage\n\nAt this ESMT Open Lecture, Harvard professor Niall Ferguson discussed and debated issues raised in his latest book Civilization: The West and the Rest.\n\nAbout the book\nIf in the year 1411 you had been able to circumnavigate the globe, you would have been most impressed by the dazzling civilizations of the Orient. The Forbidden City was under construction in Ming Beijing; in the Near East, the Ottomans were closing in on Constantinople.\n\nBy contrast, England would have struck you as a miserable backwater ravaged by plague, bad sanitation and incessant war. The other quarrelsome kingdoms of Western Europe - Aragon, Castile, France, Portugal and Scotland - would have seemed little better. As for fifteenth-century North America, it was an anarchic wilderness compared with the realms of the Aztecs and Incas. The idea that the West would come to dominate the Rest for most of the next half millennium would have struck you as wildly fanciful. And yet it happened.\n\nWhat was it about the civilization of Western Europe that allowed it to trump the outwardly superior empires of the Orient? The answer, Niall Ferguson argues, was that the West developed six \"killer applications\" that the Rest lacked: competition, science, democracy, medicine, consumerism and the work ethic. The key question today is whether or not the West has lost its monopoly on these six things. If so, Ferguson warns, we may be living through the end of Western ascendancy.\n\nCivilization takes readers on their own extraordinary journey around the world - from the Grand Canal at Nanjing to the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul; from Machu Picchu in the Andes to Shark Island, Namibia; from the proud towers of Prague to the secret churches of Wenzhou. It is the story of sailboats, missiles, land deeds, vaccines, blue jeans and Chinese Bibles. It is the defining narrative of modern world history.\n\nAbout the speaker\nNiall Ferguson is Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University and William Ziegler Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. He is also a Senior Research Fellow at Jesus College, Oxford University, and a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. Born in Glasgow in 1964, Niall Ferguson graduated from Magdalen College with First Class Honors in 1985. After two years as a Hanseatic Scholar in Hamburg and Berlin, he took up a research fellowship at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1989, subsequently returning to Oxford where he was appointed professor of Political and Financial History in 2000. Two years later he left for the US where he took up the Herzog Chair in Financial History at the Stern Business School, New York University, before moving to Harvard in 2004.\n\nNiall Ferguson is a regular contributor to press, television, and radio on both sides of the Atlantic and a prolific commentator on contemporary politics and economics.\n\nFind more information about our open lectures here: ",

Check out the Intelligence Squared website to hear about future live events and podcasts: http://www.intelligencesquared.com \n__________________________\n\nHave historians misunderstood everything? Have they missed the single greatest idea that best explains the past?\n\nNiall Ferguson is the preeminent historian of the ideas that define our time. He has challenged how we think about money, power, civilisation and empires. Now he wants to reimagine history itself.\nIn October 2017, Ferguson came to the Intelligence Squared stage to unveil his new book, 'The Square and The Tower'. Historians have always focused on hierarchies, he argues \u2013 on the elites that wield power. Economists have concentrated on the marketplace \u2013 on the economic forces that shape change. These twin structures are symbolised for Ferguson by Siena\u2019s market square, and its civic tower looming above. But beneath both square and tower runs something more deeply significant: the hidden networks of relationships, ideas and influence.\n\nNetworks are the key to history. The greatest innovators have been \u2018superhubs\u2019 of connections. The most powerful states, empires and companies have been those with the most densely networked structures. And the most transformative ideas \u2013 from the printing presses that launched the Reformation to the Freemasonry that inspired the American Revolution \u2013 have gone viral precisely because of the networks within which they spread.\n\n\u2018When we understand these core insights of network science,\u2019 says Ferguson, \u2018the entire history of mankind looks quite different.\u2019",

Check out the Intelligence Squared website to hear about future live events and podcasts: http://www.intelligencesquared.com \n__________________________\n\nFilmed at the Emmanuel Centre on 5th February 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years since we saw suddenly unemployed Lehman Brothers bankers carrying their possessions out of their offices in boxes; since whole neighbourhoods in suburban America turned into empty ghost towns; since the British and American governments pumped trillions into the banking system, saving some institutions and abandoning others. The crash of 2008 and 2009 shook the very foundations of modern capitalism.\n\nSo where are we today? Although we may have been spared a second Great Depression, post-crisis productivity has flatlined and the last decade has seen Britain\u2019s worst pay squeeze since the nineteenth century. And according to some, the seeds of today\u2019s political upheavals, from Brexit to Trump to the Corbyn surge, were sown during the 2008 crash, which irreparably damaged public trust in the establishment and its institutions.\n\nTo look back at this critical moment for the global economy and examine its repercussions today, Intelligence Squared brought together a panel of the country\u2019s top economic experts: Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England during the crash and its aftermath; acclaimed UCL Economics Professor Mariana Mazzucato, who recently advised Jeremy Corbyn on industrial strategy; and Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on improving the living standards of those on low incomes. Chairing the discussion will be the BBC\u2019s economics editor Kamal Ahmed.\n\nHas enough been done to regulate the banks and protect our economy from future shocks? Is it only a matter of time before we face a new, even worse crash? And did we let the crisis go to waste by failing to rethink the system and rebalance the economy away from financial services?",

Religion is getting a bad press these days. Much of the conflict in the world, from the Middle East to Nigeria and Myanmar, is often blamed on religion.\n\nBut how are things from a different perspective? Defenders of religion claim Adolf Hitler was an atheist. Communism under Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot or Mao Zedong banned religion, but also massacred millions. And science brought incredible and amazing advances, but also pollution and the atomic bomb.\n\nA critic of religious dogmatism, Professor Richard Dawkins revolutionised genetics in 1976 with the publication of The Selfish Gene, which explained how evolution takes place at the genetic level. He has since written 12 more bestsellers, including The God Delusion which sold millions of copies, was translated into more than 30 languages, and catapulted him to the position of the world's foremost atheist.\n\nMehdi Hasan interviews evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins at the Oxford Union and asks: Is religion a force for good or evil? Can it co-exist with science? Is science the new religion? And why if god does not exist, is religion so persistent?",

A calm and beautiful selection of recordings I made for you during the past years. \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find more calm piano music also on my YT channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find my music is also on:\nSpotify:   \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailySpotify\n\nApple Music:    \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailyAppleMusic\n\nrelaxdaily Instagram:      \nhttps://www.instagram.com/relaxdaily/\n\nweb: https://relaxdaily.net\n\nI hope you enjoy the music and have a calm and wonderful day in your style, at your pace.\nMichael (relaxdaily)*\n\nFor new music videos (and 24/7 music streams) see: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily (tick the notification bell when subbing if you like to receive notifications on new music)\n\nThis relaxdaily project (= me creating calm music) can be nourished via Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/relaxdaily\n\n*If you\u2019re new to my music project: I\u2019m Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. \n\nI believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

For now, it appears it will still be a rain even for west Florida this weekend.\n\nFred is expected to move west-northwest between Cuba and the Bahamas through Friday. That also means it will be moving into warmer waters. moving into the Florida Straits and warmer water.\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, Tropical Storm Fred will likely be near South Florida.

                "description": "Tropical Depression Fred has moved back over water after passing over Hispaniola. Fred is expected to remain a Depression through today and possibly becoming a storm once farther from the coast of northern Cuba on Friday.\n\nWhen it emerges in the extreme southeastern Gulf of Mexico late Friday or Saturday, warm sea surface temperatures and waning wind shear could allow the storm to intensify some as it moves NW along the west Florida coast.\n\nWe'll keep watching it as it nudges west/northwest, guided by a high pressure area to its north, but at this time long range models show it curving north around the west coast of Florida in the extreme eastern Gulf. This motion will be due to a break in a ridge of high pressure that will guide it to the north.\n\nWith the current thinking, Fred would make a landfall somewhere near Apalachicola early Monday as a strengthening tropical storm or perhaps a low-end hurricane. \n\nIf it follows this path like we're expecting, there would be minimal to no impacts for southern Louisiana and coastal Mississippi.\n\nWith systems this far out, there is always some uncertainty, but the forecast path has stayed fairly consistent with models and with the general steering pattern for this weekend.\n\nAgain, there are no imminent threats to our part of the Gulf Coast. Of course we'll watch closely as activity picks up this month, and we will keep you updated.",
