                    "description": "Completely disillusioned with a society that rejected him, Gregory P. Smith walked into a rainforest near Byron Bay and became a hermit for 10 years. He exited the forest, on the brink of death and still haunted by personal demons, to eventually gain a Ph.D., become a university lecturer in the Faculty of Business, Law, and Arts and become an ambassador for Australia\u2019s \u2018forgotten children\u2019. This incredible story is a personal testament to \u2018never giving up\u2019. Dr. Gregory P. Smith is a survivor, an academic, and a social researcher. Homeless for much of his adult life living as a recluse in a forest near Byron Bay, he now has a Ph.D. in Sociology and teaches at Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. In 2018 he published his memoir \u2018Out of the Forest\u2019 with Penguin Random House and has been the subject of two Australian documentaries. His profoundly touching and uplifting memoir is at once a unique insight into how far off track a life can go and a powerful reminder that we can all find our way back. Gregory is heavily involved in advocating for the vulnerable and disadvantaged and continues to be the patron of a number of charity organisations while also consulting with several specialist services and agencies. Currently, Dr. Smith is engaged as a consultant and program evaluator in the Premiers Priority Project to reduce rough sleeping in NSW, Australia by 50% in 2025 and zero by 2030. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss.

Hop aboard for an unforgettable journey along the South America\u2019s Transoce\u00e2nica highway!\n\nThe first leg of the journey starts on the Atlantic shore, exploring the Costa Verde, one of the most beautiful coastlines in the country. But it\u2019s not long until the bus crosses into Mato Grasso, the agricultural heart of Brazil, where soy fields and sugar cane plantations dominate the landscape. \n\nThe region is also the home of the rodeo, a regular event in the villages along the Transoce\u00e2nica route. We even find female rodeo riders here in spite of all the cultural prejudices.\n\nParts 2-5:\nPart 2: ",

                "description": "Every third week, a British Royal Mail ship begins its journey from Cape Town to Saint Helena, the remote island in the Atlantic where Napoleon was once in exile.\n\nIt\u2019s like the end of the world in the middle of the Atlantic. Five days, with a northwesterly course, and only then do the sheer black cliffs appear in front of RMS St. Helena. The island\u2019s 4500 residents are often waiting impatiently for the ship\u2019s arrival and panic if the schedule changes. Director Thomas Denzel and his team went on the journey to Saint Helena and met the people living on the island. Many of the residents are descendants of people who were sent into exile there by the British crown - the most famous among them, the French Emperor Napoleon. This is a report about life at the end of the world, loneliness, unique vegetation, and a very special journey.\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.
