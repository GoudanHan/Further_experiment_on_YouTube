Ruling the country for over three hundred years, ruthlessly crushing all competition, The Plantagenet story is more shocking, more brutal and more astonishing than anything you\u2019ll find in Game of Thrones.\n\nPresented by acclaimed historian Dan Jones, the Plantagenets combines his scintillating story-telling with drama reconstruction and brings to life a dramatic and bloody time in England\u2019s history.\n\nThis is history like you\u2019ve never seen it before. Dan delivers his extraordinary take on one of the most visceral and violent chapters in British History. The series begins with Henry II, a control freak betrayed by his own wife and children after the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket. Episode two reveals the collapse of friendship between Henry III and Simon de Montfort, spiraling into bloody civil war. Edward II\u2019s obsession with revenge tears England apart in episode 3. Finally, episode four tells the story of the boy king tyrant, Richard II, one of the most vicious and inventive despots in history.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...
