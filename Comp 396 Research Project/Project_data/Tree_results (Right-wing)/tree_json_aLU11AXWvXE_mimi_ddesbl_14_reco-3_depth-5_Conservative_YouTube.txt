The emotive vocals of the five members of NU\u2019EST combined with a minimal track draw the listener even deeper into the narrative of the lyrics that draw an intricate map of changing emotions.\n\nCredits:\nPRODUCTION\uff5cRIGEND FILM\n\nDIRECTOR\uff5cRIMA YOON, DONGJU JANG\nPD\uff5cHANUL NA\nAD\uff5cSANGWOO PARK, YONGOH LEE, HYERIN CHOI, JOOAE KIM, HANBIT JANG, YUJI SHIN\n \nCG\uff5cRIGEND FILM\n2D\uff5cCOMMA\n3D\uff5cNEVV\n \nDOP\uff5cINMO YUN (ATOD)\nJAEHWAN RYU, KWANGMO KIM, HYUNJI KIM, HYUNAH SEO\n \nDIT\uff5cJIHYEOK LIM\n \nGRIP\uff5cKIHEON CHOI\nSUNGEUN KIM, SANGJUN LEE, SANGHYEOP KIM\n \nJIMMY JIB\uff5cDONGJIN LEE\nKITAE KIM, JIYONG LEE\n \nJIMMY JIB\uff5cYOUNGJUNG KIM\nHYUN IN KIM, SUNG HOON KIM\n \nJIMMY JIB\uff5cSEUNGHYEON JI\nYOUNGSOO KIM, JUNHEE KIM\n \nGAFFER\uff5cJUNHEE PARK (TEAM JJUN), \nGANGMIN JEONG\n \nGAFFER\uff5cSUK HO SON\nDAUN JUNG, WONKYU CHOI, HYUK YOO, JOOSUNG PARK, HWANGJU LEE, JAEYOUNG LEE\n \nGAFFER\uff5cKWANGMIN KIM\nHEON UK SON, GEON IK SON\n \nSHOW LIGHTING\uff5cSUNGGEUN MA\n \nART\uff5cGWIOCK SHIN (A:WE)\n\nSFX l DRAGON\n\nNU\u2019EST The 2nd Album \u2018Romanticize\u2019",
