Karen opens the door for us into a wonderful place, surrounded by nature and enchantment. \nEven though it may seem like a dream, it is truly there, awaiting for us. And just as if we were there with her, we can almost enjoy in first person, the quietness, tranquility and the introspection that she suggests. \u201cLet\u2019s not lose the opportunity of finding moments like this; let\u2019s enjoy and take care of these wonders\u201d she commented.\n\nFollow Karen:",

Here you will find songs with soothing warm pianos and delightful violin melodies. Some of the tracks contain sounds of nature such as rain, waterfalls, and the seashore waves that decrease stress and anxiety. It is proven that calming background music with sustained sounds improves focus and boosts motivation. During long studies or work sessions, our radio will aid your endurance. Neoclassical tracks are famous for minimizing distractions while white noise present in these tunes optimizes concentration, reduces the learning curve and working time, and improves creativity and clarity. \n\nFor best results keep our music in the background to accord both sides of the brain, prepare to seize this day, and as always, enjoy the music!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Image author and inspirator \n Micha\u0142 Karcz\n https://www.behance.net/gallery/64984...\n https://www.deviantart.com/karezoid\n https://500px.com/p/karezoid?view=photos\n https://www.michalkarcz.com/copy-of-home\n\n\nWe have created a new channel and we really need your help.\n \ud83d\ude4f Please like, comment or subscribe.\nGenre: Ambient,  Drone, Modern Classical, Contemporary classical music\nStyle: Downtempo, Spacey Ambient\nMood: Inspiring, Peaceful, Night, Smooth, Calming, Soothing, Space, Nature\nDuration: 24/7\nFeature: Without Lyrics, No vocals\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 Similar videos\nEnergy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nFuture Garage \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nMusic Genres \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAll Music VIdeos \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nWork Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillout Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nStudy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nHacker Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAmbient Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillstep Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n\n #AmbientMusicLive #DroneMusicBackground #ContemporaryClassicalMusic",
