All of that is really important. \n\n\u201cThis gentleman had been out in the community during his infectious period for 10 days.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there is a real risk this already could have spread, which is why from 4pm today, we need to go into lockdown, initially for three days, and I hope that's all that's needed, to work out what the risk is.\u201d",
