It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

At 19, she claimed to have invented a miniaturised machine that with a single drop of blood could map a person\u2019s health quickly, reliably and cheaply. She boasted that her technology meant serious diseases like cancer would be prevented before they happened. And it was not only a \u201cwow\u201d moment for patients. High-profile investors rushed to pour a fortune into Holmes\u2019 company, Theranos, and she became Silicon Valley\u2019s first self-made female billionaire. But as Tara Brown reports, her invention was an invention \u2013 it simply didn\u2019t work. Elizabeth Holmes is no visionary. She\u2019s a cruel fraudster who has put people\u2019s lives at risk, and because of that, now faces 20 years in jail.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",
