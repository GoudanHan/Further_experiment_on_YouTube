He calls for a compassionate approach toward addiction, whether in ourselves or in others. Dr Mat\u00e9 believes addiction is not a choice, neither is it all about drugs and illicit substances. Instead, he believes that addiction affects most of us \u2013 whether it be to alcohol, nicotine, sugar, work or exercise\u2026the list is endless. According to Dr Mat\u00e9, the source of addiction is not to be found in our genes but in our early childhood.\n \nWe also talk about how our emotional stress translates into physical chronic illnesses and how we now live in a culture that doesn\u2019t meet our human needs. Indeed, the conditions necessary for healthy child development are increasingly under threat in today\u2019s society. Loneliness and lack of meaningful connection are on the rise, as are the rates of autoimmune disease and addiction. We discuss how the way we live our modern lives is impacting us more than we realise.\n \nIt was a real honour to sit down and talk eye-to-eye with Gabor about his truly revolutionary work. This was a deep and powerful conversation and I hope it helps you in your lives.\n\nShow notes available at: ",

And we all know a company is only as good as its team, which is why the hiring process is so critical as you start up your venture. Furthermore, anyone who has made a bad hire along the way (as most of us have) knows that hiring the wrong person can cost you far more than time and money. It ultimately makes the difference between market leaders and market laggards - or worse still - failed ventures entirely. Yet, every startup struggles to find the so called \"A+ players\" to build their business. In this session we define what A+ really means and share some tools on how to go after that talent.\n\niRobot's Senior Vice President of HR, Russ Campanello, and Acquia's Global Manager of Talent Acquisition, Eric Gaffen, will talk about the importance of hiring and team building at their companies.  In addition, watch as audience members participate in mock interviews and share the results of their experience.  \n\nLearn more about the Harvard Innovation Lab at ",
