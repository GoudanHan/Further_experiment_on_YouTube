And what\u2019s the deal with meditation?\n\nTen years ago, a team of filmmakers followed David Lynch on a sixteen-country tour and documented a series of lectures and intimate interviews on Lynch's creative process and his relationship to Transcendental Meditation. The resulting footage has been compiled into a documentary entitled  Meditation, Creativity, Peace.\n\nAbout The David Lynch Foundation:\nSince its launch almost ten years ago, the David Lynch Foundation \u2013 founded by the iconic filmmaker David Lynch \u2013 has already provided scholarships to teach Transcendental Meditation to more than 300,000 at-risk youth in underserved schools, veterans with post-traumatic stress (PTS), women who are survivors of domestic violence, and homeless and incarcerated individuals.  DLF Live\u2019s mission is to create incredible, one-night-only experiences with some of the most lauded creatives of our time, introducing music lovers around the world to the healing properties of meditation, and demonstrating how all populations can benefit from this timeless practice.",

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

Templar knights wore pristine white mantles that sported a bright red cross. Known for military prowess, these highly skilled fighting units reached prominence during the Crusades. A major financial institution, the Knights Templar managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Europe. At dawn on Friday, Oct. 13, 1307 (possibly the origin the Friday the thirteenth superstition), French King Philip IV ordered the arrest and execution of the Knights Templar Grand Master Jacque de Molay and scores of other leading knights.\n\nKevin K. Main is an author and lecturer on the subjects of history, philosophy, and religious symbolism, particularly that of Ancient Greece and Europe during the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment period. He has been a student of the history of the Knights Templar and early Christianity for over 20 years.",

Stern Professor; Professor of Classics, University of Chicago speaks at third lecture in our four-part series: Why Did Civilizations Collapse: Internal Decay or External Forces?  The Long Defeat:  The Fall of the Roman Empire in East and West.\n\nThe Roman Empire remains one of the world's longest lived polities.  Its collapse has therefore endured as a great historical puzzle.  Was it barbarians or internal decay?  Or was Christianity to blame?  The lecture will explore a range of theories and consider in detail why the two famous theories, those of St. Augustine and Edward Gibbon, have found so little favor.\n\nFree and open to public thanks to the generous support of Oriental Institute Members and Archaeological Institute of America.\n\nOur lectures are free and available to the public thanks to the generous support of our members.

Using genome data, Krause explains how at least three ancestral groups, the Hunter-Gathers, the Early Farmers and the Ancient North Eurasians, contributed genetic material to present-day Europeans. Krause also discusses these three ancestral populations discovered from this data and explores their connection to present-day Europeans. This lecture is made possible by the Dr. S.T. Lee Fund for Historical Studies. \n\nMore videos on ",

Once again, Europe is witnessing resurgent nationalism that has led to the rise of extremist groups seeking to undermine the status quo. Russia, too, is once more emboldened by the perceived imperative to defend its ethnic and religious kin abroad. And the U.S., exhausted after decades of involvement overseas, has adopted a foreign policy increasingly reminiscent of pre-Wilsonian isolationism. Professor Clark will examine the historic parallels between Europe then and now, and share his thoughts on why Europe went to war in 1914.\nEurope, Then and Now:\nParallels between 1914 and 2014 Considered\n\nfeaturing\n\nProfessor Christopher Clark\nAuthor of The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914\nProfessor of Modern European History, Cambridge University\n\nmoderated by\n\nMs. Heather Conley\nDirector and Senior Fellow, CSIS Europe Program",

Maeir, Professor, The Martin (Szusz) Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology, Bar-Ilan University and Director, The Tell es-Safi/Gath Archaeological Project, The Institute of Archaeology\n\nThe Philistines are well-known from biblical texts as one of the main adversaries of the ancient Israelites. At the same time, the biblical narrative indicates that other types of interactions also were the norm. Recent excavations in Philistia, and in particular those at Tell es-Safi, biblical Gath of the Philistines, hometown of Goliath, have provided exciting evidence of the very complex interaction between these two cultures, revealing the multi-layered facets of what could be termed a Frenemy relationship between the Philistines and Israelites. In addition, recent finds have very much changed our understandingof who the Philistines were, where they came from, and how their culture formed, transformed, and eventually disappeared. These topics will be addressed in this lecture.\n\nThe David Kipper Ancient Israel Lecture Series was established through a gift from Barbara Kipper and the Kipper Family and includes an annual public lecture as well as a lecture for scholars at the Oriental Institute.\n\nOur lectures are free and available to the public thanks to the generous support of our members.

Albright Institute of Archaeological Research, Jerusalem.\n\nArmageddon and the Roman VIth Ferrata Legion\n\nIn the late 1st and early 2nd Centuries CE, dangerous Jewish (and incipient Christian) rebels were causing problems for the Roman Empire in Palestine. Though the First Revolt resulted in the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE and in the establishment of a permanent base of the Xth Legion there, these groups continued to harass their overlords. Historical sources indicate that the Roman VIth Ferrata Legion was deployed to Palestine in the early 2nd Century CE to provide support for the Xth, a sure sign that the rebels were acting up again. The VIth Legion established their base somewhere near Megiddo, but its exact location has been a long-standing question in the archaeology of the period. Using historical and geographical sources, aerial photography, and remote sensing, the Jezreel Valley Regional Project searched for potential locations of the elusive fortress. In 2013 and 2015, one of these locations was examined by excavation, providing the first glimpse of a 2nd Century Roman military base yet uncovered in the entire eastern Empire. Together with the early Christian Prayer hall discovered by Yotam Tepper of the Israel Antiquities authority in 2005 in the adjacent Jewish village of Caparcotani, the new excavations have new implications for Jewish-Christian-Roman relations and for the composition of the Book of Revelation.\n\nOur lectures are free and available to the public thanks to the generous support of our members.

This conflict between the Egyptian forces of Ramses II and the Hittite army of Muwatalli was celebrated as a personal victory by Ramses, but is often treated by modern scholars as an Egyptian defeat or as a stalemate.  In any case, the battle had profound impact on international politics of the age, with unexpected results.  Join us for a lively debate presented from the two sides of the ancient conflict, provided by noted Oriental Institute scholars Robert Ritner, The Rowe Professor of Egyptology, for the Egyptian side, and Theo van den Hout, Arthur and Joann Rasmussen professor of Hittite and Anatolian Languages, for the Hittites.\n\nThank you for your interest in the Oriental Institute Lecture Series. This series allows members, patrons, and friends to continue learning from UChicago faculty and visiting scholars as they present new breakthroughs, unique perspectives, and innovative research applications related to the ancient Middle East. \n\nThe average cost to the Oriental Institute for each lecture is $3,000.

It has happened before.\n\nIn the 12th century BCE the great Bronze Age civilizations of the Mediterranean\u2014all of them\u2014suddenly fell apart.  Their empires evaporated, their cities emptied out, their technologies disappeared, and famine ruled.  Mycenae, Minos, Assyria, Hittites, Canaan, Cyprus\u2014all gone.  Even Egypt fell into a steep decline.  The Bronze Age was over.\n\nThe event should live in history as one of the great cautionary tales, but it hasn\u2019t because its causes were considered a mystery.  How can we know what to be cautious of?  Eric Cline has taken on on the mystery.  An archaeologist-historian at George Washington University, he is the author of \"1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed.\"  The failure, he suggests, was systemic.  The highly complex, richly interconnected system of the world tipped all at once into chaos.\n\n\"1177 B.C.: When Civilization Collapsed\" was given on January 11, 02016 as part of Long Now's Seminar series. The series was started in 02003 to build a compelling body of ideas about long-term thinking from some of the world's leading thinkers. The Seminars take place in San Francisco and are curated and hosted by Stewart Brand. To follow the talks, you can:\n\nSubscribe to our podcasts: ",
