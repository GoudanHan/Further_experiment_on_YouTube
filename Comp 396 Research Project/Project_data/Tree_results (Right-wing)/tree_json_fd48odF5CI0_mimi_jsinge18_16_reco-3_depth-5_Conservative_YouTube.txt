Bret is the author of \"American Psycho,\" \"Less Than Zero,\" and his latest hit, \"White\", and he has been described as the dark laureate of Generation X. Bret shares the inside story of how American Psycho was almost cancelled and a precursor to the cancel culture that we see today. Bret also reveals how the media\u2019s coverage of Trump was a political awakening for him and why he considers himself anti-anti-Trump. He shares how he thinks news institutions like the New York Times and CNN have lost their way. He also reveals the moment that he realized that the media were getting the Trump narrative wrong.\n\nWatch Dave Rubin\u2019s full interview with Bret Easton Ellis here:",
