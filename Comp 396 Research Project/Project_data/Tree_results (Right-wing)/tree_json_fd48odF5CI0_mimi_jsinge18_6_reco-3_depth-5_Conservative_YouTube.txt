You can also cast this video to your TV and enjoy the lake within your home. Give yourself these next 25 minutes to relax. Keep an eye out for a little visitor on the dock near the end!\n\nI was really hoping you could see the tiny little fish that were right below the surface of the water, but this camera wasn't good enough to catch them. You might be able to see specs of them when the light hits the water closest to you, but don't strain yourself.\n\nBest viewed in landscape at 1080s or higher.\n\nMORE CALMING VIDEOS\nOcean Waves at Huntington Beach: ",

    "description": "Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Bret Easton Ellis (best-selling author, screenwriter, and podcast host) about the decline of the mainstream media, cancel culture and why he is anti-anti-Trump. Bret is the author of \"American Psycho,\" \"Less Than Zero,\" and his latest hit, \"White\", and he has been described as the dark laureate of Generation X. Bret shares the inside story of how American Psycho was almost cancelled and a precursor to the cancel culture that we see today. Bret also reveals how the media\u2019s coverage of Trump was a political awakening for him and why he considers himself anti-anti-Trump. He shares how he thinks news institutions like the New York Times and CNN have lost their way. He also reveals the moment that he realized that the media were getting the Trump narrative wrong.\n\nWatch Dave Rubin\u2019s full interview with Bret Easton Ellis here:",
