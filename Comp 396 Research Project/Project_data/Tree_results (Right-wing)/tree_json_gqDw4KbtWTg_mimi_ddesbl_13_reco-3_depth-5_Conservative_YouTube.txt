The drive along the longest bus route in the world continues through South America.\n\nPassing through Rond\u00f4nia, passengers expect an unforgettable journey through the Amazon basin. But there isn\u2019t much left to see of the jungle \u2013 deforestation means the rainforest is shrinking, and with it the indigenous people who call it home. Before the highway passed through their land, the Suri tribe lived here. But outsiders carrying smallpox wiped out nearly the whole population. Those that are left live on a reserve and are fighting to protect the rainforest. \n\nThe bus hits problems as it continues through Rond\u00f4nia. In Vista Alegre do Abun\u00e3, the villagers have blocked the road with a burning barricade. Will the bus be able to get round it?\n\nParts 1-5:\nPart 1: ",

But the passengers have a large part of the journey behind them now and it won\u2019t be long until they reach Peru. They have crossed Brazil and driven through the Peruvian Amazon basin to the Andes. Here, the endless greenery of the basin gives way to increasingly steep rock faces.\n\nThe Incas worshipped these mighty mountains as deities and called them Apus - Gods. The road takes us close to one of them: Apu Ausangate, which is 6,384 meters high. The temperature here is much lower than in the Amazon basin.\n\nThe bus soon reaches Cuzco. For centuries the town was the center of the Inca Empire, until the Spaniards came and burnt it to the ground and built their own palaces on its walls. Today, the city is mainly one thing: a tourist magnet, and the starting point for tours to the legendary ruins of Machu Picchu. The complex is crumbling under the tread of millions of visitors from all over the world, and now the authorities are facing a dilemma: on the one hand, the tourists bring money; on the other the archaeologists want to preserve Machu Picchu for generations to come.\n\nParts 1-5:\nPart 1: ",

We can travel the 1000 year old Inca trail, travel through the Sacred Valley and take a walk in the amazing ruins of Machu Picchu. We can meet kechua and uro indians, we can buy their traditional clothing and listen to their songs and music. From an airplaine, we can try to solve the secret of the Nazca lines, we can take a train to the Altiplano, we can travel through the paradise of the Paracas Paninsula on boat, we can take a look at the monuments of Lima and Cuzco, and follow Thor Heyerdahl\u2019s path, when we sit into a boat on the Titicaca lake.\n\n--------------\nWatch more travel videos \u25ba ",

            "description": "In the final installment of Transoce\u00e2nica, the bus goes from the Andes to the Peruvian coastal desert and then on to the capital Lima. \n\nIn Peru, roughly three times as many people, per capita, are killed on the roads as in Germany or France. Dangerous places in the Andes are often given names such as \"Death Bend\" or \"Jinxed Bend\u201d, marking the spot where people have died. On the high plateau of the Andes, we find vicu\u00f1as, a type of lama, which produce the most expensive wool in the world. However, a parasite has recently decimated vicu\u00f1a stocks, attacking the animals\u2019 skin, leaving them unable to cope with the cold and rain. The western slopes of the Andes are dusty and dry. These mark the start of the Peruvian coastal desert, where the Nazca culture developed over 2,000 years ago. All that remains now are the famous Nazca Lines, enormous geoglyphs etched into the hard floor of the desert. The road then turns north along the Pacific coast, where there are numerous fishing villages. One of them is Pisco, where the local fishing trade has been badly hit by the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. And then finally, after 144 hours and 6,300 kilometers on the bus, we arrive in Lima - just two days late.\n\nWatch the other parts of the journey:\nPart 1: ",

        "description": "Humanity faces major challenges. Could roots hold the answers? It\u2019s possible: Research shows that roots have the potential to provide food for the world's population, stop climate change and help extract resources in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nPlants must withstand periods of drought and heat, as well as flooding, and they use their roots to do this. Roots also help them actively search for nutrients in the soil, while warding off dangers such as pathogens and toxins. Now, scientists at the research institute Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich are investigating root growth using high-tech methods. The goal is to breed stress-resistant seeds for plants with robust roots. They are not alone: In Sweden, Professor Linda Maria M\u00e5rtensson is conducting research on a perennial wheat variety that will ensure higher yields while protecting the soil.\n\nAlong the world's coasts, too, roots are a lifesaver. Coastal ecologist Professor Tjeerd Bouma has discovered that if special grasses are planted in front of dikes, they create a salt marsh that acts as a natural breakwater.\n\nMeanwhile, geochemist Dr. Oliver Wiche of the Technical University of Freiberg is researching something known as \"phytomining.\" He wants to know which plants are best suited for mining metals from the soil. Could this root research give rise to a new, environmentally friendly branch of industry?\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This is exactly what Australian pro-cyclist Lachlan Morton did this summer. He dubbed it the 'Alt Tour de France,' riding 200 miles a day and beating everyone to the punch by five days. Lachlan did it all for World Bicycle Relief, a nonprofit that finds bicycles for people in need.  \n\nOriginally aired on August 6, 2021.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe to the Amanpour and Company. channel here: ",

Here you will find songs with soothing warm pianos and delightful violin melodies. Some of the tracks contain sounds of nature such as rain, waterfalls, and the seashore waves that decrease stress and anxiety. It is proven that calming background music with sustained sounds improves focus and boosts motivation. During long studies or work sessions, our radio will aid your endurance. Neoclassical tracks are famous for minimizing distractions while white noise present in these tunes optimizes concentration, reduces the learning curve and working time, and improves creativity and clarity. \n\nFor best results keep our music in the background to accord both sides of the brain, prepare to seize this day, and as always, enjoy the music!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Image author and inspirator \n Micha\u0142 Karcz\n https://www.behance.net/gallery/64984...\n https://www.deviantart.com/karezoid\n https://500px.com/p/karezoid?view=photos\n https://www.michalkarcz.com/copy-of-home\n\n\nWe have created a new channel and we really need your help.\n \ud83d\ude4f Please like, comment or subscribe.\nGenre: Ambient,  Drone, Modern Classical, Contemporary classical music\nStyle: Downtempo, Spacey Ambient\nMood: Inspiring, Peaceful, Night, Smooth, Calming, Soothing, Space, Nature\nDuration: 24/7\nFeature: Without Lyrics, No vocals\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 Similar videos\nEnergy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nFuture Garage \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nMusic Genres \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAll Music VIdeos \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nWork Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillout Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nStudy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nHacker Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAmbient Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillstep Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n\n #AmbientMusicLive #DroneMusicBackground #ContemporaryClassicalMusic",

We overlook his words at our own peril!\u201d \u2014Cornel West\n\nConsumer protection, environmentalism, and government reform: Since the publication in 1965 of his bestselling critique of the car industry, Unsafe at Any Speed, Ralph Nader, activist, lawyer, and sometime politician has been agitating for causes near and dear to the progressive American agenda for the past 50 years. In the wake of an election season that has illuminated striking divisions within the American populace and prompted immense public reflection on what we believe to be our fundamental rights and freedoms, Nader reflects on his passions and life\u2019s work as an activist now working in Trump\u2019s America.\n\nNamed by The Atlantic as one of the hundred most influential figures in American history, and by Time and Life magazines as one of the most influential Americans of the 20th century, Nader has helped us drive safer cars, eat healthier food, breathe better air, drink cleaner water, and work in safer environments for more than four decades. Nader\u2019s recent books include Unstoppable, The Good Fight, and the bestseller, Seventeen Traditions. Nader writes a syndicated column, has his own radio show, and gives lectures and interviews year round.\n\nGiselle Fernandez, is a five-time Emmy award winning journalist, producer, filmmaker and Latin media marketing entrepreneur. Born in Mexico and raised in Southern California, Fernandez graduated from Sacramento State University with a bachelor of arts in Journalism and Government. She currently serves on the Banc of California\u2019s Hispanic Advisory board, is a member of the board of trustees on the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, City Year (Los Angeles), Excelencia in Education, and the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, and was an original member of President Barack Obama\u2019s Futuro Fund. She is the recipient of the 2014 Imagen Award for Best Online Interview Series, the Golden Mike Foundation\u2019s 2014 Lifetime Achievement Award for Broadcasting, the Legislative Hispanic Caucus Hispanic Spirit Award and has been inducted to the Latina Women\u2019s Museum in Sacramento honoring outstanding Latinas in California.",

It perfectly fits to the gloomy atmosphere of London in the Victorian Age.\nJeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes was, has been and will be the best casting and I cannot accept any other actor as Sherlock.  Maybe only one possible exception would be the modern new character created by Benedict Cumberbatch.\nI wished to play this tune with Theremin and asked Jun Yamamoto to prepare the orchestration.  Though the tune is very short (about 1 minute), please enjoy the fascination at the opening of a mystery with the music.\n\n\u82f1\u56fd\u30b0\u30e9\u30ca\u30c0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u300e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u306e\u5192\u967a\u300f\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u3067\u3059\u3002 \uff11\uff19\u4e16\u7d00\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u671d\u306e\u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u306e\u4ec4\u6697\u3044\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u306b\u5408\u3046\u540d\u66f2\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u30b8\u30a7\u30ec\u30df\u30fc\u30fb\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6f14\u3058\u308b\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u306f\u307e\u3055\u3057\u304f\u672c\u7269\u3002 \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u306f\u5f7c\u4ee5\u5916\u306b\u306f\u8a8d\u3081\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff01(\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u306e\u30ab\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30d0\u30c3\u30c1\u306f\u5225\u683c\u3068\u3057\u3066)\n\u30c6\u30eb\u30df\u30f3\u3067\u5f3e\u304d\u305f\u304f\u3066\u3001Jun Yamamto\u306b\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u306e\u90e8\u5206\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3082\u3089\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002 \u4e00\u5206\u306b\u6e80\u305f\u306a\u3044\u6f14\u594f\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u7269\u8a9e\u304c\u59cb\u307e\u308b\u524d\u306e\u3042\u306e\u308f\u304f\u308f\u304f\u3092\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u304a\u8074\u304d\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059(^^)",
