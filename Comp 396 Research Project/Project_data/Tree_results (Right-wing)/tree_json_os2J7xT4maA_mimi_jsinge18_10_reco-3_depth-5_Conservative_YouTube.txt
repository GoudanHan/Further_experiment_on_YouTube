John Rawls says we should answer this question by asking what principles you would choose to govern the distribution of income and wealth if you did not know who you were, whether you grew up in privilege or in poverty. Wouldnt you want an equal distribution of wealth, or one that maximally benefits whomever happens to be the least advantaged? After all, that might be you. Rawls argues that even meritocracy\u2014a distributive system that rewards effort\u2014doesnt go far enough in leveling the playing field because those who are naturally gifted will always get ahead. Furthermore, says Rawls, the naturally gifted cant claim much credit because their success often depends on factors as arbitrary as birth order. Sandel makes Rawlss point when he asks the students who were first born in their family to raise their hands.\n\nPART TWO: WHAT DO WE DESERVE?\n\nProfessor Sandel recaps how income, wealth, and opportunities in life should be distributed, according to the three different theories raised so far in class. He summarizes libertarianism, the meritocratic system, and John Rawlss egalitarian theory. Sandel then launches a discussion of the fairness of pay differentials in modern society. He compares the salary of former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor ($200,000) with the salary of televisions Judge Judy ($25 million). Sandel asks, is this fair? According to John Rawls, it is not. Rawls argues that an individuals personal success is often a function of morally arbitrary facts\u2014luck, genes, and family circumstances\u2014for which he or she can claim no credit. Those at the bottom are no less worthy simply because they werent born with the talents a particular society rewards, Rawls argues, and the only just way to deal with societys inequalities is for the naturally advantaged to share their wealth with those less fortunate.",

Soft Rain falling is nice to have on while Studying, Relaxing or Meditating. The Rain creates a white noise effect which is useful for Tinnitus and Blocking Noise.

It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",
