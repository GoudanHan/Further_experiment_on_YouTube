Pay close attention to the message.\n\nWill McAvoy (Jeff Daniels) hits the nail on the head in the opening minutes on HBO's series 'The Newsroom'. He is asked by a college student a simple question during a campus debate. 'What makes America the greatest country in the world?'.\n\nDaniels initially goes the politically correct route. Then goes with a honest, bold, straight forward answer that sums up a lot of the worlds problems that so many are afraid to accept because we all want to believe in our system and that it is our system that works.\n\nWe used to be the worlds best of the best and now we are just pretending. The first step to solving a problem is to admit there is one.\n\nI am glad there is a change coming in January 2017.\nUPDATE 07/04/2020 - I still really enjoy the message of this video.\n\n** Affiliate disclaimer: Some of the links listed go to my websites and some are affiliate links which may generate me a sales commission if you make a purchase.",

                "description": "[From \"Kovacs Corner\" on YouTube.com] - William Claude Dukenfield, known professionally as W.C. Fields, with his bizarre and iconoclastic sense of humor, certainly influenced Ernie Kovacs. It had been written that when Fields delivered the story outline of this 1941 film, \"Never Give a Sucker an Even Break\", the suits at Universal Studios thought the film was so surreal that they recut and reshot parts of it. After which they quietly released the film to movie theaters and Fields from his contract. This sketch, featuring character actress Jody Gilbert, gives a new meaning to the term \"customer service\".\n\n[Updated October 16, 2010] \nI found this in the Wikipedia dictionary...\n\n\"Gosha\" is also the beloved name of \"Chuminji\", a cute and baby Indian god of good health. He is favourite of pink-rosy cheeked plump kids. Hithero popular with small kids, the god is supposed to be childlike. He is offered \"pohe\" (an indian dish consisting of flattened rice) and \"gulaabjaamuns\" (also known as \"waffle balls\", it a dough consisting mainly of milk solids and flour in a sugar syrup flavored with cardamom seeds and rosewater or saffron) in worship. He rides on a duck and keeps a rabbit as an advisor and a cat as bodyguard. He lives in \"Goshdesh\". When happy, he blesses anyone with pink skin and plenty of fats, making them look babylike.\n\nI can only suppose that he was throwing a thinly vailed comment about the waitress' (Jody Gilbert) large stature?",

So angered were MPs at this breach of parliamentary privilege that they slammed to doors of the chamber in the faces of the King's men. When Charles finally entered the House of Commons, the Speaker, William Lenthall, refused to reveal the location of the wanted men, famously saying: \"May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\"\n\nThis incident lead to the English Civil War and no monarch has entered the House of Commons since. Every year this event is commemorated during the State Opening of Parliament when Black Rod tries to enter the Commons, the door is slammed in his face to symbolise the independence of the elected House of Commons from the monarchy.\n\nThis video is a dramatisation from the film 'Cromwell'.",

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nRoyal Caribbean International said Tuesday that it will require all guests over the age of 16 traveling from U.S. ports, except those in Florida, to be fully vaccinated.\n\nTravelers aboard ships leaving from Florida ports are strongly recommended to be fully vaccinated but not required to be. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order preventing businesses from asking customers whether they have been vaccinated for Covid-19 or not, preventing the cruise industry from mandating proof of vaccination.\n\nHowever, the company said Tuesday that passengers leaving from Florida ports from Aug. 1 to Dec. 31 who are not vaccinated will be required to have travel insurance. The policies must cover all unvaccinated guests over the age of 12 with at least $25,000 per person in medical expense coverage and $50,000 per person for quarantine and medical evacuation related to a positive Covid-19 test result. The guests will also be required to pay for Covid-19 testing.\n\nOn Aug. 1, the vaccination requirement takes effect for travelers over age 12.\n\nThe company said any travelers who aren\u2019t yet eligible for vaccines will have to show a negative Covid test result and follow certain health protocols.\n\nSix simulation cruises were approved Tuesday to sail later this summer by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those voyages, which test safety protocols before passengers are allowed on board, will leave from ports in Florida, New Jersey, Texas and Washington in July and August.\n\nRoyal Caribbean\u2019s Freedom of the Seas received a conditional sailing certificate from the CDC, which allows it to start sailing Friday. The ship completed its simulation cruise on June 20 from Port Miami.\n\nThe cruise industry is among the last to return to pre-pandemic operations. The CDC allowed cruises to return this year with strict health protocols and requirements in place to prevent outbreaks on board the ships after there were several outbreaks aboard ships last year.\n\nRoyal Caribbean said its guest surveys signal that 90% of all its guests will be fully vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s new vaccine policy comes days after two unvaccinated guests under the age of 16 tested positive for Covid-19 on the cruise operator\u2019s Adventure of the Seas ship.\n\nWeeks earlier, two guests aboard Royal Caribbean\u2019s Celebrity Millennium cruise tested positive and the company\u2019s Odyssey of the Seas was delayed from sailing after eight members of its crew tested positive.\n\nCruise line stocks have been rising after suffering a huge hit during the pandemic. Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises are up more than 11% this year, putting its market cap at just over $21 billion.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: ",
