Starting at a meal among Roy Orbison, George Harrison and Jeff Lynne, the group came together at Bob Dylan's home studio in Malibu, California, to record an additional track as a B-side for the single release of Harrison's \"This Is Love\". Tom Petty's involvement came by chance as Harrison had left his guitar at Petty's house.[3]  The record label, however, decided that the song that resulted, \"Handle with Care\", was too good to be released as a \"single filler\". In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the two Traveling Wilburys albums had limited availability and were out of print in most areas. Harrison, as primary holder of the rights, did not reissue them before his death in 2001. In June 2007, the two albums were reissued as The Traveling Wilburys Collection, a box set including both albums on CD (with bonus tracks) and a DVD featuring a twenty-four minute band documentary and a collection of music videos. The release surprised many when it debuted at #1 in the UK Album Charts[5]  and the Australian album charts.[6]  On the US Billboard 200 it reached #9. The collection sold 500,000 copies worldwide during the first three weeks and remained in the UK top 5 for seven weeks after its release.The lead guitar on the song \"She's My Baby\" (from Volume III) was played by hard rock / blues rock / blues guitarist Gary Moore.",

My latest creation comes with an ocean view from this still wonderful planet, from the southern coast of Australia (Wilsons Prom), which I was able to witness back in 2019.\n\nMusic title: The Way I Am  |  Artist: relaxdaily\n\n::: \nThis tune is inspired by many, but also by those who sometimes against all odds, sometimes with conditions that make life way more challenging, still go into each day with full awareness that this body, this circumstance, is what there is, and they try to make the best out of each day and every week. These wonderful humans are an inspiration and a wonderful example of how valuable the days we got in our bodies here on this planet are.\n\nThe title is to be seen from your perspective. No matter the condition, no matter the circumstance, you are a part of the whole, you do good, you create value, add your personal note, you inspire oftentimes without knowing, simply by being you. That\u2019s why we love you. Smile and say, \u201cYes, this is The Way I Am\u201d.\n:::\n\nThank you for your inspiration, for being a wonderful human being!\n\ud83d\udc9b Michael (relaxdaily*)\n\n\nYes, some relaxdaily music is also on Apple, Amazon, YouTube Music, Spotify, and Patreon.\n\n\nA big THANK YOU to my patrons on Patreon:",

A calm and beautiful selection of recordings I made for you during the past years. \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find more calm piano music also on my YT channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find my music is also on:\nSpotify:   \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailySpotify\n\nApple Music:    \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailyAppleMusic\n\nrelaxdaily Instagram:      \nhttps://www.instagram.com/relaxdaily/\n\nweb: https://relaxdaily.net\n\nI hope you enjoy the music and have a calm and wonderful day in your style, at your pace.\nMichael (relaxdaily)*\n\nFor new music videos (and 24/7 music streams) see: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily (tick the notification bell when subbing if you like to receive notifications on new music)\n\nThis relaxdaily project (= me creating calm music) can be nourished via Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/relaxdaily\n\n*If you\u2019re new to my music project: I\u2019m Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. \n\nI believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

A calm and beautiful selection of recordings I made for you during the past years. \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find more calm piano music also on my YT channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily \n\n\ud83c\udfa7 find my music is also on:\nSpotify:   \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailySpotify\n\nApple Music:    \nhttps://bit.ly/relaxdailyAppleMusic\n\nrelaxdaily Instagram:      \nhttps://www.instagram.com/relaxdaily/\n\nweb: https://relaxdaily.net\n\nI hope you enjoy the music and have a calm and wonderful day in your style, at your pace.\nMichael (relaxdaily)*\n\nFor new music videos (and 24/7 music streams) see: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily (tick the notification bell when subbing if you like to receive notifications on new music)\n\nThis relaxdaily project (= me creating calm music) can be nourished via Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/relaxdaily\n\n*If you\u2019re new to my music project: I\u2019m Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. \n\nI believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day, or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light, and precious soundtrack for you.\n\nMany use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.\n\nMy music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.\n\nThank you for following, listening, liking and loving, sharing, and commenting!\nMichael\n\n\u00a92011-2021 relaxdaily.net - patreon.com/relaxdaily",

Does the coverage of political news rarely seem \u201cfair and balanced\u201d? Serious discussions on US politics is vital to having a healthy democracy. No matter what political party you belong to, we need to be able to hear a variety of political perspectives.
