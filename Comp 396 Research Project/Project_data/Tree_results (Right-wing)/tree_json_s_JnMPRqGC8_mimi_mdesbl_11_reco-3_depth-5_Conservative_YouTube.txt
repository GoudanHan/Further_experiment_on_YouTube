Well known for his sharp wit as well as his originalist approach to the Constitution, Justice Scalia consistently asks more questions during oral arguments and makes more comments than any other Supreme Court justice. And, according to one study, he also gets the most laughs from those who come to watch these arguments. In September 2010, Justice Scalia spoke with UC Hastings law professor Calvin Massey.

                        "description": "Supreme Court Justice Scalia Addresses the Pepperdine Community\n\n\nAntonin Scalia, associate justice of the United States, spoke to a packed audience of more than 625 people on March 9, 2009 in the Caruso Auditorium at the School of Law. The acclaimed Supreme Court justice spoke with School of Law dean Ken Starr on a variety of legal topics, including how the Court has changed over the years.\n\nWhen asked why there have been many dissenting opinions in recent years, Scalia said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind there being dissents. On an issue of law, let\u2019s say an issue of statutory construction, where we all agree on what the principles are, you can disagree on how much weight to give each aspect of one canon of interpretation versus another canon. But what is different about what has been happening for the last 30 years or so is that we disagree on the fundamentals. We disagree on what we think we\u2019re doing when we interpret the Constitution. There are only two of us for sure on the Court who are originalists, who think the object of the exercise is to figure out what it was the American people agreed to as an exception from the principle of rights when they adopted the First Amendment or Fifth Amendment.\u201d\n\nScalia continued the discussion about originalists versus \u201cconsequentialists,\u201d\nwho believe that the Constitution is a living, ever-changing document. He answered questions from the audience, discussed his own written opinions, and spoke on who he considers the greatest justices (Marshall, Brandeis, and Jackson).\n\nScalia was born in Trenton, New Jersey, March 11, 1936. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree from Georgetown University and the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and his LLB from Harvard Law School. President Reagan nominated him as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, and he took his seat September 26, 1986.",

Hopwood took her case to court, arguing the schools affirmative action program violated her rights. Students discuss the pros and cons of affirmative action. Should we try to correct for inequality in educational backgrounds by taking race into consideration? Should we compensate for historical injustices such as slavery and segregation? Is the argument in favor of promoting diversity a valid one? How does it size up against the argument that a students efforts and achievements should carry more weight than factors that are out of his or her control and therefore arbitrary? When a universitys stated mission is to increase diversity, is it a violation of rights to deny a white person admission?\n\nPART TWO: WHATS THE PURPOSE?\n\nSandel introduces Aristotle and his theory of justice. Aristotle disagrees with Rawls and Kant. He believes that justice is about giving people their due, what they deserve. When considering matters of distribution, Aristotle argues one must consider the goal, the end, the purpose of what is being distributed. The best flutes, for example, should go to the best flute players. And the highest political offices should go to those with the best judgment and the greatest civic virtue. For Aristotle, justice is a matter of fitting a persons virtues with an appropriate role.",

                    "description": "Professor Jim Al-Khalili traces the story of arguably the most important, accurate and yet perplexing scientific theory ever: quantum physics.\n\nThe story of quantum physics starts at the beginning of the 20th century with scientists trying to better understand how light bulbs work. This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.\n\nAlbert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s. Professor Al-Khalili repeats this critical experiment, posing the question does reality really exist, or do we conjure it into existence by the act of observation?\n\nElsewhere, we explore how the most famous law of quantum physics \u2013 The Uncertainty Principle \u2013 is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis. Could quantum mechanics explain the greatest mystery in biology - evolution?\n\nContent Provided By TVF International.

This music suits almost any type of work: whether you are a social media marketing specialist creating content for an Instagram page, or a big company boss solving daily issues. Cozy late-night work visuals will be a nice background in the \u201cwork with me\u201d style. Now it\u2019s a perfect time to propel your career to new heights. Have a nice productive work session! \n\nWork from home tips to maximize your productivity:\n\n1. Get ready for your workday. Our brains are programmed in a way that takes cues from our social and personal outlook while making a decision. When you dress up for your work, you give the brain a reason for doing it. It\u2019s like a natural alarm that can keep you alert throughout the day.\n2. Choose a proper home office. As much as home working is convenient for many as they can coop up in their bed or couch, it becomes challenging to resist the temptation of sleep with our not-so-healthy sleep routine. A dedicated workspace will enable you to keep yourself oriented to your work by providing an office-esque environment.\n3. Maintain consistent working hours. When your mind is completely onto work, it is quite possible for you to be unaware of the amount of time that has passed. If you plan on working for 8 hours straight on a workday, from 10 am to 6 pm, make sure you stick to your schedule.\n4. Eat & sleep right. One of the perks of working from home is free access to the kitchen. As soon as it is time for breaks, you gravitate towards it to grab some snacks. This practice does not benefit you, in any way. Being on a healthy diet is very essential when you are a working person. \n5. Set a morning & evening routine. Work on your sleep schedule, meditate and exercise regularly. \n6. Prepare a to-do list/planner. Creating a to-do list would allow you to keep track of your progress efficiently. \n7. Music can boost your productivity!

Dr. Leary became the\nLSD guru, challenging convention, questioning authority, and spawned a global counter culture\nmovement, landing in prison after Nixon called him, \u201cthe most dangerous man in America.\u201d Dr.\nAlpert journeyed to India becoming Ram Dass, a spiritual teacher for an entire generation who still\ncontinues his teaching of service through compassion.\nWith footage spanning 80 years the film invites us to ponder questions about life, drugs, consciousness\nand the biggest mystery in the human landscape: death.",

Named for the ancient trade route linking Asia, Africa and Europe, The Silk Road Ensemble, an international collective created by acclaimed cellist Yo-Yo Ma, exemplifies music\u2019s ability to blur geographical boundaries, blend disparate cultures and inspire hope for both artists and audiences.  \"The Music of Strangers: Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble\", the latest film from the creators of the Oscar-winning documentary \"20 Feet from Stardom\" and the critically-hailed \"Best of Enemies\", follows an ever-changing lineup of performers drawn from the ensemble\u2019s more than 50 instrumentalists, vocalists, composers, arrangers, visual artists and storytellers as they gather in locations across the world, exploring the ways art can both preserve traditions and shape cultural evolution.  Blending performance footage, personal interviews and archival film, director Morgan Neville and producer Caitrin Rogers focus on the journeys of a small group of Silk Road Ensemble mainstays from across the globe to create an intensely personal chronicle of passion, talent and sacrifice.",

                    "description": "JEREMIAH TOWER: THE LAST MAGNIFICENT explores the remarkable life of Jeremiah Tower, one of the most controversial and influential figures in the history of American gastronomy. Tower began his career at the renowned Chez Panisse in Berkeley in 1972, becoming a pioneering figure in the emerging California cuisine movement.  After leaving Chez Panisse, due in part to a famously contentious relationship with founder Alice Waters, Tower went on to launch his own legendary Stars Restaurant in San Francisco.  Stars was an overnight sensation and soon became one of America\u2019s top-grossing U.S. restaurants.  After several years, Tower mysteriously walked away from Stars and then disappeared from the scene for nearly two decades, only to resurface in the most unlikely of places: New York City\u2019s fabled but troubled Tavern on the Green.  There, he launched a journey of self-discovery familiar to anyone who has ever imagined themselves to be an artist.  Featuring interviews by Mario Batali, Anthony Bourdain, Ruth Reichl and Martha Stewart, this delicious documentary tells the story of the rise and fall of America\u2019s first celebrity chef, whose brash personality and culinary genius has made him a living legend.",

Inspired by her experience, she returned to the U.S. to explore what yoga means to the West and how it can transform lives. What she found was something wonderful: a path that can enable anyone to transform suffering in order to experience daily peace and happiness.",

Self-medicated and on the brink of a mental breakdown, a secret group that call themselves \u201cInfinites\u201d come to his rescue, revealing to him that his memories are real \u2013 but they are from multiple past lives.

With critical secrets buried in his past, Evan must work with the Infinites to unlock the answers in his memories in a race against time to save humanity from one of their own (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who seeks to destroy it.",

The result? There's a whole lot of stress about creating things that are, frankly, mediocre. How can we find a little relief and still get results? Focus on the remarkable. Tara McMullin is a writer, podcaster, and entrepreneur. She's the founder & host of What Works, a platform that connects small business owners committed to building stronger businesses. She's also the co-founder of YellowHouse.Media, a podcast production agency. Tara brings a feminist perspective to building businesses and encourages entrepreneurs to question conventional wisdom when it comes to marketing, productivity, sales, and team-building. She draws on her varied background\u2014from her education in religion and philosophy, experience in fitness and endurance training, and interests in science and politics\u2014to offer a multidisciplinary approach to entrepreneurship.

            "description": "Authentic listening is a sorely neglected skill in education. In this lecture, Laura shall talk about why it's so important to listen, and shall offer strategies for becoming a better listener, using insights from volunteer work on the Rape Crisis Helpline.  Dr. Laura Major is a lecturer at Achva Academic College, where she serves as head of the English department. Laura's research fields include crime fiction, Holocaust literature, creative writing, and the intersection of gender with all of the above. Recently, she has delved into pandemic literature and the pedagogy thereof. Laura serves as a rape crisis counselor, the role which inspired her TED talk. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",
