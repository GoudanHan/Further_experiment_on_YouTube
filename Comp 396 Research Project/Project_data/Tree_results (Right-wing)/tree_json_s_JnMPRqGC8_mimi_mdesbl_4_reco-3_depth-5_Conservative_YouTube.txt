He has become a hero to hundreds of public and private sector organizations for his indispensable counsel and strategic insight on safeguarding information systems and combating cyber-fraud.\n\nWith an eye on the latest techniques developed by high-tech criminals to deceive and defraud, Frank leaves audiences with a deep understanding of today\u2019s evolving security landscape, and more importantly, a vision of how to make the world a safer place.",

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

These and other pressing issues are part of a debate about radical agricultural reform of policy currently going on in Brussels.\n\nWhen negotiations on the common agricultural policy from 2020 are held in Brussels, one of the more contentious issues will be how to redistribute 60 billion Euros in EU agricultural subsidies. How will MEPs prioritize their options? Will they reach independent decisions or cave in to the big agricultural conglomerates and special interest groups? Our exclusive report uncovers their close ties with politicians in both Brussels and Berlin and shows how efforts to make farming more environmentally sustainable are being stymied.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?\n\nThis documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI\u2019s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI\u2019s social implications?\n\nA documentary by Tilman Wolff und Ranga Yogeshwar \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Quinn, Professor Emeritus, University of Michigan \u2013 Keynote speaker. In Pursuit of Flourishing: Helping People Learn From Social Excellence.\nDr. Edard Sarath, Professor of Music, University of Michigan. Black Music Matters: Improvisation, Consciousness and the Future \nDr. Judi Neal, CEO, Edgewalkers International\nModerator: \nDr. Dennis Heaton, Professor of Management, Maharishi International University, USA. \n\nThis keynote session focuses on flourishing.  In the first fifteen minutes, \nRobert E. Quinn will make a presentation on helping people learn from social excellence.  Drawing on the last twenty years of research in positive organizational scholarship, he will offer a framework of high performance. Drawing from his recent book with Anjan Thakor, The Ecomomics of Higher Purpose, he will discuss why CEOs and other leaders are limited in their ability to recognize, learn from, or co-create social excellence.  He will discuss the evolution in consciousness necessary to bring about the emergence of flourishing social systems.\n\nEdward Sarath\u2019s presentation takes Black Lives Matter into the realm of the creative arts, with the rich legacy of Black American Music (BAM) as a primary vehicle. A consciousness-based view of BAM illuminates underlying principles that open up powerful connections to an array of contemporary issues, including social justice, ecological justice, educational reform, transcendence of political and ideological divides, arts-based spirituality and peace. Improvisation, at the heart of a BAM aesthetics and increasingly recognized for its application across fields as seemingly disparate as business, engineering, medicine, social activism and sports, exemplifies the creativity principle that will be central to how humanity navigates the complexities and turbulence of the present moment. Meditation and corresponding understanding of human consciousness as intersubjective and transcendent of (even if linked with) the physical is a further principle that underlies the improvisatory creativity realm. Inspired by a long legacy of jazz innovators, such as John Colrane, Alice Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and John McLaughlin, who harnessed the improvisation-meditation relationship in their lives and work, the presentation will describe how the Black Music Matters project seeks to operationalize this principle through performances, workshops, educational reform initiatives and community engagement projects that bring attention to BAM as a rich transformative treasure that has long been in our midst but eluded recognition. \n\nDr. Judi Neal: From Workplace Spirituality to Global Consciousness\nThe workplace spirituality movement began in the early 1990s, primarily in the corporate sector, although there were beginnings of interest in academia by the mid to late nineties. This talk traces the evolution of the field from a focus on private personal practices to more systemic approaches within organizations to a growing interest in consciousness-based leadership at three different levels. Each of these levels has implications for education, coaching, and a collective shift in humanity to an awareness of our Oneness.\n\nDr. Dennis Heaton is Dean of the College of Business and Professor of Management at Maharishi International University, Fairfield, Iowa. He earned an Ed.D. in Educational Leadership from Boston University. He has published extensive research on consciousness-based education and the unified theory of leadership.",

                    "description": "Brief History of that other economic designed crash of 1929\nBBC documentary\n\nOn October 29, 1929, Black Tuesday hit Wall Street as investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors. In the aftermath of Black Tuesday, America and the rest of the industrialized world spiraled downward into the Great Depression (1929-39), the deepest and longest-lasting economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world up to that time.\n\n1929 Stock Market Crash\n\nDuring the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, after a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value. Among the other causes of the eventual market collapse were low wages, the proliferation of debt, a struggling agricultural sector and an excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated.\n\nStock prices began to decline in September and early October 1929, and on October 18 the fall began. Panic set in, and on October 24, Black Thursday, a record 12,894,650 shares were traded. Investment companies and leading bankers attempted to stabilize the market by buying up great blocks of stock, producing a moderate rally on Friday. On Monday, however, the storm broke anew, and the market went into free fall. Black Monday was followed by Black Tuesday (October 29), in which stock prices collapsed completely and 16,410,030 shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors, and stock tickers ran hours behind because the machinery could not handle the tremendous volume of trading.\n\n\n1929 Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression\n\nAfter October 29, 1929, stock prices had nowhere to go but up, so there was considerable recovery during succeeding weeks. Overall, however, prices continued to drop as the United States slumped into the Great Depression, and by 1932 stocks were worth only about 20 percent of their value in the summer of 1929. The stock market crash of 1929 was not the sole cause of the Great Depression, but it did act to accelerate the global economic collapse of which it was also a symptom. By 1933, nearly half of America\u2019s banks had failed, and unemployment was approaching 15 million people, or 30 percent of the workforce.",

Her partner went to the hospital.\n\nWhen Mayor Lightfoot went to the hospital to visit the injured police officer, Mr Murray said the family \"did not want her to be there\" and the police officers present \"turned their back on her\"\n\n\"Are police human beings? Yes. Are they perfect? No. But do they deserve to have their funding cut at a time when crime goes through the roof? Absolutely not.\n\n\"Good on the cops.\"",

It\u2019s possible: Research shows that roots have the potential to provide food for the world's population, stop climate change and help extract resources in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nPlants must withstand periods of drought and heat, as well as flooding, and they use their roots to do this. Roots also help them actively search for nutrients in the soil, while warding off dangers such as pathogens and toxins. Now, scientists at the research institute Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich are investigating root growth using high-tech methods. The goal is to breed stress-resistant seeds for plants with robust roots. They are not alone: In Sweden, Professor Linda Maria M\u00e5rtensson is conducting research on a perennial wheat variety that will ensure higher yields while protecting the soil.\n\nAlong the world's coasts, too, roots are a lifesaver. Coastal ecologist Professor Tjeerd Bouma has discovered that if special grasses are planted in front of dikes, they create a salt marsh that acts as a natural breakwater.\n\nMeanwhile, geochemist Dr. Oliver Wiche of the Technical University of Freiberg is researching something known as \"phytomining.\" He wants to know which plants are best suited for mining metals from the soil. Could this root research give rise to a new, environmentally friendly branch of industry?\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB\n\nJust before his passing on January 10, 2014, Sam Berns was a Junior at Foxboro High School in Foxboro, Massachusetts, where he achieved highest honors and was a percussion section leader in the high school marching band. He also achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. Sam was diagnosed with Progeria, a rare, rapid aging disease, at the age of 2. He is featured in the Emmy award-winning documentary Life According to Sam, which premiered on HBO on October 21, 2013, 2 days before his 17th birthday.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

There are currently about 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. Hundreds die each year while crossing the desert to enter the country. The border is a 362-mile stretch of land fraught with danger. As Mexicans and other immigrants from Latin America seek a new life in the U.S., border patrol is the least of their worries, overshadowed by risk of animal attacks, dehydration, exhaustion or betrayal by the guides they trusted to lead them across. \n\nThis seven-minute documentary highlights the impact this journey has on immigrants, border patrol agents, advocates and ranchers.",

Vincent Otumbo takes us through the power in which your perspective plays in your life. \"In my confusion and struggle to find my true identity, I met a Mentor who guided me on how to find clarity in my purpose, passion, profession, vocation, and mission. This kind of clarity led me into developing a seven-module personal development program \u2013 The Personal Mastery Program and ultimately, co-founding Sav Skills Limited to offer Training, Coaching and Mentorship.\"\nEveryone desires to be a great leader, but not everyone chooses to be a leader. Otumbo believes in leadership at every level of life. This includes family, relationships, organizational growth, and development. In his view, leadership is a choice and has to be an intentional and deliberate journey for those who pursue it. Towards leadership growth, Otumbo develops tailored training programs to meet individual and organizational objectives.

Look, racism does exist but by many indications, including this video, society has gone backwards on the issue of race. Again, I acknowledge that racism exists but the question is SYSTEMIC racism. These people interviewed answered this way prior to 2020. Under today's less than friendly environment to share opinions, likely they'd answer differently now because we have gone backwards on the issue or racism. Yes, a few events are largely to blame, and the media is to be blamed as well....you can see from this video that the media interviewers are now much more provoking these days than they were prior to 2020.  It's interesting to think that ridding the world of racism is not a linear progressive timeline, you can go backwards on ridding the world of race as well and by \"some\" indications that seems to be what is happening. Did you notice that when you really get out of your home and go shopping, to the park, etc. that your perception in real life differs from what you see in the media?",
