What\u2019s more, is that LOONA created a bigger wave of change with their passion to make a world where not even a single girl is oppressed. \n\n[&] album is about why LOONA had no choice but to break the fixed rules and become one with all LOO\u03a0\u0394s around the world, after making bigger waves of change.\nLOONA holds a variety of symbolic objects that symbolize their dignity. Among those, the symbolic color has a significant connection with the message that LOONA wishes to convey through this album.\n\n\u201cAnd all LOO\u03a0\u0394s are one\u201d, all LOONAs in the world paint the world with their own colors and conveys the message that they will shout out \u201cPaint The Town\u201d in one voice after they found their own colors.\n\nFinally conquering the LOONAverse with their own strengths, LOONA then discovers a bigger world that they have never known about.\n\nThe intro \u2018&\u2019 holds a story about you, me, and us together (&) becoming one after breaking the fixed, conventional symbols.\n\nThe title track 'PTT (Paint The Town)' is a hip-hop dance genre with the most intense and explosive energy of LOONA that they have released so far. \n\n\u2018PTT (Paint The Town)' combines all the essential elements from chart-topping Bollywood songs, with a massive Indian drums and tablas combined with aggressive dubstep and 808 bass sounds, a hypnotic Indian flute playing the signature melody of the song and a massive chorus. The minimalist verses and building prechorus parts all lead to haunting chorus parts with a melody line you will never get out of your head.\n\nThis title track aims to establish and redefine themselves after breaking the rules without being trapped in taboos or being wary of others to \"Paint The Town\" in LOONA\u2019s colors.\n \n\u2018WOW\u2019 is a song with a bouncy, up-tempo and infectious beat. LOONA celebrates with the world all the women out there and encourages every girl to be strong and confident through this empowering song.\n\n'Be Honest' is a refreshing song with an upbeat tempo, telling you to be confident about your feelings and be honest just like the name of the song. \n\n\u2018Dance On My Own\u2019 is an emotional but high-paced energetic song that mixes the organic strums of affected acoustic guitar with hip hop drums. This song will both make you feel things as much as it will make you want to dance.\n\n\u2018Different Night\u2019 is a story of the girls who spend different nights at the same time. It\u2019s an emotional ballad song with a signature melody of a dreamy and sentimental pad and pluck sound.\n\nThe last track \u2018U R\u2019 is a Lofi R&B song with a sentimental piano and gentle electric guitar combined with LOONA\u2019s voice. It\u2019s about expressing love to the loved one who approached you like a heart-warming star and shined upon you.\n\nAfter being one, a hero comes into the world by LOONA.",
