Explore the physics behind some of the tallest buildings and megastructures in the world.\n\n--\n\nIn 1956, architect Frank Lloyd Wright proposed a mile-high skyscraper, a building five times as high as the Eiffel Tower.

The earliest known evidence comes from 7,000 BCE in China, where residue in clay pots has revealed that people were making an alcoholic beverage from fermented rice, millet, grapes, and honey. So how did alcohol come to fuel global trade and exploration? Rod Phillips explores the evolution of alcohol.\n\nLesson by Rod Phillips, directed by Anton Bogaty.\n\nAnimator's website: ",

The yin, the dark swirl, is associated with shadows, femininity, and the trough of a wave; the yang, the light swirl, represents brightness, passion and growth. John Bellaimey explains why we all contain the spirit of yin and of yang -- and how we can achieve a balance of both in our lives.\n\nLesson by John Bellaimey, animation by TED-Ed.",

Their study involved real people, truthfully reported data, and commonplace statistical analyses. So how did they do it? The answer lies in a statistical method scientists often use to try to figure out whether their results mean something, or if they\u2019re random noise. James A. Smith explores p-hacking.\n\nLesson by James A. Smith, directed by Anton Bogaty.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: ",

He wanted a solution for blurry vision that fixed the eye itself, without relying on external aids. The surgery he eventually devised was called \u201ckeratomileusis,\u201d and his technique focused on reshaping the cornea\u2014 what we now know as LASIK. So how does laser eye surgery actually work? Dan Reinstein explains.\n\nLesson by Dan Reinstein, directed by Hype CG.\n\nEducator's website: ",
