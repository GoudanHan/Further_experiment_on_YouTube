WITH GRAHAM NORTON at 11/10c.\n \nThe UK's biggest, most outrageous talk show has returned for its 10th season with must-see guests: Oscar winner Robin Williams, actor Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings, Wilfred), iconic comedienne Jennifer Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous) and British boyband JLS. As always, expect Norton's trademark comedy monologues and eccentric stories.\n \nHere, Robin Williams discusses a mortifying omission as he accepted his Oscar in 1998 for Good Will Hunting - sorry, Mom! And Hobbit extraordinaire Elijah Wood recalls a hysterical encounter with Hollywood legend (and proud non-Ring-er) Jack Nicholson backstage at the Golden Globes... complete with dead-on, laugh-out-loud impressions.\n \nDon't miss all new episodes of The Graham Norton Show, every Saturday at 10/9c.

Pay close attention to the message.\n\nWill McAvoy (Jeff Daniels) hits the nail on the head in the opening minutes on HBO's series 'The Newsroom'. He is asked by a college student a simple question during a campus debate. 'What makes America the greatest country in the world?'.\n\nDaniels initially goes the politically correct route. Then goes with a honest, bold, straight forward answer that sums up a lot of the worlds problems that so many are afraid to accept because we all want to believe in our system and that it is our system that works.\n\nWe used to be the worlds best of the best and now we are just pretending. The first step to solving a problem is to admit there is one.\n\nI am glad there is a change coming in January 2017.\nUPDATE 07/04/2020 - I still really enjoy the message of this video.\n\n** Affiliate disclaimer: Some of the links listed go to my websites and some are affiliate links which may generate me a sales commission if you make a purchase.",

    "description": "Trump REFUSED Emergency Request To Pay For Leftist Rioters Damage, Democrats Leadership Backfires. The Governor of Minnesota has requested of Trump around $16 Million dollars in order to fix damage caused by the far left riots in Minneapolis.\n\nBut what would the outcome be? The city has just voted to abolish the police outright. Why should the US tax payer bail out a city with severe leadership problems?\n\nIf Democrats in MN can't run things properly then the people need to vote them out, not expect a handout from Trump or the federal government.",
