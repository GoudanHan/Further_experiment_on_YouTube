I think history is completely different than we've been taught,0.82819438,C,positive
The wooden bird was created for those sailing the Nile to see the direction of the wind and the speed. It never soared over the desert. The ancient Egyptians relied heavily on the wind. I think that in itself is fascinating. Why do have to create these fantastical stories about ancient Egypt. The Egyptians were extremely practical people. Inventions with useful purposes in their day to day life were of much more value than toy birds that could fly. They probably wouldn__ have been concerned with trying to fly. They had a convenient natural highway called the Nile which they felt was sent by the Gods and made them special.,0.84060681,C,positive
The tall vertical tail meant that this bird was used as a wind vane to detect which direction the wind was coming from. They would have known from which direction sand storms were likely to come from and thus used this bird to detect such wind directions.,0.7550782,C,neutrally positive
"I think the wooden bird flies because it was modelled directly from _ a bird, and birds actually do fly.  It__ the bird that has developed the secret power of flight over millennia, not humans. As for the weird carvings, if you look closely you can see they bump up against the hieroglyphs, especially note the standing bird glyph. Egyptians spaced everything according to strict rules, they never carved symbols that bumped into each other. I think those weird carvings are a lot more recent than we are led to believe here. This doesn__ negate the influence of higher evolved visitors at some time, or the Atlanteans (who may have begun an isolated mini-civilisation after a crash landing, and much later had to flee to Egypt, the Gobi Desert region__ot desert then__nd the Andes), but I don__ think this is the evidence for any of that.",0.80091089,C,positive

"For a civilization that had the ability to built the massive pyramids to such precision, using simple tools available at its time, they must have studied very in-depth about various scientific theories.

"Book titled ""The Atlantis Blueprint"" by Rand Flem-Ath and Colin Wilson, explains it all. There was an advanced civilization on the Earth, and this book outlines many proofs stating that before a massive shift of Earth's ""crust""; which caused Great Flooding stories, the current Antarctic Continent was higher up and much  more habitable. It also was ""the hub"" for an advanced human civilization. The real mystery is how they have been able to suppress and ignore such a well written and exquisitely researched study by serious academically credentialed researchers!! I cringe after coming upon these shows on History, Discovery, ""Science"", etc. that continually talk about Atlantis being in the Caribbean, Atlantic or Mediterranean Seas/Oceans. At least they have not banned this book yet, but they sure like to ignore it. Also, they have ""closed off"" the entire Antarctic Continent to visitation or study, except for ""specially approved"" personnel!!",0.72760212,C,neutrally positive

"A good friend of mine from High School died preventing an incident that almost took out a vehicle full of Navy Seals.  Chief Petty Officer Jason Finan was the first casualty of the retaking of Mosul, Iraq on October 20th, 2016.  After spotting an IED he pulled his truck to prevent Seal Team 3 from driving through it.  He was one of those guys that disarms bombs.  Anyway, it wasn't the one he saw that got him.  That one turned out to be a decoy, the one that got him was hidden.  I can't even imagine what these guys go through but I can tell you not being an emotional person must help because the feelings I felt, as a citizen, thousands of miles away when I first heard the news were completely unexpected.  Reading about war, seeing it in the news and movies, none of it gets real until someone you know is killed over there.  I found myself thinking about the sick pathetic piece of shit who built that IED, similar to that fire you get when someone effs with one of your friends or family but quite a bit more.  I'm not an angry person, nor violent, yet I found myself day dreaming of pretty messed up shit happening to that guy....  And yet I am here, in the comfort of my home, thousands of miles away... While those guys are still out there, right now and these things are happening to their friends and family right before their eyes...

Matt showing up late and becoming unreliable because of his vigilante-ing is a major point of conflict between him and his team. This tension, and the loss of this case actually causes them to shut down their law firm, and nearly totally destroys their longterm friendship. 

Their longshot defense strategies are only because Frank is pretty much indefensible. The only reason they took the case in the first place is because irregularities, or rather flat out lies, in the witness reports of Karen Page, when she talked with the court appointed public defender. Leading them to believe some foul play/tampering had taken place to ensure a conviction. They also learned that the DA wanted to extradite Castle to Delaware, where he could be given the death penalty. Come to find out the DA was planning on using this case as a springboard for her own agenda, and she didn't care about actual justice. Them putting Castle on the stand, they knew was a terrible idea, but they concluded they didn't really have a choice after the medical examiner's testimony was thrown out. And that decision led directly to them losing the case in dramatic fashion.

You pointed out that they hadn't even spoken with Frank before the trial. This is for 2 reasons. First, they took on the case 2 days before the trial, to attempt to help Frank because of the suspected tampering. And second, Frank refused to speak with Matt and Foggy, he would only speak to Karen, because he learned she broke into his home in her own personal, illegal investigation, a place where he hadn't even been since his family died.

"Great video, there are a few points tat I kinda disagree on a bit.

1) 7:59 using castles to make the point that that the russians adopted mongol tactics to me feels to me to be a bit lacking, in that the nature of warfare in the large plains of Russia isn't conducive to building castles and that the usage of cavalry was key. A similar ish story can be told with the usage of cavalry by the Poles (Winged Hussar ftw) which also saw more cavalry and less castles and sieges compared to Western Europe. 

2) On the what-if of the Novgorod Republic - a bit of a disagreement on a conceptual basis in that would a state that developed from the Novgorod republic be ""Russia"" or an entity that we would agree that would take the form similar to that of Russia that we see today? This is very much speculation but would such a state expand into the form of Russia?

3) On the chinese system getting less corrupt as you go up - I don't think less corrupt is the correct term to use here, but more that the incentives of higher officials is very different to that at the provincial level, since at the higher levels their power are in a sense the power of the state, not the power of the individual alone and therefore have to in a sense play along to the rules of the state. Xi jinping cannot rule without the Party, he has control of it now but even the Party will outlive him. The same cannot be said of Putin and whatever structures he uses to maintain power.

On the whole, a lot of what I think made Russia is not just the nature of Mongol rule in Russia (which you also noted seems to be an exception to what Mongols did elsewhere, which was to assimilate), I kinda wonder what made that the case, almost as though Russia was the frontier lands for the Mongols and that characterised the nature of their rule there. And on some level I think the nature of the Russian geography itself drives the logic of how its systems adapt and develope",0.92906648,C,positive

"Russia certainly has an autocratic history, but the idea that meritocracy was irrelevant is absurd. Peter the Great had defective artillery manufacturers test-fire their own cannons, cutting down on corruption there (mostly cheap metal substitution). Everyone competent and useful was promoted, including former Ottoman slaves, like Pushkin's grandfather. The old empire might not have had a strong artisan base, but Peter imported the Volga Deutsch in the 18th century. Catherine later sponsored Euler. Various academies became very prestigious places, and a strong lift for social mobility.

In fact, it's this over-educated (in theories) upper-middle class that really led the Revolution. All the 19th and early 20th century literary classics (Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, Chekhov's plays) all point to an active society with many internal divisions and an active intellectual life.

"Hello, I am a scholar of Russian politics and history and I have to say: well done Kraut! I have to agree with most of this (I also see you have been reading A.N. Sakharov if you reached this conclusion :p). There are a couple of things I would like to add that you didn't mention (although I can understand why, trying to avoid super long videos and all).
1. One of the main things about the mongol invasion was the mass deurbanisation it resulted in. A lot of the economic structures of the Kievan Rus' were the same as the rest of Europe, but the destruction wrought led to a collapse of proto-capitalism in the Russian principalities. This is one of the reasons that the weight of the Rus' moved north-east: as peasants left the cities to settle in the virgin lands of the Finno-uralic peoples (who were mostly semi-nomadic). This lead to an economic recovery that was based in primary industries, as opposed to the post black death recovery which saw a growth in secondary industry. As such, Russia was stunlocked into an agrarianism it didn't break out of properly until WWII. 
2. The introduction of serfdom was, in part, a result of the migration to the north-east: as lords were scared of peasants moving to these virgin lands and thus removing their income (since they had no taxes from secondary industry, due to this kind of proto-deindustrialisation), they instituted serfdom. Sidenote but it is also worth mentioning that Russia had a system of debt slavery alongside serfdom: but this slavery was far more harsh, and allowed non-nobles to acquire labour, which was obviously a threat to the developing boyar class. So this slavery was outlawed but serfdom was universalised.
3. The princes themselves did actually have Veche (local assemblies) as Novgorod did, it was just that they were again a threat to their extractivist rule under the Mongols, so they explicitly used the Mongols to crush them. It wasn't just that the Princes were authoritarian to appease the Mongols, they used their ability to enforce state violence to crush the assemblies that in Europe would develop into parliaments. 
4. On the church, caesaropapism is a big thing but it is also worth mentioning that the power of the church was also destroyed by the Mongol invasion. They had wealth like the catholic church and were accruing political capital (especially since in the divided situation the Kievan states existed as, they were one of the few transnational institutions). The Mongols plundered and destroyed a lot of the wealth the church had, leading to its easy position of subjugation (which is ironic, because it had a lot of cultural capital at the time of Moscow overthrowing the mongol empire, as the one cultural unifier of all the Rus').
5. Finally, there was a point post-Mongols that a parliamentary system could have established itself in Russia. The Zemskiy Sobor during the Time of Troubles had immense power and crowned several Tsars. However it never used that power to give itself power by making the Tsar sign some form of Magna Carta or such, and accepted each time the Tsar wanted absolute authority to rule. To be frank this to this day still puzzles me, because even in the competitive system like what you describe a parliamentary system would have benefitted the Boyars of the Sobor. Still, their failure consigned Russia to the history it had.

They may have conquered the largest area of any army ever, but they did so at a tremendous human cost.

They burned, destroyed and sacked possibly thousands of towns and cities, and enslaved and subjugated the people they conquered.

"The part about north-eastern principalities isn't true. Kiev started to lose its importance since the Rus became more and more fragmented and Kiev needed strong defences provided by a relatively centralized state to avoid nomad raids. + Kiev was the center of many feudal wars so it's people suffered from that too, especially the rural folk.  The climate was also getting warmer at the time which made settling in the north easier. And lastly, the trade routes also changed, so Kiev was gradually losing its status of a trade hub. There's much more to it than just ""Mongols came, Kiev ded"" because many cities were rebuilt and restored much of their previous glory, but not Kiev despite the fact that, if anything, it would've been safer after the invasion since Mongols wouldn't constantly attack and pillage their own tributaries. And yeah, the Russians build wooden fortresses long before the Mongols since the wood was just much more easily accessible",0.86915892,C,positive
"I would like to point out that tethering this north-east migration solely to mongol invasion is a mistake. The migration started a century before the invasion. The reasons were compound: the feudal fragmentation and Cuman raids. The migration of power to north-east was pretty much cemented in 1169 by Mstislav Alexeevich the son of Vladimir-Suzdal principal sacking of Kiev and moving the de facto capital to Vladimir. Kiev still was treated as a de jure seat of the Great Knyaz, but most of them since that time didn't reside there and ruled Kiev by means of appointing vassals. Mongol invasion indeed is important, but don't make it as if it is the only thing. Especially concerning the emergence of north east. It was set to be long before.",0.8502416,C,positive
"It's weird you portray the Veche assembly as purely a good thing for its checks and balances, while ignoring the problems caused by the late Rus Princedoms prior to the mongol invasion. The decentralization of the Kievan Rus and the constant squabbling between city-state elites is often cited as one of the main reasons why the Rus was smashed by the mongols so easily. The height of the Veche's folly was shown during the life of Prince Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod when he was expelled from the city for being 'bad for business', only to be begged to return and defend the city after the Veche came to realize just how dangerous the baltic crusaders were.
Fact was that the power of the nobility needed to be taken down a notch, and while Ivan the 'Terrible' may have gone too far he was of the right direction. Had it not been for his centralization (continued by Peter's reforms in the Table of Ranks), Russia may have become as disasterously liberal as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, with its idiotic Golden Liberty and Liberum Veto leading to a century of utter stagnation.
If anything, Russian autocracy often lacked a true autocrat, hence why serfdom took so long to abolish -- multiple Tsars considered it only to shrink back due to the displeasure of the aristocracy. Could have used another Peter to go on a beard-chopping spree.",0.53756309,C,neutral

Everything leads me to believe he has a vested interest in making and selling vaccines over everything else, and well, it's hard to argue against that when his entire foundation is built on doing exactly that.

I am a journalist and an 'old guy' who enjoyed participating in the ""social revolution"" of the sixties. The concerns you express about corporate self-interest and the impariments of the profit motive specifically related to drug programs (such things obviously happen everywhere) was a point of discussion 60 years ago during our ""revolution"" (It was a ways down the list that started with ending war, striving for peace  and I think ""free love"" came next). My point to you and others is that this topic is regurgitated routinely, like the contents of a cow's second stomach, but the the system's inherit dysfuction around it somehow happily sustains. My great concern these days is about complacency that seems to be at the heart of the human condition and allows such things to carry on - whether it is about climate change or allowing Putin and his ilk to be murderous brutes.

""" Two years ago, NDP MP Jenny Kwan protested that the federal Liberals were directing less than one per cent of their social housing budget to B.C., despite the province being home to 11 per cent of the nation__ population.

The stark imbalance has improved since Kwan aired her complaints.

But the Vancouver East NDP MP says British Columbians, who struggle with some of the costliest housing on the continent and high homelessness rates, still do not receive their legitimate share of social-housing funds. The vast majority continues to go to vote-rich Ontario.

__t was shocking to learn that in January, 2020, B.C. was so severely shortchanged by the federal government for our fair share of social housing and shelter funding from the National Housing Strategy__ Co-Investment Fund, the only federal social housing program at the time,_ Kwan said.

__ince exposing that B.C. only got 0.5 per cent of the funding, I__ glad to report that more funds have begun to flow to B.C._

Kwan, the NDP__ housing critic, is not alone in being appalled at the historically tiny level of non-profit housing money trickling in to B.C. The province__ former premier, Mike Harcourt, said last week the federal Liberals made a huge mistake in 1993 when they cancelled such housing programs.

Now non-profit housing is needed more than ever, including because of widespread B.C. homelessness and addiction, Harcourt said, adding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau__ new record high immigration targets for Canada are also placing extra intense pressure on housing and prices.

Compared to the meagre 0.5 per cent of funds that B.C. received in the past for social housing, Kwan__ office provided government data showing the proportion of such money that went to the province, based on figures from early last year, bumped up to 5.7 per cent.

That amounted to $135 million in grants and loans to B.C. from the National Housing Strategy__ Co-Investment Fund, an arm of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

In the meantime, Kwan__ assistant provided figures showing Ontario was last year getting 86 per cent of the fund__ money, for a total of $1.3 billion. Alberta was worse off than B.C., drawing only 1.8 per cent.

When Kwan took into account additional Co-Investment Fund funding from Ottawa that has been __ommitted,_ meaning promised based on certain conditions that had to be fulfilled, she said the proportion potentially heading to B.C. last year jumped to 8.6 per cent of the total or $266 million. Ontario, with three times the population, was apportioned $2.4 billion.

__hile this is a marked improvement from 0.5 per cent,_ Kwan said, __t is still not enough. We still fall short on a per capita basis, which is 11 per cent._

Although the federal Liberals in 2017 announced __ith great fanfare_ a new national housing strategy, including by declaring that __dequate housing is a basic human right,_ Kwan said the housing crisis is only getting worse.

While Harcourt praised Kwan for drawing attention to B.C.__ past shortfall, the one-time Vancouver mayor laments how former prime minister Jean Chretien__ decision to kill Ottawa__ non-profit housing program, which had been producing 25,000 lower-cost units a year (including many in Vancouver), resulted in 600,000 subsidized homes never being constructed.

__ow the Liberals_ increase of immigration levels from 250,000 to 400,000 newcomers per year means we need a massive catch-up and a well-funded federal housing program, partnered with provincial funding initiatives,_ said Harcourt, noting 75 per cent of immigrants move to either Montreal, Toronto or Vancouver.

When Postmedia asked federal Housing Minister Ahmed Hussen whether he believes B.C. receives a fair portion of social-housing money, officials did not offer an opinion or release figures on finalized payments to B.C.

Instead, CMHC media relations officer Leonard Catling said the latest figures, from March, indicate $899 million has been promised based on certain condition that have yet to be fulfilled, to B.C. applicants through the Co-Investment Fund to build or repair 6,800 affordable homes. Out of a national fund of $5.3 billion, that__ works out to 16 per cent for B.C.

The federal government__ Place to Call Home website, Catling said, provides more information on how the federal government is providing additional funds to applicants from B.C. and elsewhere for such things as building rental housing and subsidizing the rents of __arginalized groups with low incomes._

Jill Atkey, head of the B.C. Non-profit Housing Association, said she__ encouraged to see increased federal investment in affordable housing, including through the CMHC__ co-investment arm. __owever, the rental affordability crisis is worse in B.C. than anywhere else in the country and investments need to match that need. We are not there yet._

Since land prices are so high in B.C., especially in urban areas, Atkey said the amount of federal money going into building low-cost housing in the province does not go nearly as far as it would in other parts of the country.

For his part, Harcourt, who recently wrote a Vancouver Sun commentary arguing the city of Vancouver should increase density while avoiding __verdeveloping_ certain neighbourhoods, praised the B.C. government__ pledge to work with the private sector to create about 11,000 affordable housing units a year.

Ottawa, he said, needs to be supporting the construction of 7,000 more non-profit units each year for the province.

The demand is urgent.""

Whenever I try to introduce modern vegetables or out of season fruit I literally feel aches, brain fog and generally lower mood whereas when I focus on eating large amounts of meat (500g to 1kg per day) I literally feel like my best self. We all must ask the question of: is the antimeat agenda pushed out of profit or will the top 1% also be foregoing their meat because it's objectively inferior? Deep down we all know the real answer.

"There was an incident a couple of decades ago in which a police officer in Australia, pulled over a couple on a state motorway. The man was an ex-con who started struggling with the officer at the roadside, fighting and biting him. The woman managed to get hold of the cop's baton and started hitting him as he fought with her boyfriend, then the boyfriend started trying to grab the cop's gun from his holster. The cop managed to win the struggle for the gun despite being bitten by the man and struck repeatedly with the baton by the woman. He shot the man literally point blank in the torso, killing him. The bullet passed clean through and hit and disabled the woman. By chance I was talking with some people at a social event some months after the story was in the news. A woman in the group had been a prison officer for a while. She said ""Oh yes, I knew the man who was killed. He was one of the inmates I had charge of at times. I knew it was him the second I read that story because he always was a biter."" A few years later, my vehicle broke down on the same motorway and I happened to roll to a halt about 100 metres ahead of a cop doing a traffic stop. About 15 minutes later he'd finished the stop and he drove up and pulled in near me to ask what was wrong. I explained I'd broken down and had already called the breakdown service. Then I saw his badge and recognised his name from the news stories. I said ""Hey, you're the guy who had the fight with the biter."" He sort of stiffened and said ""What of it?"" I replied ""Nothing. Just good work, man."" and told him I was glad he carried on being a cop, then I changed the subject because I could tell he was uncomfortable with it. Nice guy.

"I was once part of an apprenticeship that demanded survival of the fittest. They wanted to compete against many training programs in a market recovery move. The first few years were about what you would expect being the low guy on the ladder and handling all the lifting and grunt work even if you aren't an Olympian. After several years of training and into our final year we were given a hype speech and told these are the jobs few have the guts to do to and start acting like we had graduated and pushing back on anyone who would give us any shit on the job. It was time to dish back what was dished out because thin skin had no place on a job site. We were trained to face death every day. Not exactly what I was expecting when I signed up but all the training was supportive and encouraging up to that point. Yet the reaction of some others to your indestructible courage was anger. You would think it would earn you respect but that's not always the case. Some would be determined to break you. Those who were supposed to be leaders were more like competitors. I had my final injury while working that finally broke my body. My core collapsed and so did my legs and back. I went through years of feeling like I had a beating by the end of every day. Back breaking labor was just part of the risks. Maybe the most broken tools with the most difficult method isn't the challenge you should be accepting from the boss. Maybe you need to call out the bullshit when you get given broken tools with broken gear.  We were also trained we need to go home alive at the end of the day. You don't want to end up as broken as the poor supplies you were provided by a cheap employer who sees you as a temporary number. Right there I'm getting worked up about it again but part of it was getting put down to test your nerve. Labor disputes are still a thing today and likely always will be. There is a proper tool for the job. There is a proper approach to quality work. This courage and knowledge can be threatening to others though the right team would appreciate your tenacity. Like-ability is also as important as being aggressive. If you can manage both that's another skill. I've heard many talks about leadership and attitude so I humbly appreciate what the experienced have to say about it. I use that as fuel to overcome what facing fears can do to you or your body , mind and integrity while your down and recovering. Surviving something is a different kind of suck.

I'd almost started to think I was the only person who felt this way and what's worse thought maybe something was fundamentally wrong with me because of it.

I've learned it's absolutely the opposite. I have young women on my team who learned to trust their point of view, look for the good in others, treat every person as if you don't know what they may be going through.. So on and so on.  We are not corporate favorites because it's hard for us the talk the talk. The important thing is that we actually walk the walk, which is ironically what ""they"" say they need from us but they have no idea how to or don't care to cultivate an environment that actually rewards or at minimum acknowledges this.

"EDITING CREDITS BELOW: Had a bit of a nightmare with this one, but it__ over, sorry any voice inconsistencies, don__ have a good recording environment currently (but on working it)

ADDITIONAL CAVEATS:

John Swan__ part got the age of which Shiloh alleges Greg assaulted her in Pennsylvania, he says it was 16, she messaged him to tell him it was 17. This doesn__ change the legality (or illegality), but worth clarifying. Apparently Pennsylvania has contradictory laws regarding aoc, which I find confusing, but I will put my trust in John.

John Swan: ""I also unintentionally blurred the line between 'proof' and 'evidence' so I'll be sure to clarify that in the future.  Testimonies can be used as 'evidence' but they cannot always be used as 'proof,' as a criminal defence lawyer would argue admissibility and has a good chance of winning.""

"We have one of these truck ramps installed  on the road above the town where I live.  It's called a Catch Net System.  Over the past 14 years, it has been used 7 times.  It works.  All of the truck drivers who were forced to use this ramp walked away without a scratch.  Five other drivers who lost their brakes and chose not to use the ramp all died. 

I do not know what the initial cost was to build the thing, but I do know that the cost to repair it and put it back in operation is approximately $13,000 per gate.  Which the truckers insurance company pays for.  The trucks that have used it, have went through between 3 and 7 gates, depending on there speed and how heavy the load was, before they came to a stop.

The time to repair the gates and have it back in operation again is about 30 minutes per gate.  The damage to the truck is minimal, usually  the front bumper is bent and the fiberglass hood is cracked and broken.  The small amount of damage to the truck is quite surprising.

To all those that say a gravel ramp would be a lot cheaper.  I agree, but in our case, we did not have  the option of putting in a gravel ramp.  The road runs down through a canyon with a 8% grade, a mountain on one side and a steep drop off on the other.",0.83857739,C,positive

He donated to their campaigns as a businessman and hosted them at his properties. Even as a sitting president he promoted policies that would benefit these people.

"""This man was my uncle. I'm not going to give any names, but for those of you who are concerned with how things turned out for him, not well. 

There's so much to address here. First let me say that he was being treated in this video with meds. Without the medication his mood ranged from complete delusion to catatonic. As for being gay, I don't think he had much of a sex drive at all. With or without meds. As for the idea that he was put here because he was gay by some unloving family, that's ridiculous. I don't have time to say all the things my family tried just to make his existence somewhat peaceful just for his own sake. My family had a couple of openly homosexual and lesbians in it even back in the sixties and with the exception of my mother's father no one gave a shit. 

My uncle suffered with meds and even more without. After forty some odd years, most of which he spent in institutions, he took his own life by way of drug overdose. 
By the way, the comment about the plot twist, he never had a piano was funny because he didn't. His seeming obsession with piano came and went as did obsessions with religion, especially the Catholic Church and government. As far as I know he couldn't play a lick.

 He was very ill at his best and a living shell at his worst. I hope that answers some questions because that's all I have to say on the matter. He's been gone since the late eighties and I really hope that other members of my family don't see this video, mostly because of the comments from people that somehow think they understand him better than the people who suffered with him.
 One last thing, I think people thought that he was talking about sitting or standing effeminately or something. No, he was talking about sitting or standing motionless for hours. Usually not even his facial expression would change but when it did it was usually related to something in his mind only. I really can't begin to tell you all how heartbreaking the whole thing was. He did seem intelligent and with meds he did remind me of a high functioning guy with autism I once met.""

1. CONTROL THE FRAME WITH BODY LANGUAGE & TONE: If someone talk to you aggressively make sure you don__ respond to their emotional state. Stay cool, calm & Respond not rising to it. Which means you set the frame not other person
2. WHEN IN CONFRONTATION, ATTACK THE FRAME, NOT THE CONTENT: The less you focus on defending yourself the better your banter will become. Don__ try to win every critical exchange.
3. HAVE THE BELIEF THAT YOU ARE NOT THERE TO IMPRESS: If you are sells person or on a client facing role if you shift your mindset from I am selling this person or I work for this person to this person need me to partner with them. This means you will push back when needed, you will give better advice.
4. BECOME AN EXPERT AT FRAMING PEOPLE__ OPTIONS: You don__ need to have total control just control the options and the person who controls the options controls the outcome
5. CREATE OPTIONS FOR YOURSELF: Believe & show that you can always get different path, client, job if someone closes the door for you.

It was a historic period in our history that those of who experienced it were lucky to be alive, sad as it was.   Thank you, Mr. Dean, for everything you've done.",0.88990825,C,positive
"I greatly admire John Dean. His testimony before the Senate investigating committee was riveting, and he was the only witness who came across as candid and truthful.

Dean puts all the conversations into context, which finally makes the conversations understandable.",0.98153472,C,positive

"There are many videos that look back on Watergate and, ""All The President's Men."" This is the finest I've seen as it clearly demonstrates the partnership of Woodward & Bernstein in what it actually is in conjunction with the screen adaptation of their reporting in The Washington Post. Robert Redford discusses his, ""obsession"" with Watergate and the creative desire to make the film. Interesting to observe how the reporters and a film actor found a way to come together and eventually find a mutual respect for one another in their individual fields of expertise as well as a desire to tell the truth. The film and the events of Watergate continue to fascinate me. Though many may feel that these events are purely for the history books, we can still learn a lot from the way people sought the truth and apply it to these troubled times.",0.99001288,C,positive

"In 1964, the 1st thing I had to do after reporting to Army Basic Training was to take written tests.  At the time, I thought this was an IQ test, but recently learned that it's more of a Vocation Evaluation which is similar, yet different.  All the tests had time limits and were multiple guess. The average GI score is 100, and without knowing anything about ways of getting high scores, I scored 137. I was placed into typing school and was assigned clerk typist because I could read, write, and type 13 words/minute. In 1968, I was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and got to know a crew chief (I'll call Joe) who would answer my questions about the workings of various parts of the chopper. I perceived that Joe was smart and always had correct answers to my questions.
About a year later, I went to Italy and found that Joe and I were in the same unit. One day, Joe told me he wanted to apply for promotion to Aircraft Maintenance Warrant Officer, but he told me he had only scored 90 on his tests.  The minimum score to apply for Warrant Officer was 115, and Joe asked if I had any suggestions?  I told him that I had learned that the final score was the average of the Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Math scores.  I had also learned that only correct answers counted. I told Joe to find out what was the time limit for each test. I told Joe to start reading books on any subject he liked to improve his vocabulary and reading comprehension.  For the math test, I told Joe to do all of the easiest problems first and skip the difficult ones. If he got to the end of the test with time remaining, go back and work on the problems he had skipped.  When he had only a minute remaining, just mark everything remaining as ""C"".
About six months later, a very happy and excited Joe told me he had passed the tests with a score of 129 and was applying for Warrant Officer appointment. I got out of the Army shortly after that.

You are naturally competent to do so as our ancestors were, and that is something that our current education system doesn't recognize; that self-learning IS the highest order of intelligence, and thus by definition creative, as it does not rely on education to begin with. It relies un natural understanding from silence, introspection and resillience to give up. From a healthy point of survival, creativity must be met with a certain hardship, or there was no friction releasing any energy for growth. Any lifeform just understands it's own intelligence and works out the hardships it will face in life, or die. Which are all unique if you believe in the concept of relativity and time and beyond matter; no one person will solve your problems your way, or has a book on all the problems they solved with their ""education"". Cognition is layered, just like logic, so just give up on the hubris-control of ""intelligence"". You are as intelligent as you have always been, and that's a problem no education can solve.

That this must be considered actual science.  Of course, the classroom of people she was speaking to all burst out in laughter at her comment, but she stuck by it.  That is what decolonizing means to them.  I posit that if someone want to decolonize themselves from Western thought and civilization, they should have the freedom to do so as long as it includes the rejection of ALL Western benefits.  You cannot call for decolonization and pick and choose what you want to accept as OKAY Western thought & civilization.  One cannot call for decolonization of education and then pursue a post doctoral degree in a subject.  The pursuit of a degree in and of itself is Western, thus it must be excluded as not an option for someone who is decolonized.  Likewise, if you call for decolonizing Western medicine and health practices, then having healthcare is part and parcel of that Westernization.  You cannot pick and choose what you want to keep and then call for decolonization for others to suit selfish ignorant opportunities.

"Here are my notes:
*Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back*

_ Read the great clinicians: Jung, Freud, Adler, Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow + Skinner (behaviourist).

_ The neuropsychology of anxiety _ Jeffrey Grey (1800 papers worth of understanding!

_ Affective neuroscience _ Yak Pengsak (rats laugh).

_ Lobsters and serotonin (status, emotional regulation & posture). 

_ Competence (intelligence and confronting fears with courage) define hierarchies.

_ Confidence gives you the benefit of the doubt, for better emotional regulation + being taken seriously. 

*Treat Yourself Like You__e Someone You__e Caring For*

_ Jung says it__ an invitation for reciprocity _ people will treat you exactly how you want them to, you need to define this (the golden rule)!

_ How would you like your child to be treated?

_ People are fragile, prone to temptation and imperfect, which often gets worse, and capable of malevolence _ this is why we don__ like ourselves.

_ Love the sinner but hate the sin!

_ Taking care of yourself is a moral obligation to humanity, you have a light to bring into the world!

*Make Friends With People Who Want The Best For You*

_ People that aim down while you aim up are toxic (this can be part of you too).

_ You have an ethical responsibility to surround yourself with the best people that support your needs.

_ Be careful about who you share good/bad news with (jealousy and habit perpetuation).

_ Bad people don__ think life isn__ worth it, they demonstrate to themselves there is no necessity to strive forward by putting you down.

*Compare Yourself To Who You Were Yesterday, Not Who Someone Is Today*

_ Know Dostoevsky novels (crime and punishment _ murderer gets away with it [see don__ let you children_]).

_ Pareto distribution _ height, weight and intelligence are normally distributed.

_ Creative products are distributed in a Pareto distribution.

_ If you run a company, 80% of the employees do 20% of the work, 20% of customers are responsible for 80% of calls and sales.

_ In a given domain, the square root of a particular group of people do half the amount of work.

_ Matthew principle: To those who have everything, more will be given. From those who have nothing, everything will be taken away. 

_ Consider this in terms of opportunity. 

_ There is always going to be someone around who is better than you.

_ Jung thought the Book of Revelation was a pendant to the Bible, because the Christ in Gospels was too merciful. An ideal is always a judge. Revelation has Christ coming back as a judge. 

_ You need an ideal because you have nothing to aim at, but an ideal is a judge and you will always fall short of the ideal. 

_ Set a high aim, then break the goal down into parts that are challenging enough to push yourself past where you are, but not crushingly distant (reasonable probability of success).

_ At 30, the idiosyncrasies of your life make comparison futile as accomplishments are tailored by factors.

_ Make today some tiny increment better than yesterday.

_ Goals need to be laid out to justify life__ suffering.

_ Nietzsche says, __e who has a why can bear almost any how_.

*Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them*

_ Freudian nightmare: Circle where people are squeezing each other__ necks hard enough to strangle them in twenty years.

_ Carl Jung: The shadow (dark side of humanity) has roots reaching all the way to hell.

_ Literal & metaphysical application _ the very worst and then more proximal kinds of hell.

_ If you understand your dark side, you will see in yourself a reflection of the darkest potential. People don__ want to see this so they don__, but this confrontation is an inevitable barrier to enlightenment.

_ Joseph Campbell: __ollow your bliss_

_ Jung: __ursue what__ meaningful and you__l encounter that which you least want to encounter_.

_ God of Horus (Egypt) was a God, but lost an eye in the battle when encountering evil. The Egyptian eye is that lost to Seth, the precursor to Satan.

_ Nietzsche punishment: don__ punish people when they do something wrong, this is a moral relief to them. Wait until they do something good, then hurt them.

_ When people do something you wish to be replicated, reward them!

_ Consult your irritability to prevent conflict and shape the times when others hurt.

_ Children must be socially desirable by four, we develop by playing! Adults like developed kids.

*Set Your House In Order Before Your Criticise The World*

_ Carl Panzram _ Panzram (autobiography) _ __urry up you bastard, I could kill ten men in the time if takes you to hang me_.

_ Columbine kids diaries _ why did the kids shoot up the school?

_ The above were judges of being as motivated by resentment.

_ You must admit to resentment, its fantasies and the way out.  

_ A resentful person wants others to change are not to be trusted.

_ TS Eliot: The cocktail party _ __ hope that there__ something wrong with me_.

_ If I don__ like life, is my judgement to be trusted if I haven__ done everything I possibly can to set life right?

_ The Gulag Archipelago _ Solzhenitsyn. One man that stopped lying could spread the dissolution of the Soviet Empire.

_ GO over your life with a fine-tooth comb and determine when you took the wrong path when not shieled by ignorance. Take responsibility for where you are, what increased the probability that you came here and what would happen if set everything right in the present. 

_ Try not doing the things you shouldn__ do, not saying the things you know aren__ true (Mandela agrees).

Do What Is Meaningful, Not What Is Expedient

_ The Messiah takes the world__ sins upon Himself _ associated with Jung__ shadow. 

_ The terror that comes in the night <- book about sleep paralysis.

_ Ordinary men _ bourgeois police battalion moved into Poland, but told they could go back to Germany if it was too hard for them. They were sickened by what they did but didn__ stop (don__ compartmentalise this!)

_ For there to stop being Nazis, know that the Nazis were you, then decide not to do that.

*Assume That The Person You Are Listening To Knows Something That You Don__*

_ Humility: What you don__ know is more important that what you know. There is more of what you don__ know in the world and your life isn__ what it could be. Make the identification of ignorance your friend!

_ Listen to people: Use wisdom as tools _ do you want to be right or learning?

_ People will tell you what is wrong in their life and how to fix that!

_ Engrossing conversations are transformative!

_ People think by talking_ what do you want? 

_ Use others as a foil for your thoughts.

_ Carl Rogers dictum (a trick to tell if you__e listening): someone lays out their thoughts, then you say, __ook here__ what I think you said_, is that right. You summarise their argument for them, and you don__ get to make them into a strawman. 

_ Don__ win the argument, fix the damn problem.

_ The misery of fixing the problem is worth evading the misery of not. What are you running both to and away from in your life?

_ Also listen to your enemies and how they criticise you.

*Don__ Bother Children When They__e Skateboarding*

_ __trong men are dangerous and hierarchies are built on power and society is a tyrannical patriarchy_ _ historically ignorant. 

_ eBay proved the Western society is built on honesty. 

_ Success is built upon conscientiousness. 

_ Last 1800s, Nietzsche announced the death of god in the decimation of the divine masculine. 

_ Adopt responsibility for your life, your failure to participate in being leaves a hole in the cultural landscape. 

_ Restricting children__ play is a pathological inhibition of our fundamentally honest light.

*Pet A Cat When You Encounter It On The Street*

_ In overwhelming crisis or illness, shorten your timeframe until it can be coped with (the power of the present!). 

_ You can put up with a whole lot and not be corrupted.

_ Be alert to the unexpected beauty in life.

_ Be grateful for what you have and sustain yourself whether you__e successful or not. 

_ If we didn__ all attempt to make terrible things worse than they already are, then maybe we could tolerate the suffering we have to and make the world a better place!

*EXTRA*

_ Do not cast pearls before swine _ New Testament. If people are not listening to you, stop talking. Watch them instead, they will tell you what they__e up to. By offering what you have to say to those who reject it, you are devaluing what you are saying.

_ Look into John Taylor Gatto _ the relationship between the classic Trivium and the Holy Trinity and how has that changed over time.

_ Ideals recede as you approach them. A good person is someone who is attempting to be better.

_ Christ is the dying and resurrecting hero. You learn things painfully. In this, a part of you has to die. Life is a constant process of death and rebirth. The thing that emerges in the place of dead wood is worthy. 

_ Until the entire world is redeemed, we all fall short.",0.91892773,C,positive
"Last year I attempted suicide. I was newly single and jobless. I was living out of my truck and extremely lonely. I couldn't even afford data on my phone to properly communicate with the outside world, or my mother in England (I live in NZ). One day, when I was sitting outside a cafÃ©, using their free wifi, I saw a suggested video pop up of a ""Jordan Peterson Owns..."" I clicked on it. It was entertaining. That led me to watch other videos of his and soon I found out that he wasn't just someone who puts people in their place- but a loving, caring man with great wisdom and knowledge on how to fix the mess I called my life. I parked outside that same cafÃ© every night for a couple of weeks and I've been obsessed with his teachings ever since. I know he hears this a lot; and for good reason, but this man has literally saved my life. I keep his book on me like a bible and I revisit old lectures all the time. I'm no longer suicidal. I'm not longer homeless. 
I have a room to clean. 
Thank you, Dr. Peterson.

"I had to rewatch this series of debates and listen to Peterson's lectures on Maps and Meaning and his biblical series before I could even attempt to comment, but here goes:

I think the main point that Peterson was trying to convey to Harris was that religion appears to have developed organically over the course of human history as a way to preserve and communicate abstract ideas and concepts that can reduce suffering and promote success in life in those who act them out. He tends to define these ideas and concepts as values (e.g. fairplay, honesty, etc), which we use in our daily lives as a moral compass for our actions. As a personal example, I train jiu jitsu every morning at 6 AM because I value physical fitness, fairplay, and strategy, which I hope will ultimately help me in my endeavor to live a meaningful life. The act of doing something we value is in Peterson's definition, religious. Therefore, he assets that even atheists tend to live a religious life because they act on values that they hold dear to their person.

Harris seems to assert that we as humans, have the ability to extract the same values that Peterson defined without the need for interpretation of the stories in religious texts like the bible. On top of that, he cites that dogmatic and literal interpretation of some stories has shown to be disastrous throughout history-responsible for war and death. There are plenty of examples such as the Inquisition, the anabaptist revolt in Muenster, the Buddhist/Hindu civil war in Sri Lanka, and ISIS. Therefore, I believe Harris concludes that if we can assume that humans can synthesize the ""good"" values in life without the need for religion, we should- the risk is otherwise too great.

Peterson's counter claim is that it is likely impossible for humans to be able to do away with religion and synthesize our own values. He's cited Nietzsche and post modernists like Derrida or Foucault often, claiming that social systems such as communism fail to address human impulsive tendencies and propensities for evil, which are not values, per se, but are addressed as vital and fundamental parts of most ( I say most because I'm not qualified to assert all) of the world's religions. Therefore, Peterson concludes that there remains significant value in respecting and acting out religious logos because they also help to recognize and reduce acts of malice.

So they're talking past each other, in some sense. I think the real question is: Assuming Peterson and Harris are correct, how can we implement religions without devolving into literal interpretations? I think they found the answer when they agreed to it at the beginning- free and frank speech.

I wonder if anyone will read this....",0.86412543,C,positive

What is sad is the man I Love made me homeless, living in a shelter since I sold my house, Had The man I love steal part of the money, my jewelry. Belongings. And and thing he wanted. Believing he really loved me. Breaking my nose in a hotel. Dieing in the ambulance. Having the cops hospital myself all covering it up. Then have the hospital take My Drive license more jewelry and other things as well. Having A chair that was in my house before I sold the house, place at a batter woman shelter. Where I ended up at. Buying a car from the man I love. Paying more then he asked for. Then not getting The title to the car. Having the cop's tow the car away because he told them to. Because he new I was happy living in it. So I was again forced to go live back in a shelter. He controls all the shelter's here in the USA and in other countries. I found out about so much. Now he angry I am finally speaking about what has happened to myself. He has done this to so many people. Male and females. I'm not the Only human who this man did this to. Here in the USA the hospital, shelter's and the man I Love is a group of People who is targeting to control and do experiments on. Go read the book medical partied. There getting paid for doing different experiments. To see what humans Will do in different situations. They get paid very large amounts of money to keep these experiments going on. Just think how much hospital's get for put you in the hospital. The cop's get paid above and beyond their salary. To cover this behavior up. And the shelters homeless shelters that is and battered women's shelters and battered men shelters. Get paid a very lot to keep people homless. Then they're watching controlling what everyone is doing. And getting paid. You read exactly right.

Right around Christmas when my Father Lord Jesus Christ birthday is, I remember that when I was in The battered women's shelter. I learned to speak out about what took place in my relationship with the Man I Love, the hospitals the police. and to tell the truth. The Man  I Love controls YouTube. There was so many readers reading tarot cards, now not as many the higher elite got rid of them. I was to keep my mouth closed, to just pretend nothing is going on.

Crypto is arguably one of the most important parts of modern society. We__e in the midst of building the foundation of future law, politics and monitory systems, yet only a few people participate in the movement, probably because of the threshold for understanding internet, web, finance, global economics, crypto etc. 
This format invites a lot of people to start seeing things they never though about, but inevitably(probably) will be reliant on in the future. 
Not understanding crypto is like not understanding the creation of law & governance. In this stage of development, you have the opportunity to make a difference in how it will be structured & presented to the world. How will future digitalized generations interact with politics, money and governance?

And the same is applied to the scientists who arrogantly debate in absolutes. The religious figures, as much as they reference their religious books or engage logical arguments, cannot prove the existence of God. Similarly, scientists who adopt an atheistic belief, as much as they use scientific references and engage logical arguments, cannot disprove the existence of God. Hence, when debating origins of existence, arguments based on absolutes only relay the arrogance and ignorance of the debaters.",0.6049937,C,neutrally positive

From there all it had to do was clone itself like many chemicals already do. Then, with quadrillions of viruses,  some mutated,  some were damaged, some incorporated other chemicals,  some seemingly ate each other and started organelles.

John Connolly's wife, Nellie, sat in front of JFK in the limo, as Gov. Connolly sat in front of Jackie, though later, on their way to the Brooks Air Force Base, John Connolly switched seats with Jackie and was seated beside JFK._The wives sat in front of Pres. Kennedy and Gov. Connolly. To potential snipers lying in wait, this would have been_a logistical nightmare for the would-be assassins, positioned_in front of the limo since_it increased the chances the wives could be hit by gun fire, something LBJ and his conspirators would not have desired.


Little wonder the assassins did not take a chance on shooting JFK during the_motorcade in downtown San Antonio, what with_the first lady of Texas sitting directly in the line of fire in front of JFK because if bullets were fired at JFK either from behind or in front of the limo or even from a side angle, chances were very good Mrs. Connolly could have been shot in the cross fire, as turned out to be the case in Dallas when her husband, John, caught a bullet intended for JFK._


Assuming JFK's murder was orchestrated by the one man who had the most to gain by it; Lyndon Johnson, the assassination team_possibly composed of rogue CIA agents and elements of the Chicago Mafia that were_ designated to be the hit team for the San Antonio presidential motorcade had no choice but to remain silently in their sniper's nests in downtown San Antonio, their rifles quiet, knowing that they (or the next assassination team in Dallas) would still have another shot at Kennedy_in the next motorcade that was scheduled for Dealey Plaza. 


This time Johnson made sure John Connolly; not his wife,_would be seated_in front of JFK. Johnson_likely_quietly ordered_the head of JFK's_Secret Service detail to make sure Mrs. Connolly would not be seated in front of JFK for the Dallas trip, which is what occurred._She inadvertently spoiled the assassin's chances of getting JFK in San Antonio by sitting in front of the president. The assassins could not afford to take a chance on killing a woman, the Governor's wife, even though they came very close to hitting Jackie in Dallas._


Even if Gov. Connolly was shot accidentally during the next trip to Dallas, still it would not be his wife who would be hit. Has this point ever been brought up? The crystal clear video of the San Antonio_trip, captured on film, is in stark contrast to the grainy film seen on the_Zapruder film of JFK's murder._I also find the audio of the cheering crowds very interesting because we can't hear a thing with the silent Zapruder film, as important as it is._


Having had sniper training in the Air Force, I was drilled on shooting at targets from a variety of positions, so I am kind of approaching this line of thought from the mindset of the killers and what would work best for them and what would not work to their advantage._The assassins could only_imagine what might Johnson_have done to them if they_accidentally shot any of the women in the motorcade. 


Now in considering all this; I have to ask, was there another fall guy, another patsy like Lee Oswald waiting in the wings, who was duped by the CIA into working in a building somewhere in downtown San Antonio in who Kennedy's murder could be blamed on, had JFK been shot and killed in San Antonio? Was there a revolving cast of sacrificial lambs Johnson situated in the various Texas cities Kennedy's motorcades went through? 


Because no matter where JFK was going to be killed, the conspirators_had to have plans in place for_ redirecting_blame for the president's murder on a lone gunman to persuade the public JFK's murder was not part of a larger, darker plot. Of course, the question is always, why?_Kennedy would never have launched the US into a massive war in Vietnam. But Johnson_had much to gain financially from the military industrial complex that President Eisenhower_warned about in one of his last speeches as president. 


His warning meant to convey this, that some men, in the position of president of the US, could be bribed by the military contractors and oil billionaires to keep their industries going strong financially through continued government support and contracts and this has sometimes occurred through America's involvement in_war, enough times to keep these businesses flourishing as our tax dollars keep rolling into their pockets to keep America a military might._


Already wealthy by the time he became president, Kennedy did not need the bribes that another man might drool for._Kennedy did not want his legacy as president to be one built on blood but progress. But_Lyndon Johnson's long and brutal, bloody war in Vietnam showed us a man much different from JFK",0.44032833,C,neutral

"I saw Star Wars in the theater when it was first released in 1977. I was the target age Lucas was aiming for and I already was a fan of science fiction/fantasy movies (King Kong, Ray Harryhausen, Sinbad movies, Godzilla, Universal monsters).

I remember the first image I ever saw of Star Wars. It was in a magazine given out in school called Scholastic Magazine. It was a small B/W picture of the stormtrooper on the giant lizard. It reminded me of a gorilla soldier on horseback from Planet of the Apes (of which I was also a big fan). It was the only thing I could compare it to. Prior to that I knew nothing about Star Wars. I was wondering what it actually was I'm looking at. Whatever it was, it was cool and I had to see it. When I did see it, I was blown away. Last time I was blown away by a movie in the theater was Jaws two years earlier (where I also became a John Williams fan with Jaws being the first record album I ever owned. Now he composed the music for this Star Wars which I also got on 8 track).

As far as Star Wars goes today. I guess I'm all Star Wars'd out. I'm simply not interested anymore, especially with the new stuff. One of the things I loved about Star Wars was its 'mystique'.

"Here's why Lucas' Star Wars endures; there's always new things to see that spark the imagination, and each saga episode goes deeper into its own lore - the second death star is a completely different battle, because Luke has to go *inside* and face his own dark side - the stakes are totally different. People think these movies are basic movies of good vs evil, but the writing is about how we *choose* whether to be good or evil. It's all interconnected, whether you agree with the choices or not. It's constructed to tap deep into our psychology. As Lucas said, it's not about space ships, and lots of imitators failed in thinking that.

The Disney sequels are completely surface level, to the point they mimic ideas and scenes without the dramatic weight underneath them. Example; in ANH Luke has to choose between being out for himself (like Owen and Han) or part of a bigger world (like Obi-Wan and Leia), and those philosophical stakes get a dramatic reversal when Han is leaving with his reward, and then comes back to *save* Luke. We also have faith (Vader, Obi-Wan) vs technology (Han, Tarkin). That's why the climax of the movie resonates so much.

We don't get this in TFA, because Rey nobody had nobody to talk to except a mystery box. The first time Kylo and Luke meet on screen, Luke apologises and dies. The first time Han and Kylo meet on screen, Han apologises and gets killed. The sequels are about fractured mentor/apprentice relationships, and not even done with any real setup. It's not what people come to Star Wars for. The other crime is when the sequels make fun of the Star Wars galaxy and have it laughing at itself - Lucas never did that. It is very goofy at times, with pratfalls etc, but characters don't make fun of their galaxy, and most of the silliness is limited to droids and aliens.

Luke gets saved by Han in the climax of ANH, saved by Leia, Chewie & Lando at the end of ESB, and saved by his father in the climax of ROTJ, yet for the sequels Luke was the ""legend, blinded by his own hubris""? OK, then...

Lucas, for all the mockery he gets, was always imaginative and subversive (in a good way). As Marcia Lucas has said, on the record, Lucasfilm and KK don't understand what they're doing. I don't think we can classify her as a 'toxic fan' or ""man baby"". The Mandalorian was a big hit because it was much closer to the vision of Lucas, and Favreau and Filoni have a much clearer concept of what it is; fatherhood (and/or chosen family), compassion vs greed/fear, choosing to do the right thing. You don't even need Jedi or lightsabers to make popular Star Wars stories.

People think of the saga 1-6 as being 'blockbusters', but actually they are big budget independent movies, made by an experimental/documentary filmmaker/producer. The saga, with the exception of Kershner's ESB is shot largely as a documentary, and the story is told through R2 - who was of course sidelined in the sequels in order to have the charmless BB8, an imitator of R2, so JJ's 'Bad Robot' production company would pay less royalties to Lucas for the merch profits, and take a bigger slice for themselves. And in Rise of Skywalker, they gave BB8 its own BB8 style pet in the form of the D-O droid, for good measure. Utter nonsense.",0.91073668,C,positive

When you see at The Mandalorian or The Book of Boba Fett you can see that there's no bottom below. No depth. They just exist for the seek of existing. Baby Yoda is popular not because it does anything (it doesn't do anything at all) but because it's cute and it's live action.

"Can someone help an amateur to understand the state of the universe that Prof. Susskind describes around 40:30?_
He explains that at the cosmic horizon, there will be quantum energy (fluctuating particles). It's not clear if this is true before all matter passes through the horizon, but nevertheless, the cosmic horizon is described as the distance form a ""fixed point"" (the sun) to an object moving with the speed of light. My ""questions"" are therefore:

Would this not be true for ANY point in space? Depending of what object you would choose as fixed.
And as a result the sun (or the earth) would be at a cosmic horizon? Actually, any point in space would at a cosmic horizon. Is this messurable?

To Illustrate, in the slide showing Hubble's Law (38:40) if you put a planet / star anywhere on a circle 2x the distance of the cosmic horizon from the sun, that would put the sun in that planet / star__ cosmic horizon.",0.39282113,C,neutrally negative

"I went through interrogation school at Quantico as a Marine scout sniper. The instructors were both Marines and FBI agents.  The most important takeaway was that people lie the way they breathe; naturally.  We have been lying since we were children in order to escape punishment.  We are all good at it.  To get to the truth the interrogator needs to remove blame and punishment.  As soon as the person being interrogated believes they are in a safe environment they begin to relax, and their relaxation is palpable.  The effective interrogator constructs an environment of safety.  When a person feels safe their lies become much more apparent because of their relationship with the interrogator.",0.92298251,C,positive

"I don't think aggression can be used as a sure-fire way to detect lying. It's infuriating and scary to be accused of something you didn't do especially if it's something serious and you might get put away for someone else's crime. Not to mention people who have grown up in situations where they were frequently blamed for things they didn't do, they would naturally be way more aggressive cus they're sick of being the guilty one. 

I used to go to a babysitters after school and there were a few of us. One of the girls was several years younger than the rest and if she cried for any reason or seemed upset, us older kids would often get questioned why she was upset. And the babysitter's tone would usually already indicate she wanted to know WHAT we did vs. if we did anything in the first place. We weren't bullies and didn't pick on her, so it got pretty grating and upsetting.

I remember one time we were all just watching TV and the younger girl got up and left the room. A few minutes later we heard the babysitter calling us asking why she was crying and we were just baffled. It wasn't even like we'd been playing with toys and unintentionally left her out or took a toy she wanted without realizing. Still have no idea why she had been crying. 

Similar situations from my former home life along with this example from growing up have caused me to often become very defensive and explanatory when being falsely accused since I've often had to defend myself in the past to people who had already pretty much assumed I was guilty of something. 

You get sick of being accused or confronted for things you haven't done so often,  so any following accusation from anyone is already meeting with an already short fuse and little patience for yet another false claim.",0.24329203,C,neutrally negative

"As someone with a background in body language analysis, non-verbal communication, psychology and all the stuff Susan is discussing here, I am pretty shocked.  If she is in a position to train the CIA and CEOs, it__ worrying.

About 25 minutes in, she has not even mentioned the most important aspect in this type of analysis, which is establishing a baseline.  She fails to touch on individual baselines which is 100% necessary to understand before any analysis can be considered effective.  On top of this, Susan suggests certain behaviour is proof of deception/truthfulness which is wrong.  Body language and behaviour analysis is not a strict set of laws and concrete facts, but instead a science and art that requires a blend of analysis, interpretation, and psychology only to establish likelihood instead of fact.  Nothing can prove deception, only suggest a raised possibility of deception from a psychological standpoint.  To suggest it is 100% effective is  itself, deceptive.

Susan also states so baseless claims.  One she seems to be hind of is that in the first 5 seconds, a liar will show clusters of behaviour which prove deception.  As I stated nothing is 100%.  But despite that, there is no 5 second rule that she seems to be hyper-focused on.  People can display single or clusters of deception (outside of their baseline) at different times at different rates of occurrence.  A deceptive person can lie to you and show no psychological clues for much longer than 5 seconds.  It all depends on the individual__ personality, the stakes, the questions being asked and who is asking, the social atmosphere, the current emotional state of the one being questioned, among a boatload of other variables.  

I understand the need to simplify complexity so that is digestible for a general audience in a short presentation, but she overlooked very essential components of this science while discussing less relevant details.

This is the kind of like 'classic' story about what it means to be a transwoman.

"Interesting video and I would like to say thank you for having  these kind of conversations, there aren't enough on the internet right now.

I don't understand however the idea that 'autogynephilia' is wrong or false. As someone who experiences, to the fullest extent of my sexuality (there is nothing else which stimulates me), completely asexual (anoloerotic) autogynephilia saying that it is ""wrong"" makes no sense to me. Saying that it does not describe you, absolutely fair enough, but just because it does not describe one person doesn't mean it doesn't describe another. If the intention of the statement was ""not all transgender people are autogynephilic"" then that makes more sense to me, as there are cleary some who aren't. 

The difference between me, and other autogynephilic people is that I have managed to retain a lot of self appreciation and contentment in being male outside of a sexual context. If you over indulge in porn or act as female too much outside of a sexual context it will cause you gender dysphoria (which I have experienced a large amount of in my life time). Naturally, gender dysphoria is absolutely gonna be the main driving force behind transgenderism. The point Blanchard is trying to make (in my opinion) is that many people who become transgender are doing so due to gender dysphoria brought on by autogynephilic actions. 

I don't know why people dislike the term autogynephilia. I am happy to embrace it, it's who I am and I am not harming anyone being so. If you claim that it is ""invalidating"" or ""used as an insult"" then that is your own personal issue, please do not try to take away the word from people who are comfortable in their own mind by telling people who cannot possibly relate that science is lying to them, it's not ""wrong"" for a lot of us.",0.85562873,C,positive

"""Chemical depression""

That's american scientific reductionism in action right there. Saying depression is chemical equals to mistaking an identity for a cause. Any mental state, any mood or feeling or thought has a biochemical substrate, and is ""made"" of chemistry. But ""chemical depression"" implies the causal chain that gives rise to the mood pattern is entirely chemical, which is a ridiculous thing to believe, and much more ridiculous to subscribe to as an entire culture. A purely biological etiology for depression is extremely rare, mostly just endocrine dysfunctions or brain damage. All the rest is the eternal and unescapable two-way dance of genes and environment.

However this silly belief helps us accept that, since depression is chemical, the cure must be chemical as well. A cure which we incidentally monetize en masse. Also it keeps us from questioning what in our culture, way of life and material conditions contributes to the epidemic.",0.63818467,C,neutrally positive

"She is absolutely not a realistic and relatable strong female character for several reasons.

1. During her derby race as a kid, she really did need to slow down on the turns. But because she was immature, she ended up nearly break in her neck from bad judgement. Her dad, who not only let her race but also most likely helped her practice, yelled at her for good reason. ""You don't belong out there!"" Translation: ""If you are going to be reckless, you don't need to be doing this.""

2. The group of men mocking her on the obstacle course are heckling her to motivate her. Has no one seen a military movie before? Has no one hung out with a group of men before? EVERYBODY gets heckled and mocked in training, because it's character building. Tough Love. If she was so immature and self-victimizing to realize that she was not the only person being verbally harrassed, she doesn't belong in the military.

3. The message of her being ""too emotional"" is a jab at women being more empathetic and verbally high context. She is not emotional! She is overly sensitive and incapable of taking criticism. That's not emotionality!

4. I have had far more criticism and bullying from other women growing up. I could count on one hand how many times I was bullied by a man on one hand. Half of them were just off color jokes that went too far, and the others was one particular boy who was obnoxious.

5. She is sooooo arrogant! I cringe internally and externally any time she makes an executive decision. Legitimately, if she were a man acting that way, that character would still be a massive jerk. My best example isn't from this movie but in End Game when she tells Rocket from Gaurdians od the Galaxy, ""Earth isn't the only planet that needs help."" Oh, really, Cpt Meh-vel? You're going to to tell the person who has literally been traveling the universe helping different planets, too? This is why mansplaining ia not a thing.",0.0149775,C,negative

But he also has flaws and redeeming qualities that make him human and relatable. Captain Marvel is basically flawless (not a good thing) and has no redeeming qualities at all.",0.52786982,C,neutral
"After a second viewing of the movie. I think I found what made it fall flat for me. One of the first ""superheroes"" I liked was Goku in Dragon Ball and I'll never forget a line he says that speaks to his character and relationship with his power, ""Power responds to a need, not a desire."" With nearly every other Marvel character, we get to spend time with the character before they have power and see that they're responding to a need. It's a really important part of what gets you to bond with that character. With Tony we spend a fair amount of time seeing him in his playboy persona not caring about profiting off war. Until he gets captured in the desert, nearly dies, and watches someone he respected die in front of him because of the weapons trade he was feeding. He becomes Iron Man to balance the scales and take accountability for the part he's played. Steve was always small and frail, getting protected by others, particularly Bucky who Steve views as all the things he wants to be: Strong, selfless, a soldier. So when he gets the power to do so, we see him do just that because the military has become his family and they needed him.  

We don't get to see Cpt. Marvel powerless at all in this movie. We don't spend any time in those scenes they show snippets of that allude to that character development. Like, the scenes of her standing up every time she falls. Those would have been great scenes to show us! Maybe how her Dad never believed in her or she grew up in a town that always told her she couldnt do something because she was a girl. Maybe that's why being a pilot appealed to her,  the slogan ""Higher. Further. Faster."" could have been on a brochure she got in high school or she saw Cpt. Marvel on the news doing something amazing and she wanted to be just like her. Which would have made it even more impactful when she gets to meet and fly with her. We see none of flight school and her overcoming her challenges there...

The problem with superheroes is that you can't relate to them by nature of them being, well, super. The qualities that make them human and the experiences of their life that shapes and drives them are the real substance. They totally bypassed that substance in this movie and it's why it always felt like it's lacking substance. Like I've walked into a series on season 3 and these moments have no weight to me because I've missed the build-up.

"The filmmakers wanted to make Captain Marvel ""cool"" by having her be a cocky, super-competent hero who rarely loses, because she's just too cool -- it's like they saw Iron Man 1, and were like ""we want her to be cool like Tony Stark"", but absorbed NONE of the nuances of Stark's character, and just made Captain Marvel an asshole. Here's the difference -- Tony Stark is not JUST an asshole, at least not after the first act of Iron Man 1. He starts out as a real jerk, and he suffers for it. A team of American soldiers get blown and shot to pieces, he gets injured, and, in his attempt to escape, Yinsen is killed. Tony Stark's hubris is not a strength, it's a flaw -- it's why he realizes he needs to shut down those terrorists for good, since they were using his weapons. He shuts down the weapons division of Stark Industries. In Iron Man 2, he's still suffering from the mistakes he and his father made. His recklessness with his suit at the party results in Rhodey knocking him around, and then flying off with the Mark 2 because Tony can't be trusted with his own tech. In Iron Man 3, his arrogance results in Killian's forces blowing up his house, nearly killing Pepper and Maya Hansen.

Iron Man's ENTIRE story arc ends in Endgame, where he makes the ultimate non-selfish sacrifice in snapping away Thanos's army, killing himself in the process. Tony's arrogance may have been funny at times when it wasn't resulting in painful consequences for himself and others, but it was something that was seen as a real flaw.

PLANK, on the other hand, is just Iron Man 1 Tony, without any of the character development or deeper moral bedrock. Stark actually did care about the people around him, despite his arrogance -- Plank, however, shows absolutely zero human empathy. She gets a bit sad with her ""friend"", and is kinda sad about the poor, terrorized Skrulls, but overall, she just had zero empathy, and just walked around blasting shit.",0.1826708,C,negative

"For me this was one of the most interesting conversations i've ever seen on you tube.

I feel so blessed to hear Jonathan's careful and wise answers, but also so very grateful to see this process happening in the public square.    I know so many previously atheist sorts who are reconsidering what they thought they knew of God and of Jesus, and these kind of nuanced and careful conversations are speaking to what I think is a huge transformation taking place in our society.

I think of it like this:  our scientific ancestors rejected the version of Christianity they had inherited because it was not coherent with their new understanding of natural processes.   But now we, as their descendants, having experienced a secular world they couldn't have imagined, are realising that something of immense value was lost in that process and are beginning the process of reconciling the past with the present.

"He gives a lot of backstories and ways to verify everything he says.

"David Adair__ story is that he got to visit Area 51 (on a black jet, of course) and saw a gigantic alien rocket with a similar fusion engine.

"Hi David, I wanna share a special moment that happened in my life. When I was 17 years old I was living with my wife to be in an apartment. One morning just before we were about to go out I went to the hall, it was very dark and I witnessed three glowing humanoid forms of pure energy. They were very tall and thin with long arms and legs. I didn__ feel scared or even shocked. I was so overwhelmed with the awesome glowing power of pure energy they were formed off. I told them how beautiful they were and I turned my head to call my partner they vanished. What I witnessed helped me to understand that we exist in a multidimensional universe on multidimensional levels of conscious realities.I believe we are all souls having a human experience. The higher we raise our vibrational frequency keeps us feeling healthy and more energetic. Positive energy increases our awareness to connect on a higher spiritual level..",0.95892209,C,positive
