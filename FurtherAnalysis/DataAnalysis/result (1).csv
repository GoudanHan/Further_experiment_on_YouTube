I think history is completely different than we've been taught,0.8281943798065186,C
The wooden bird was created for those sailing the Nile to see the direction of the wind and the speed. It never soared over the desert. The ancient Egyptians relied heavily on the wind. I think that in itself is fascinating. Why do have to create these fantastical stories about ancient Egypt. The Egyptians were extremely practical people. Inventions with useful purposes in their day to day life were of much more value than toy birds that could fly. They probably wouldn‚Äôt have been concerned with trying to fly. They had a convenient natural highway called the Nile which they felt was sent by the Gods and made them special.,0.8406068086624146,C
The tall vertical tail meant that this bird was used as a wind vane to detect which direction the wind was coming from. They would have known from which direction sand storms were likely to come from and thus used this bird to detect such wind directions.,0.7550781965255737,C
"I think the wooden bird flies because it was modelled directly from ‚Ä¶ a bird, and birds actually do fly.  It‚Äôs the bird that has developed the secret power of flight over millennia, not humans. As for the weird carvings, if you look closely you can see they bump up against the hieroglyphs, especially note the standing bird glyph. Egyptians spaced everything according to strict rules, they never carved symbols that bumped into each other. I think those weird carvings are a lot more recent than we are led to believe here. This doesn‚Äôt negate the influence of higher evolved visitors at some time, or the Atlanteans (who may have begun an isolated mini-civilisation after a crash landing, and much later had to flee to Egypt, the Gobi Desert region‚Äînot desert then‚Äîand the Andes), but I don‚Äôt think this is the evidence for any of that.",0.8009108901023865,C
Also the aileron was ahead of the rudder. They made an exact reproduction of this aircraft and it flew easier than ours and landed very easy too.,0.8649182915687561,C
"For a civilization that had the ability to built the massive pyramids to such precision, using simple tools available at its time, they must have studied very in-depth about various scientific theories. I would not be surprised if some Egyptians managed to discover the concept of aerodynamics and wrote his findings down into the walls of the pyramids using the language of his time, hoping that some future smart people can decipher his works.",0.6728398203849792,C

"Book titled ""The Atlantis Blueprint"" by Rand Flem-Ath and Colin Wilson, explains it all. There was an advanced civilization on the Earth, and this book outlines many proofs stating that before a massive shift of Earth's ""crust""; which caused Great Flooding stories, the current Antarctic Continent was higher up and much  more habitable. It also was ""the hub"" for an advanced human civilization. The real mystery is how they have been able to suppress and ignore such a well written and exquisitely researched study by serious academically credentialed researchers!! I cringe after coming upon these shows on History, Discovery, ""Science"", etc. that continually talk about Atlantis being in the Caribbean, Atlantic or Mediterranean Seas/Oceans. At least they have not banned this book yet, but they sure like to ignore it. Also, they have ""closed off"" the entire Antarctic Continent to visitation or study, except for ""specially approved"" personnel!!",0.7276021242141724,C
"Truth. Without being rude or vituperative, I believe the cultures that found many of these tombs and ruins did not know how to give ancient people, especially with darker complexions and seemingly simpler lives, credit for advanced knowledge.

"00:05:03 she talks about finding ""9"". She theorizes this symbolizes Mars. There is another theory this may reference the 9 gods or 9 gods of creation.

"Just playing with all this in a mystic fashion‚Ä¶ a couple years ago, I wrote this- ‚ÄúWas thinking about the symbol of infinity yesterday and the thought occurred to me that we‚Äôre sitting in the intersection of this loop, one side our past the other our future, all looping back to the present where we sit.‚Äù
 
With this in mind, think of those who claim to see past lives, and also consider that in the etheric realm time is not linear, it‚Äôs occurring simultaneously! What if those who built the ancient world were able to see these future time lines?

"A good friend of mine from High School died preventing an incident that almost took out a vehicle full of Navy Seals.  Chief Petty Officer Jason Finan was the first casualty of the retaking of Mosul, Iraq on October 20th, 2016.  After spotting an IED he pulled his truck to prevent Seal Team 3 from driving through it.  He was one of those guys that disarms bombs.  Anyway, it wasn't the one he saw that got him.  That one turned out to be a decoy, the one that got him was hidden.  I can't even imagine what these guys go through but I can tell you not being an emotional person must help because the feelings I felt, as a citizen, thousands of miles away when I first heard the news were completely unexpected.  Reading about war, seeing it in the news and movies, none of it gets real until someone you know is killed over there.  I found myself thinking about the sick pathetic piece of shit who built that IED, similar to that fire you get when someone effs with one of your friends or family but quite a bit more.  I'm not an angry person, nor violent, yet I found myself day dreaming of pretty messed up shit happening to that guy....  And yet I am here, in the comfort of my home, thousands of miles away... While those guys are still out there, right now and these things are happening to their friends and family right before their eyes...  I can't even begin to imagine what it's like, nor do I want to.   And that is why I thank all of you who served for your service, even though you and I both know you don't do it for that.

"Very profound interview.  Kudos to Joe Rogan.  I found the decision Marcus made to re-engage in the combat world to be likely therapeutic. He says ""I had to"".  Whatever drove him to re-engage in Iraq I feel like probably saved his sanity and did not allow the horror he lived in Afghanistan to consume him.  Seems like maybe the re-engagement in Iraq allowed the Afghanistan experience to become somewhat of an experience along a bit of a continuum as opposed to an event that destroyed his ability to cope - at least for him.

"My mom had definitely contributed to me growing up that way, stuck as a teenager, but intelligent enough to keep money in order. I was down the same avenue described here, doting and all. I did try to spite her, I stopped talking to her for a long time. 

After watching and reading a lot of self-help studies and topics, and coming to a point in my life where I already thought it was over, I pulled myself back out of it with a completely changed perspective on how to handle people that aren't me, and how to properly handle myself. If I had to describe it, it feels like my dilapidated destroyed soul was rebuilt and reinforced with an iron brace. I used to always tell myself and believe I was lesser than the people around me, so I would sabotage my ability to socialize before even getting off the starting line. I started with more alternative and peaceful stuff, like sadhguru, then eventually moved onto Jordan Peterson. Though sadhguru may run around in circles sometimes, and his views are considerably different than Jordan Peterson in a lot of cases, listening to his words was the first step I needed to help me with the chaos in my mind and soul. I am still in the very early stages of this, this is all very new to me, and I hope this is permanent and I can stick with it, because I never want to return to my old life ever again.

"When I was about 14, I learned what trans was. One of my friends said she was trans, and hoped we could use ""he/him"" as her pronouns, and refer to her by a different name. I remember helping her finding a binder and looking up other resources for her.

I haven't seen her in a long time, but last time we hung out she preferred she/her and her original name.

Anyway, due to this, I was thinking a lot and googling a lot. I have never been a girly girl, and I never felt entirely right in my body. I thought a lot about transition at 18.

Once I became 18 I had already decided to not do it, went to therapy on my own accord and worked through these body issues. My body-issues stem mainly from my disabilities, and my lack of care for it at the time.

If I would have transitioned, I would have hated everything... my heart sinks so bad whenever I see these stories, especially the FtM ones, considering I am a woman, I can sort of feel the frustration and sadness these individuals might feel.

It sucks even more to know that they don't get much support, when they do in fact really need it. I cannot imagine being avoided for going through such a thing oh my god...",0.23403087258338928,R
The misogyny is def something I‚Äôve noticed in the trans world (not for everyone). But I‚Äôve seen it in male-to-female transitioners as well. I saw this one person we camped with become a delicate flower and would no longer help set up camp. That is a version of misogyny where the thought is that women are incompetent and they can escape work through being female.,0.7418898344039917,R
"Remember when it was cool to have ‚Äúgender neutral‚Äù toys and clothes and things not because of the trans issue, but because we wanted kids to be kids and not conform to gender stereotypes? Now we‚Äôre going backwards and people want to conform to gender stereotypes and feel it‚Äôs a sign to transition. We need to bring back the campaigns that told kids it was okay to be a boy that plays with dolls and a girl that plays sports and it‚Äôs okay to be different and weird and that it doesn‚Äôt make you less than. People are becoming increasingly uncomfortable in their skin and it‚Äôs resulting in unnecessary permanent/mostly permanent physical changes. It‚Äôs sad.",0.6958068609237671,R
"‚ÄúBeing a woman has nothing to do with femininity.‚Äù

YES. This is my question for people who are toying with transgenderism; what does it mean to be female/male? Just because you like girly things doesn‚Äôt make you a female.

"I wish you had actually watched the show instead of just the trial itself, because a lot of the issues you point out and questions you asked have would all be resolved and answered. While all the things you said are clearly correct, they are kinda the point of the trial in the show. 

Matt showing up late and becoming unreliable because of his vigilante-ing is a major point of conflict between him and his team. This tension, and the loss of this case actually causes them to shut down their law firm, and nearly totally destroys their longterm friendship. 

Their longshot defense strategies are only because Frank is pretty much indefensible. The only reason they took the case in the first place is because irregularities, or rather flat out lies, in the witness reports of Karen Page, when she talked with the court appointed public defender. Leading them to believe some foul play/tampering had taken place to ensure a conviction. They also learned that the DA wanted to extradite Castle to Delaware, where he could be given the death penalty. Come to find out the DA was planning on using this case as a springboard for her own agenda, and she didn't care about actual justice. Them putting Castle on the stand, they knew was a terrible idea, but they concluded they didn't really have a choice after the medical examiner's testimony was thrown out. And that decision led directly to them losing the case in dramatic fashion.

You pointed out that they hadn't even spoken with Frank before the trial. This is for 2 reasons. First, they took on the case 2 days before the trial, to attempt to help Frank because of the suspected tampering. And second, Frank refused to speak with Matt and Foggy, he would only speak to Karen, because he learned she broke into his home in her own personal, illegal investigation, a place where he hadn't even been since his family died. So they technically had communicated with Frank, just not directly, basically using Karen as a middle man.",0.2352190613746643,C

""a place where large numbers of people, especially political prisoners or members of persecuted minorities, are deliberately imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities, sometimes to provide forced labor or to await mass execution.""

The US 100% had concentration camps. However, 'death camp' is a subset of concentration camp which is what the Nazis had, the US did not. The issue is people just hear concentration camp and think 'death camp'. And neo nazis are able to play that association off of people using the term accurately to describe something else.

"I belong to a group of historical reenactors that covers all times and places from before 1600. Vikings are one of the most popular cultures in the group, and while most of us are into Vikings because Vikings are cool, there's a small percentage who are into Vikings because Vikings are, um, white.

Sometimes they're easy to deal with: They get kicked out of social media groups as soon as they reveal their true colors, vendors who sell racist merch are blacklisted, and non-racist craftspeople avoid using racist symbols in their work. (Not always easy because white supremacists are constantly co-opting new symbols, and because the runes are literally letters of the alphabet. The symbol on the neo-Nazi flag toward the end of this video is the letter O. If your character's name is Olaf, Ottar, or Oddny, better give up on monogramming your gear.)

And sometimes they're harder to deal with. If they have social capital and they're willing to fly under the radar most of the time, they can get into positions of power, or at least collect major awards despite the protests of most of the rest of the group. (Those awards are a massive help in rising to power.) The group as a whole trends liberal, but some regions are more conservative than others, and of course the culture wars have made it a badge of honor among some folks to ""stand up to bullying,"" even when the ""bullying"" amounts to ""Stop being a massive goddamned racist.""

So there are conversations to be had, and issues to be grappled with. The good news is we're having those conversations and grappling with those issues.

Makes me think that the UK has fallen over itself to make itself into a country that belongs equally to every single immigrant that chooses to come here for the life we offer. This multiculturalism has failed to the extent that, eg Muslims think the UK is theirs and have instituted Sharia law here with adherents rejecting our common law, etc. I suggest that what we need in order to sort this societal disintegration out is to make ourselves back into ENGLAND, according to our values, principles, common law,  traditions and norms. (Given that Scotland, Wales and NI seem to think they no longer belong to this kingdom). When migrants come here to reside, they need to take on those values, until they ARE English. If they don't want to, they move on. After all, at the family level, as each child arrives, whether naturally or by adoption, the family dynamic might adjust, but every child carries the family name. They live by the family standards; we don't become a different family or take on the characteristics of the abusive family from which an adopted child has fled.

By the end of the 80s, it was obvious to everyone that the East Germans, in large numbers, had become disillusioned with their ruling elite, who lived lives of extreme privilege in segregated communities (first in the Majakowskiring, then in Waldsiedlung) where they wanted for nothing, while the citizenry led lives of deprivation.  This was not unlike the apparatchiks in the Soviet Union and their luxury lifestyles, while the proletariat and intelligentsia struggled to survive on what was on offer after standing in lines for hours.

"I always had the distinct feeling as a Mathematics and Economics college student, that I was really just looking at cute mathematical formulas that were fairly simplistic and then someone made some wild assumptions about how the human brain functions individually and collectively to come to some crazy conclusions. But I just shup up, showed up for my tests, and patted myself on the back for managing to get a degree in a subject that is considered valuable to some degree. Of course in reality, I knew that I was in some pseudoscience mix of philosophy and sociology, but worse since it takes its shit so seriously and the math, simplistic though it is for anyone with a math backround, is just complicated enough to make people look smarter than they are. I gave up trying to understand this feeling or explain it besides concluding that it all is so complicated at some point but that surely a computer will be able to solve everything and factor in unexplained factors eventually. As I got older I realized for sure the human brain assumptions are so wildly off target for the reality of what I was seeing. This guy nails it on the head explaining so clearly why this feeling was happening for me and why it will always be there for anyone with a math backround and some level of critical thinking skills during an economics class, that has their brains functioning even slightly.

"Great video, there are a few points tat I kinda disagree on a bit.

1) 7:59 using castles to make the point that that the russians adopted mongol tactics to me feels to me to be a bit lacking, in that the nature of warfare in the large plains of Russia isn't conducive to building castles and that the usage of cavalry was key. A similar ish story can be told with the usage of cavalry by the Poles (Winged Hussar ftw) which also saw more cavalry and less castles and sieges compared to Western Europe. 

2) On the what-if of the Novgorod Republic - a bit of a disagreement on a conceptual basis in that would a state that developed from the Novgorod republic be ""Russia"" or an entity that we would agree that would take the form similar to that of Russia that we see today? This is very much speculation but would such a state expand into the form of Russia?

3) On the chinese system getting less corrupt as you go up - I don't think less corrupt is the correct term to use here, but more that the incentives of higher officials is very different to that at the provincial level, since at the higher levels their power are in a sense the power of the state, not the power of the individual alone and therefore have to in a sense play along to the rules of the state. Xi jinping cannot rule without the Party, he has control of it now but even the Party will outlive him. The same cannot be said of Putin and whatever structures he uses to maintain power.

On the whole, a lot of what I think made Russia is not just the nature of Mongol rule in Russia (which you also noted seems to be an exception to what Mongols did elsewhere, which was to assimilate), I kinda wonder what made that the case, almost as though Russia was the frontier lands for the Mongols and that characterised the nature of their rule there. And on some level I think the nature of the Russian geography itself drives the logic of how its systems adapt and develope",0.9290664792060852,C

Peter the Great had defective artillery manufacturers test-fire their own cannons, cutting down on corruption there (mostly cheap metal substitution). Everyone competent and useful was promoted, including former Ottoman slaves, like Pushkin's grandfather. The old empire might not have had a strong artisan base, but Peter imported the Volga Deutsch in the 18th century. Catherine later sponsored Euler. Various academies became very prestigious places, and a strong lift for social mobility.

In fact, it's this over-educated (in theories) upper-middle class that really led the Revolution. All the 19th and early 20th century literary classics (Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, Chekhov's plays) all point to an active society with many internal divisions and an active intellectual life.

"Hello, I am a scholar of Russian politics and history and I have to say: well done Kraut! I have to agree with most of this (I also see you have been reading A.N. Sakharov if you reached this conclusion :p). There are a couple of things I would like to add that you didn't mention (although I can understand why, trying to avoid super long videos and all).
1. One of the main things about the mongol invasion was the mass deurbanisation it resulted in. A lot of the economic structures of the Kievan Rus' were the same as the rest of Europe, but the destruction wrought led to a collapse of proto-capitalism in the Russian principalities. This is one of the reasons that the weight of the Rus' moved north-east: as peasants left the cities to settle in the virgin lands of the Finno-uralic peoples (who were mostly semi-nomadic). This lead to an economic recovery that was based in primary industries, as opposed to the post black death recovery which saw a growth in secondary industry. As such, Russia was stunlocked into an agrarianism it didn't break out of properly until WWII. 
2. The introduction of serfdom was, in part, a result of the migration to the north-east: as lords were scared of peasants moving to these virgin lands and thus removing their income (since they had no taxes from secondary industry, due to this kind of proto-deindustrialisation), they instituted serfdom. Sidenote but it is also worth mentioning that Russia had a system of debt slavery alongside serfdom: but this slavery was far more harsh, and allowed non-nobles to acquire labour, which was obviously a threat to the developing boyar class. So this slavery was outlawed but serfdom was universalised.
3. The princes themselves did actually have Veche (local assemblies) as Novgorod did, it was just that they were again a threat to their extractivist rule under the Mongols, so they explicitly used the Mongols to crush them. It wasn't just that the Princes were authoritarian to appease the Mongols, they used their ability to enforce state violence to crush the assemblies that in Europe would develop into parliaments. 
4. On the church, caesaropapism is a big thing but it is also worth mentioning that the power of the church was also destroyed by the Mongol invasion. They had wealth like the catholic church and were accruing political capital (especially since in the divided situation the Kievan states existed as, they were one of the few transnational institutions). The Mongols plundered and destroyed a lot of the wealth the church had, leading to its easy position of subjugation (which is ironic, because it had a lot of cultural capital at the time of Moscow overthrowing the mongol empire, as the one cultural unifier of all the Rus').
5. Finally, there was a point post-Mongols that a parliamentary system could have established itself in Russia. The Zemskiy Sobor during the Time of Troubles had immense power and crowned several Tsars. However it never used that power to give itself power by making the Tsar sign some form of Magna Carta or such, and accepted each time the Tsar wanted absolute authority to rule. To be frank this to this day still puzzles me, because even in the competitive system like what you describe a parliamentary system would have benefitted the Boyars of the Sobor. Still, their failure consigned Russia to the history it had.

"Very interesting video.  I've always figured that Putin's death would lead to a power vacuum that would be very destabilizing, maybe to the point of collapse.

"I was today years old when I found out that some historians portray the Mongols in a favorable light.....

They may have conquered the largest area of any army ever, but they did so at a tremendous human cost. Tens and dozens of millions of people from China to Persia to Russia to the Levant to Hungary were slaughtered in their insatiable thirst for plunder and tribute. They burned, destroyed and sacked possibly thousands of towns and cities, and enslaved and subjugated the people they conquered. Some places that they attacked took hundreds of years to recover, demographically and economically.

"The part about north-eastern principalities isn't true. Kiev started to lose its importance since the Rus became more and more fragmented and Kiev needed strong defences provided by a relatively centralized state to avoid nomad raids. + Kiev was the center of many feudal wars so it's people suffered from that too, especially the rural folk.  The climate was also getting warmer at the time which made settling in the north easier. And lastly, the trade routes also changed, so Kiev was gradually losing its status of a trade hub. There's much more to it than just ""Mongols came, Kiev ded"" because many cities were rebuilt and restored much of their previous glory, but not Kiev despite the fact that, if anything, it would've been safer after the invasion since Mongols wouldn't constantly attack and pillage their own tributaries. And yeah, the Russians build wooden fortresses long before the Mongols since the wood was just much more easily accessible",0.869158923625946,C
"I would like to point out that tethering this north-east migration solely to mongol invasion is a mistake. The migration started a century before the invasion. The reasons were compound: the feudal fragmentation and Cuman raids. The migration of power to north-east was pretty much cemented in 1169 by Mstislav Alexeevich the son of Vladimir-Suzdal principal sacking of Kiev and moving the de facto capital to Vladimir. Kiev still was treated as a de jure seat of the Great Knyaz, but most of them since that time didn't reside there and ruled Kiev by means of appointing vassals. Mongol invasion indeed is important, but don't make it as if it is the only thing. Especially concerning the emergence of north east. It was set to be long before.",0.8502416014671326,C
"It's weird you portray the Veche assembly as purely a good thing for its checks and balances, while ignoring the problems caused by the late Rus Princedoms prior to the mongol invasion. The decentralization of the Kievan Rus and the constant squabbling between city-state elites is often cited as one of the main reasons why the Rus was smashed by the mongols so easily. The height of the Veche's folly was shown during the life of Prince Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod when he was expelled from the city for being 'bad for business', only to be begged to return and defend the city after the Veche came to realize just how dangerous the baltic crusaders were.
Fact was that the power of the nobility needed to be taken down a notch, and while Ivan the 'Terrible' may have gone too far he was of the right direction. Had it not been for his centralization (continued by Peter's reforms in the Table of Ranks), Russia may have become as disasterously liberal as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, with its idiotic Golden Liberty and Liberum Veto leading to a century of utter stagnation.
If anything, Russian autocracy often lacked a true autocrat, hence why serfdom took so long to abolish -- multiple Tsars considered it only to shrink back due to the displeasure of the aristocracy. Could have used another Peter to go on a beard-chopping spree.",0.5375630855560303,C

"Hey there, let me bring mitigations on two points of this video :
1) People are getting richer
2) Capitalism had bring everything we have like magic

1) The notion of poverty is double : there is an ""absolute poverty"", which is how much we earn in general, and indeed this one is going back extremely fast, and there is a ""relative poverty"", which is the distance between people having most compared to people having less, and this one is going up. It is important to pinpoint that few people are owning the majority of the resources of the world (money, water etc), and that their part is increasing each year. So yes, overall, life conditions are increasing, but on the other side, they do not increase as fast as they may.

2) What first motivated the humanity to evolve was the need of surviving. Nothing about economic model. Capitalism and growth helped a lot to get the last push of it in industrial age. But another economic model would probably have done something equivalent. Now growth is getting us in a big ecological disaster for superficial consumerism (like we don't need smartphones to lives for example), so I wouldn't say ""just let the magic happen"", since now the magic happening is a curse.",0.12311145663261414,R

"This is only true to some degree. When new opportunities emerge to prosper from, AND they require sufficient labor to make use of, then yes, markets enrich the community. Unfortunately this ignores the primary way rich people get rich in the 21st century - stock manipulation. This has the exact opposite effect because in order to maximize stock prices, labor, wages, and benefits must be cut (not to mention input materials so the product quality drops as well, harming consumers too). So within publicly traded corporations, the rich get richer as the poor get poorer, but within start-ups and small businesses the opposite is usually true.

The rate at which poverty is declining in developing countries has to do with the introduction of modern capitalism, rather than the progression thereof like in developed nations. Going from being a poor sharecropper to having any industrial job is usually going to increase your wealth. But Western nations have seen the middle class decline, because workers are viewed as parasitic gnats on the ass of shareholder profits. I'm not saying socialism or communism is the answer (I'd prefer not to be reverted back to a poor farmer AND need to defend myself from a nefarious State, thanks) but capitalism can have different parameters than it currently does, and in fact used to anyway.

Btw, TV sets are cheaper in the US because they're made oversees by sweat-shop workers rather than by highly paid American manufacturing workers.

He is a genius no doubt, an eloquent articulated one, probably among the greatest minds out there, but it seems to me that he is so deep into the nitty gritty details that he can too easily miss the bigger picture and the logical gaps in his overall view, which Lennox tried time and again to make him notice without success, not to say that indeed his biblical understanding is very shallow, which is completely understandable it‚Äôs just sad that he present it with such confidence when he actually know so little about the actual text, which Lennox rightfully pointed to him as well.

"Wonderful program! Many thanks to the organizer, and especially to the two guests, who always stick with the truth. Can I add a point here?  Lots of Asian countries, including many regions of China, had an experience of falling victim to colonization. Therefore, China understands the painful and humiliating experience of a country being ruled by others. It is actually less likely for China to do the same thing as previous world powers did in the 19th century. As you can see, the Chinese policy of one belt one road also takes a more peaceful approach and try to provide contribution in developing the global economic system rather than becoming a threat to others. Also historically, when China had a chance to colonize many Asian countries in the 14th century (Song Dynasty), China didn't, proving that China has a different view on its power from certain other countries. Would it be possible that these facts are implicitly understood by all asian countries through the ""Asian glasses"" but not believed by US or non-Asian countries?",0.9273900985717773,R
"It is good to watch this debate again in October 2020, five months after it was first put onto YouTube. Facts tell that China and some of its neighbours, who are not communists, have done well in combating and controlling Covid-19, whereas the USA, much of South America and Europe have suffered and continue to suffer badly due to the Coronavirus. This reflects governance and leadership. In my opinion, Western politicians in general are good talkers but not good doers. They don't serve their people.  They serve themselves.  They have the ""me first"" attitude. This is totally opposite to many politicians in the East who have a different type of upbringing in a different culture and tradition.  Eastern politicians are generally more humble and reserved, they work more than they talk, and they serve their people.  It is also to do with the citizens in the East who are patriotic and obey the government in a pandemic.  They sacrifice the so-called ""human rights"", ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" that they West always champion about.
The UK is now in a mess going back to square one after wasting so many months of indecisive and inconsistent  approach in tackling the Coronavirus. People want freedom; yes they can spread the virus. People want democracy, yes, they can debate on the subject with opposing views. People want human rights, yes, they can break the newly imposed laws.
The situation in the USA is actually worse where many people believe Donald Trump's words that the virus is actually a hoax. In March when the Coronavirus got worse in the USA, people queued up round the block to buy guns to protect themselves.  What sort of society is it? A warmongering country such as the USA wants chaos in the world so that it can sell them arms, such as to country like Saudi Arabia, who is alleged to have a poor human rights record, but does the USA care? They only see the $ sign and Saudi Arabia is not seen as a threat.
Double standards abound in daily life and yet the West have the cheek to lecture other countries why they are not like them.

It's natural for China to rise and it's choice for US  whether try to stop their peaceful rise or cooperate with them and accept the new power without getting into conflicts.

"A problematic issue I see with John's argument in this interview is his stance on Taiwan/West relations vs Ukraine/West relations.

When discussing Ukraine, John believes the best way to have avoided the current crisis is for Ukraine to have either remained neutral or went pro-Russia since it's neighbors with Russia.

However, when discussing Taiwan, he believes it's best for Taiwan to side with the West, despite China being its neighbor.

I wonder why the stance is different. I'm guessing it's because John theorizes that Russia would have been OK if Ukraine was just economically friendly with West and not associated with NATO. This is also assuming Russia wouldn't have invaded Ukraine on the basis of the civil war in the east.

But what of Taiwan? Would China have been OK with Taiwan if it was only pro-West economically and didn't have a military relationship with the US?",0.7421214580535889,R

My observation is that we Asians are outnumbered in this debate hosted by a very close alliance of US. Professor John is reaching his decision with a very clear American way of marshalling the world in the Western way. Sadly this debate has not been fair to the Asian side without accepting the repetitive advice that Kishor asking the West to look at the situation from the Asian Point of View.  Nobody wants a war even if they think a friendly Giant has grown in their neighbourhood.  The American has been hostile to show the military might in a foreign region Which IT has Not Understood fully.,0.42100977897644043,R
"The key here is the interpretation of 'domination' - I agree with John that China will have its Monroe doctrine regarding SE Asia, or becoming the dominate power in Asia. But does it bring a war in the region? I highly doubt that - if the US can act reasonably in China's view. If US deviates too much from rationality, a war is surely possible. However, I do think this is a very unlikely.",0.7034863829612732,R

"Jimmy Carter describes America as ‚Äúthe most warlike nation in the history of the world... China has not wasted a single penny on war, and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre ahead of us in almost every way.‚Äù

Carter then said the U.S. has been at peace for only 16 of its 242 years as a nation. Counting wars, military attacks and military occupations, there have actually only been five years of peace in US history. 

China‚Äôs peace dividend has allowed and enhanced its economic growth, Carter said. ‚ÄúHow many miles of high-speed railroad do we have in this country?‚Äù he asked. China has around 18,000 miles (29,000 km) of high speed rail lines while the US has ‚Äúwasted, I think, $3 trillion‚Äù on military spending. According to a November 2018 study by Brown University‚Äôs Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs, the US has spent $5.9 trillion waging war in Iraq,

""" Two years ago, NDP MP Jenny Kwan protested that the federal Liberals were directing less than one per cent of their social housing budget to B.C., despite the province being home to 11 per cent of the nation‚Äôs population.

The stark imbalance has improved since Kwan aired her complaints.

But the Vancouver East NDP MP says British Columbians, who struggle with some of the costliest housing on the continent and high homelessness rates, still do not receive their legitimate share of social-housing funds. The vast majority continues to go to vote-rich Ontario.

‚ÄúIt was shocking to learn that in January, 2020, B.C. was so severely shortchanged by the federal government for our fair share of social housing and shelter funding from the National Housing Strategy‚Äôs Co-Investment Fund, the only federal social housing program at the time,‚Äù Kwan said.

‚ÄúSince exposing that B.C. only got 0.5 per cent of the funding, I‚Äôm glad to report that more funds have begun to flow to B.C.‚Äù

Kwan, the NDP‚Äôs housing critic, is not alone in being appalled at the historically tiny level of non-profit housing money trickling in to B.C. The province‚Äôs former premier, Mike Harcourt, said last week the federal Liberals made a huge mistake in 1993 when they cancelled such housing programs.

Now non-profit housing is needed more than ever, including because of widespread B.C. homelessness and addiction, Harcourt said, adding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‚Äôs new record high immigration targets for Canada are also placing extra intense pressure on housing and prices.

Compared to the meagre 0.5 per cent of funds that B.C. received in the past for social housing, Kwan‚Äôs office provided government data showing the proportion of such money that went to the province, based on figures from early last year, bumped up to 5.7 per cent.

That amounted to $135 million in grants and loans to B.C. from the National Housing Strategy‚Äôs Co-Investment Fund, an arm of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

In the meantime, Kwan‚Äôs assistant provided figures showing Ontario was last year getting 86 per cent of the fund‚Äôs money, for a total of $1.3 billion. Alberta was worse off than B.C., drawing only 1.8 per cent.

When Kwan took into account additional Co-Investment Fund funding from Ottawa that has been ‚Äúcommitted,‚Äù meaning promised based on certain conditions that had to be fulfilled, she said the proportion potentially heading to B.C. last year jumped to 8.6 per cent of the total or $266 million. Ontario, with three times the population, was apportioned $2.4 billion.

‚ÄúWhile this is a marked improvement from 0.5 per cent,‚Äù Kwan said, ‚Äúit is still not enough. We still fall short on a per capita basis, which is 11 per cent.‚Äù

Although the federal Liberals in 2017 announced ‚Äúwith great fanfare‚Äù a new national housing strategy, including by declaring that ‚Äúadequate housing is a basic human right,‚Äù Kwan said the housing crisis is only getting worse.

While Harcourt praised Kwan for drawing attention to B.C.‚Äôs past shortfall, the one-time Vancouver mayor laments how former prime minister Jean Chretien‚Äôs decision to kill Ottawa‚Äôs non-profit housing program, which had been producing 25,000 lower-cost units a year (including many in Vancouver), resulted in 600,000 subsidized homes never being constructed.

‚ÄúNow the Liberals‚Äô increase of immigration levels from 250,000 to 400,000 newcomers per year means we need a massive catch-up and a well-funded federal housing program, partnered with provincial funding initiatives,‚Äù said Harcourt, noting 75 per cent of immigrants move to either Montreal, Toronto or Vancouver.

When Postmedia asked federal Housing Minister Ahmed Hussen whether he believes B.C. receives a fair portion of social-housing money, officials did not offer an opinion or release figures on finalized payments to B.C.

Instead, CMHC media relations officer Leonard Catling said the latest figures, from March, indicate $899 million has been promised based on certain condition that have yet to be fulfilled, to B.C. applicants through the Co-Investment Fund to build or repair 6,800 affordable homes. Out of a national fund of $5.3 billion, that‚Äôs works out to 16 per cent for B.C.

The federal government‚Äôs Place to Call Home website, Catling said, provides more information on how the federal government is providing additional funds to applicants from B.C. and elsewhere for such things as building rental housing and subsidizing the rents of ‚Äúmarginalized groups with low incomes.‚Äù

Jill Atkey, head of the B.C. Non-profit Housing Association, said she‚Äôs encouraged to see increased federal investment in affordable housing, including through the CMHC‚Äôs co-investment arm. ‚ÄúHowever, the rental affordability crisis is worse in B.C. than anywhere else in the country and investments need to match that need. We are not there yet.‚Äù

Since land prices are so high in B.C., especially in urban areas, Atkey said the amount of federal money going into building low-cost housing in the province does not go nearly as far as it would in other parts of the country.

For his part, Harcourt, who recently wrote a Vancouver Sun commentary arguing the city of Vancouver should increase density while avoiding ‚Äúoverdeveloping‚Äù certain neighbourhoods, praised the B.C. government‚Äôs pledge to work with the private sector to create about 11,000 affordable housing units a year.

Ottawa, he said, needs to be supporting the construction of 7,000 more non-profit units each year for the province.

The demand is urgent.""

Men he knew that had seen the worst fighting in the war were turning away their heads and some just fell upon the ground trying to emotionally and mentally cope with the horrors that they saw.  Everyone heard of the ""rumors"", but to see it first hand, my father said that it changed every one of his men, all of them.

To imply we know more than 2 million years of evolutionary history is simply insane and arrogance to the highest order. Humans may be smart but time has already proven what our natural diet is.

The father had his surname changed from Schicklgruber (his mother's name) to something resembling the family name of the suspected father (Adolf's grandfather), which was Hiedler.  Either intentionally or through drunken incompetence the parish official crossed out ""Schicklgruber"" and replaced it with ""Hitler"" (rather than ""Hiedler"" ).  Thus Adolf's father became known as Alois Hitler.  ""Hitler"" wasn't a known or used family name before this clerical intervention.  The subsequent Hitler family tree doesn't have any significant children who could have continued the name, many remained childless, or if female married into a different family name.

I was spit on, had books dropped on my head, pushed into lockers, pushed around in the gym locker room, picked last for every team, cut in the lunch line, had lunch trays stolen from me, had pencils and binders ripped out of my hands, and was generally treated like trash. I also didn't have a single friend, and I wasn't enrolled in any extracurricular activities. I never fought back, nor did I ever report any of the abuse. Apparently everyone could sense something in me that made them think, ""He's an easy target."" It wasn't until long after I graduated high school that my family learned of all this, and even then I was hesitant to tell them. This is where much of my current social anxiety and obsessive‚Äìcompulsiveness comes from. Speaking from experience, I can say with absolute certainty that ""not stooping to the bullies' level""‚Äîpacifism and nonviolence‚Äîdo not work. If you (or a young relative) are being bullied in school, you _must_ fight back. You cannot try to ignore the abuse; that just makes it worse. For your mental health's sake, you must fight back.

I've mastered the stare down. People think its a game of chicken or who looks meaner. Oh no. That's what gets you punched. Only someone who's never been in a fight acts like that. 

What really unnerves people is a calm demeanor of pure acceptance while looking in to their eyes like your looking though them. You cant shake. You cant show any emotion but pure acceptance for what is about to happen.

When I was 9 or 10 a kid in my was always pestering, challenging and bullying me, saying he'd beat me up, eat me even. He'd follow me home from school, yelling these things at me (from across the street).
So the first time I stood up to this was quit close to home. I turned to him and said: ""I'll just drop off my bag and I'll be back.""
When I came back, he was gone, much to my surprise. He had invested a lot of time and effort in bullying me and telling me he wanted to fight me, so I was surprised he didn't take this opportunity.
The second time, still relatively close to home, I just put my bag down behind me and said: ""Ok, come on then.""
Which made him scowl and shut up and walk away. And he never bothered me again.
An other time was in high school. where a guy kept pushing, pushing pushing (verbally) until I finally lashed out in anger (physically). Actually a very non-expert blow to his stomach. I always avoid fights (which is not necessarily a good character trait), so I have zero fighting skill. He never bothered me again either.
These bullies I've encountered are cowards. Perhaps they feel very insecure and have to put down others to feel better themselves.

"There was an incident a couple of decades ago in which a police officer in Australia, pulled over a couple on a state motorway. The man was an ex-con who started struggling with the officer at the roadside, fighting and biting him. The woman managed to get hold of the cop's baton and started hitting him as he fought with her boyfriend, then the boyfriend started trying to grab the cop's gun from his holster. The cop managed to win the struggle for the gun despite being bitten by the man and struck repeatedly with the baton by the woman. He shot the man literally point blank in the torso, killing him. The bullet passed clean through and hit and disabled the woman. By chance I was talking with some people at a social event some months after the story was in the news. A woman in the group had been a prison officer for a while. She said ""Oh yes, I knew the man who was killed. He was one of the inmates I had charge of at times. I knew it was him the second I read that story because he always was a biter."" A few years later, my vehicle broke down on the same motorway and I happened to roll to a halt about 100 metres ahead of a cop doing a traffic stop. About 15 minutes later he'd finished the stop and he drove up and pulled in near me to ask what was wrong. I explained I'd broken down and had already called the breakdown service. Then I saw his badge and recognised his name from the news stories. I said ""Hey, you're the guy who had the fight with the biter."" He sort of stiffened and said ""What of it?"" I replied ""Nothing. Just good work, man."" and told him I was glad he carried on being a cop, then I changed the subject because I could tell he was uncomfortable with it. Nice guy.

"""Come and See"" is the movie that made me realise how pathetically lethargic Hollywood and the entire western audience is at classifying ""anti-war movies"". It is a real psychological horror and depicts the feeling of loss and being victims of war in overly realistic manner.
In Europe, from Das Boot to the latest ""Downfall"" (Der Untergang) war is boring, but suddenly can be tense, and overall scary, somebody will end up dead, and it is not as glorious as Hollywood made it to be. Even when seen from Hitler's perspective, a Soviet shell landing near your bunker is not accompanied by epic war music like Hollywood films. You'll hear deafening explosion, broken glasses, people thrown into the floor, and then random screams, crumbling wall and ceiling, then angry rants, it is chaotic, not epic. It is emotionally exhausting. Malena shows how war torn the civilian population suffered throughout this ""boring"" perspective.
Steven Spielberg calls ""Every war movie, good or bad, is an anti-war movie"" - which is pretty cute, given how I become a military junkie after watching Saving Private Ryan. It gave birth to Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Company of Heroes, Call of Duty series, it practically jumpstarted the entire FPS genre. Yeah, it shows bloody and gory Omaha beach landing, but that's it, the rest of it are ""cool"" it talks about ""honour"" ""sacrifice"" and ""valour"" - not horrors like somebody losing his limb and have his guts spilled out while crying for his mama. I never even imagined ""Appocalypse Now"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" to be anything as anti-war, rather than making Ride of the Valkyries to be a cool helicopter music and hazing ritual looked badass.

"We had a cheaper car (whose make shall remain nameless) that my husband bought *new* 
 as a very hard working young man...
It was horrible. 
The minute the lemon law period expired, it fell apart like a wet cardboard box.

Among other more serious things, all the interior handles (little plastic hoops) broke off within five years. When we went to the junk yard with family to find replacements, they were stripped out of every similar make/model we could find! So you just had to unroll your windows and lift the outside handle or wait for help.
We had to go really fast during snow and rain storms...

One day while I was driving it on the highway, a strong gust of winter wind came and the latch let go...
BAM!!
The hood slammed up, obscuring my view except for a tiny triangle at the bottom, because it had wrenched itself off one of the hinges.
I managed to not die, and got home with the help of a very kind stranger who tied it down with strips of towel.
Husband and his father cut up wire coat hangers with tin snips and wired it down,
But after that the engine sounded SO loud because the hood didnt really close...
Plus, it looked like
 *chef's kiss* 
absolute trash.
We got pulled over for having an imaginary tail light out CONSTANTLY, I assume partly because cops thought we had just rammed something.

The utter kicker was when the built in car alarm started malfunctioning one morning.

Any time you drove forward, the alarm would sound... if you drove 25 to 35 mph it sounded normal. Faster than that, and it was sped up like Alvin and the Chipmunks,
 Below about 25 mph and it was slow, stretched out and distorted.

And because the hood was a wired down ruffled potato chip shape that didnt perfectly cover the engine where the alarm speaker sits
It was !!!!LOUD!!!

We had to drive it to the mechanic like that.

It was like being in the world's worst one float parade. We actually started waving at the bewildered, deeply concerned people who turned around, popped up,

I got in the water with him. I said, 'You get in the bath, right? You wash your face, right?' We got our faces wet. 
Next, we blew bubbles, putting our mouths in the water, making fart noises.

"I was once part of an apprenticeship that demanded survival of the fittest. They wanted to compete against many training programs in a market recovery move. The first few years were about what you would expect being the low guy on the ladder and handling all the lifting and grunt work even if you aren't an Olympian. After several years of training and into our final year we were given a hype speech and told these are the jobs few have the guts to do to and start acting like we had graduated and pushing back on anyone who would give us any shit on the job. It was time to dish back what was dished out because thin skin had no place on a job site. We were trained to face death every day. Not exactly what I was expecting when I signed up but all the training was supportive and encouraging up to that point. Yet the reaction of some others to your indestructible courage was anger. You would think it would earn you respect but that's not always the case. Some would be determined to break you. Those who were supposed to be leaders were more like competitors. I had my final injury while working that finally broke my body. My core collapsed and so did my legs and back. I went through years of feeling like I had a beating by the end of every day. Back breaking labor was just part of the risks. Maybe the most broken tools with the most difficult method isn't the challenge you should be accepting from the boss. Maybe you need to call out the bullshit when you get given broken tools with broken gear.  We were also trained we need to go home alive at the end of the day. You don't want to end up as broken as the poor supplies you were provided by a cheap employer who sees you as a temporary number. Right there I'm getting worked up about it again but part of it was getting put down to test your nerve. Labor disputes are still a thing today and likely always will be. There is a proper tool for the job. There is a proper approach to quality work. This courage and knowledge can be threatening to others though the right team would appreciate your tenacity. Like-ability is also as important as being aggressive. If you can manage both that's another skill. I've heard many talks about leadership and attitude so I humbly appreciate what the experienced have to say about it. I use that as fuel to overcome what facing fears can do to you or your body , mind and integrity while your down and recovering. Surviving something is a different kind of suck. It can alter you but try not to lose yourself in it. You had the guts to get things done.",0.8395277261734009,C

"As a librarian, I am beyond frustrated with the right's habit of complaining about ""indoctrination"" and then trying to impose their own kind of indoctrination. There is a huge issue right now with right-leaning groups going after libraries - especially school libraries, but also some public libraries. They are actively attempting to censor work and/or programming by and for Black and LGBTQIA+ communities (and also some ""left-leaning"" newspapers) while simultaneously complaining that public access to views unlike their own is indoctrination. Some proposed legislation even includes parental oversight boards and jail time for librarians who don't censor in accordance to these groups' wishes. Other legislation goes after funding to coerce libraries and librarians or puts oversight in the hands of other groups, like city councils or school boards. It is absolutely sickening. Most of the legislation hasn't gone through, thankfully, but a lot of school librarians are really under fire right now. Just because you don't want your kid to access some kinds of material doesn't mean that there aren't other people in the community who might benefit from that material! Somehow, providing access to a wide array of material and programming is ""indoctrination,"" but only providing access to right-leaning material and programming is not. It doesn't make sense.

People like this, who confuse mere access with ""indoctrination,"" fundamentally do not understand that everyone has a right to access information from a wide variety of sources and perspectives.

"something to consider about ""God given morality""

people always claim that God gave us our moral sense, although the Bible itself claims the exact opposite... we only gained moral sense by disobeying God, he never intended for us to have a moral sense at all...

but it gets far far worse than that...

we gained ""moral sense"" by eating the forbidden fruit, and yet,, we are told that our moral sense is still corrupt and false compared to God's

So, this forbidden fruit that gave us our morals, is literally the world's first case of false advertising, because it really wasn't ""the knowledge of good and evil"", it was faulty by design (or God is an idiot who cannot create a perfect forbidden fruit that actually works as advertised)

That is all to say nothing about the oddity that we often find things immoral when the ""perfect God"" seems to feel those things which make compassionate humans vomit, are actually moral (like slavery, genocide and rape)",0.13809208571910858,L

"0:45 And Douglas is correct. From years of business experience I'd have to say that the 'type' of person that goes into certain professions match the profession. So a woman who goes into that sort of aggressive banking environment is up for for the excitement and danger just as much as the men. My wife was watching a history documentary series on great leaders throughout time. She started with saying that all history was just a series of dick-measuring contests, until a few women leaders showed up, who behaved basically the same. Then she decided that it was the type of person that sought those roles that was the problem.",0.5987655520439148,C
"Male feminists have not received nearly enough cultural attention even though they are a very interesting species to observe.

I meant to bring it in for you. ' 
Then we have the White Knight ones who are always taking the floor to denounce the 'sexism' of other men in a room. They seem to be positioning themselves as ''very special men''. The irony of it is that they are engaging in a couple of stereotypical male behaviours , which are competing with other

"OMG- this 8 minute broadcast got so may thoughts going through my mind. I am, hopefully like many people, coming to the conclusion that (some) men who want to identify as women are just using it as another way to get to women.  Also I have to say that the past 60 years have been a waste of time. We have been promoting women's rights and equality, and in my view, women can do what they want right now.   They can be mothers,  they can have a career, they can be mothers and have career.   They don't have to have children as recent statistics have shown.   So WHY do women still allow themselves into hotel rooms with men they don't really know.  WHY do they allow themselves to be ruled by men, dominated by men and often ultimately,  abused by men.   WHY are they taken in by the shit men feed them.  I think we should all (men included) rewind and think again.",0.29252561926841736,C

I usually had 2-3 other pct's on the floor with me, but this pandemic has created such a major under staffing issue, that I was often left as the only PCT on the floor; that meant that I had to help tend to 30 patients (minimum) every single shift, which, for those unaware, is 12 hours per shift.

People were asked at the very least to wear a mask and to limit social gatherings, yet they failed to even do such easy tasks, while we were out here being over-worked, underpaid, and seeing our patients die such horrible deaths every single shift.

"My Aunt is a nurse who had to get the vaccine or she would have been terminated from her job so she really had no choice but to get the vaccine since she is a nurse for the elderly. Anyway, even with the vaccine she still got Covid. I will say though, she told me her symptoms were very mild and easily manageable, just to put things into perspective, she's almost 50 years old and use to smoke a lot of cigarettes in her younger years. She probably spent most of her 20's and 30's smoking cigarettes off-and-on. I personally haven't been vaccinated, not because of religious or political beliefs, but just because I've had covid before and being a 29 year old person without any history of smoking or breathing difficulties, covid for me, wasn't much less than a walk in the park, fortunately. My 87 year old grandfather got the vaccine as soon as the vaccine came out. My 87 year old grandfather came to visit me and my family during this past thanksgiving and we had a lot of friends over and we ended up catching Covid, my grandfather included. My wife and I had the night sweats/chills for one night, we had the feeling of unwellness for a few days, and we had the random persistent cough every now and then for a few days. We also lost our sense of taste and smell for about 2 months so far. As of right now, we probably only have about 50% of our sense of smell and taste back. My 87 year old grandfather who also got Covid from us, only lost his sense of smell and taste for a couple days if that. He said he felt like he had a common cold for few days and then was fine.

"I used to be one of those types of people, not trans specifically, but someone obsessed with subjective identity and a perceived need for it to be accepted by society. There was a period of great resentment for my own family for not ""accepting"" and more importantly conforming to my ideas. My step mother would be of the opinion that I should ""stop obsessing over it and live a life"". It eventually led to a massive blow out between myself and my father. We didn't speak for a year.

Funnily enough it was watching Jordan Peterson on LSD and a brief ego death that literally shocked me back into reality. It was both the most terrifying and most beneficial thing to ever happen to me. 

Since then ive completely let go of my search for labels, rekindled relationships with my family, and managed to hold down full time work for more than a year.

The problem is there is no where to go from here. Interest rates are rock bottom. Wages are rock bottom for what is necessary to live. The system can not continue as it has for 45 years. 

Consumption drives everything in a Capitalist economy. That is why we have trade deals. To increase consumption of American goods. We also need domestic consumption. Which requires business to pay higher wages and expect lower profits. This is against every companies interest in profit maximization. It is why Laissez Faire Capitalism is designed to self destruct. 

The closest times in our history we have gotten to Laissez Faire Capitalism we see disaster. The Italian Hall Disaster, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, the Minors Wars, and the Ford Massacre. If it wasn't for Labor fighting against Capital the country would not exist today. Unfortunately the History Channels, The Men Who Built  America does not address this.

There is a great article that paints a bleak picture of where we are right now in regards to debts, inflation and interest, which points out that we are at the zero sum area of interest and how interest rates + QE has contributed to economic disparity called ""Why the Rich Get Richer and Interest Rates Go Down"" By Servaas Storm in the Institute for New Economic Thinking (an Economist institute for progressive economists).

"I think going through most of the romantic routes actually has more value than just a simple parody. If one plays all the routes in the game, then one notices a common pattern. If one goes with Sakuya's route,  he will achieve his ultimate goal of defining himself by his own rules, but Ryouta will suffer still at the hands of Shuu. If one goes Kazuaki's route, he gets over the loss of his brother, but Sakuya still lives with facade of the noblebirdie, taking no time to develop himself. With every route it fufills only one bird's objective. Sakuya needs to find himself. Kazuaki needs to let go of his brother. Nageki needs to move on. But unless it's the case of Azami, only one of these can be satisfied. And as the player goes on different routes, the game still reminds them of what's going on. Ryouta still has to have several jobs. Sakuya still has the bitter rivalry with his brother. All these threads are never resolved with one playthrough.

It's only in the Hurtful storyline that almost all these threads are resolved. It might not be the most pleasant route, but it's the only one that resolved all their problems and goals. Is it the ideal way to solve them? No. Does it solve the most problems? Yes.

I think it might be making a commentary about how suffering is essential to life. Throughout most of the romantic storylines, it is never as brutal as the Hurtful storyline. They're the most ideal of the lines as far as conflict. Besides Shuu's, most of the birds get by without major psychological conflict. Only through the most painful route can the true happy ending be achieved. Just like in real life, sometimes the most peaceful route does not lead to the best results. Making the player understand this by making them play all the other routes makes sense if the game is teaching them that lesson. It doesn't work if one could skip to Hurtful Boyfriend immediately. In order to teach that lesson, it had to be this way.",0.9251664280891418,L
"So there are a few things I think might be interesting to point out. Your analysis was very good, and the meaning you took from the final arc was spot-on. However I would like to take a second to discuss why the first routes are so necessary as they are, even if they feel weak in narrative tone.

This game, throughout its entire existence, is a display of radical narratives. The first routes before the final one is meant for people to not take it seriously, and the rather 'cheap' looking visual novel style (done in the vein of Ren'py) just adds to the sense that this game shouldn't be taken seriously. 

This again leads to a radical not just in the story itself, but in the people who choose to experience the game. Those who didn't get through the game, who probably put it down or gave up, or possibly never tried it in the first place, versus those who have finished it and often love it. Of course there are exceptions to this. It was actually that radical difference of opinions from, ""It's a stupid game"" and ""Holy crap the game is amazing you need to play it"" that got me to play it, because I wanted to see why those who finished it love it so deeply.

Which goes back to people not taking the game seriously. I think that this is an important element to the game as a whole, because it lowers the expectation and guard of its players. The more people think that the game is just a ridiculous dating sim who's major difference is birds, the harder they get dropped into the heavy narrative elements of the game's final arc. The 'joke' routes like Okosan and Anhel (I think  I spelled that wrong) also help to dispel the ideas of anything too serious when compared to the routes like Ryouta and Kazuwaki (I'm butchering these names I know). So the game just gives you these narrative threads that seem all over the place, before slowly spiraling together to create a firm rope which slowly creates a noose around your neck. Grim.

The element of the birds themselves is also a radical. Considering how much we don't take birds seriously, and how utterly silly it sounds to have a 'bird dating game.'

Which then leads to the final arc, which has a narrative-rich and still heavily radical feel. As you said, the game is never really a 'dating sim' in my mind, that's the one thing I think could have been different, but at the same time not. Just the whole twist and dark rabbit hole the story goes into is one so wildly far from expectation when everything seemed so light and, at most, a little twisted (in Shuu's arc).

So that all is why I think that the story itself is so wildly successful. Dropping all the interesting narrative elements at the end gives the player that strong 'Oooh!' or 'Aha!' moment, and makes it hard (nigh impossible) to put the pieces together beforehand (which I feel would ruin some of the heavy impact of the game). It's overall a story that rewards the brave or the determined, and is a strong display of 'don't judge a book by its cover.' Or in this came, don't judge a game by its thumbnail.

Sorry, I know that's long.",0.6986110806465149,L

"I feel like Hatoful Boyfriend's structure of '90% light tangentially meaningful content + 10% big motivation dump' is both it's best strength and worst weakness. On one hand, the mood whiplash of having seemingly quirky, one-dimensional characters be substantially characterized near the end of their route (with some exceptions) really works to set the tone of the game and build empathy with the player (although you could definitely call it a cheap move for shock value, especially in Nageki's case). On the other hand, if you aren't actively interested in finishing it for the sake of seeing everything, then it's a very easy game to drop after a few routes, even with the light foreshadowing and worldbuilding. 

In other words I tried to look up video analyses of Hatoful Boyfriend after watching this and couldn't find a single one that talked about the game with the care and detail that yours did (or even bothered to respect it enough to try.)

"I want to share my perspective:
I could talk about this game for way too long, so I'll only focus on the main aspect I see.
Every single time space is mentioned in reality, it is either followed by scientific discovery or cosmic horror. Either it is cool but pragmatic stuff or full on nihilistic dread. But by combining it with the vital element of a  childish, friendly platformer, something else emerges, something new. No longer do you need to worry about lack of atmosphere, cold, extreme radiation, tiny piercing high-speed pebbles or BOILING BLOOD. You can just explore and enjoy it to your hearts content without any real danger. And suddenly space no longer is like the inside of a volcano or the deep sea, deadly and scary, but rather vast, quiet, mysterious and beautiful. Space Junk Galaxy being the prime example. It is almost like making peace with and befriending a former enemy. It is not an empty hell, it is nature.  It becomes its own special biome, like forests, deserts, mountains. The game even goes so far as to frame space not as a scary monster, but an innocent victim, tormented by Bowser's tyranny. A crying interstellar ecosystem. All those strange worlds are no longer real-life hazards, but friends in need. The universe becomes one giant family. A place where everyone is meant to be and to live peacefully with each other. After all, the ending and Mario/Luigi's final words before the credits did not come out of nowhere.

"Sept. 18th, 2020

This game came out when I was one year old, and I didn‚Äôt play it until about 2012. Even as a six year old, I loved the game just from the title screen. Seeing the vibrant colors and beautiful scenery and orchestrated music created this feeling of pure joy within me. I would play it and progress little by little every time I visited my grandpa‚Äôs house, and my heart rocketed out of my chest when I saw Super Mari Galaxy 2 at a store in 2017.

Seriously, your evidence for Islam is that a guy wasn't incompetent at his job? It didn't even occur to you the reason he got that job is because he had shown himself to be competent at it?

On top of that, did he even bother checking whether that claim was made _before_ those battles? Or did someone see the dude survived a lot of battles, then engineered a ""prophecy"" that already had been fulfilled?

Oh never mind, why did I even ask whether he checked something. When asked why he ignores all those failed prophecies, he just goes on whining about his one non-prophecy as if it could ever mean anything. ""He wanted to die in battle"" so f-ing what? He was whining about the fact that as the leader of an army it was his JOB to stay out of harms way, and he didn't like it. So he did his job well, even though he would've like to do something else? What a prophecy!!! Color me impressed /s

Wow, never mind, never mind. The guy actually thinks it doesn't matter how many failed prophecies you have, as long as one comes true. He doesn't even realize that his means anyone could just make as many wild guesses as they want and of course there's bound to be one that happens to come true.

The Star-Spangled Banner

On the Shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes. What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep as it fitfully blows , half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam in full glory reflected now shines in the stream.

"I like Chomsky's explanation that within the variation of moral values, there has to be a fixed basis.  What is missed out in this discussion, however, is that moral values are based on the state of the society, they are simply rationalizations of rules that makes societies work.  Slavery was accepted because it was necessary at the time.  As society changed, it was no longer needed and it was abandoned.  However, the society changes faster than the moral values, in other worlds, the moral values are always a bit behind.  And when they catch up, then we have what Chomsky calls moral progress.  In the past 100 years, technology is making changes in society much faster than in the past, so this delay in the moral values is more pronounced than ever.  The ""fixed base"" that Chomsky is talking about is related to the fact that many of our biological functions have not and will not change, regardless of the technological change, and therefore that part does not change.  Not because its not relative, but simply because the rules are limited by our biological needs.",0.8354291319847107,L

"This whole thing completely misses the real objection to moral relativism: you can't jump from there being widespread disagreement to there being no correct answer. Chomsky here is just saying ""well the disagreement really isn't that wide, it's bounded"", but that's beside the point. There very well could be unlimited disagreement (there isn't, Chomsky's right about that, but we can suppose that there were), and that would say nothing at all about whether any of those many positions different people held, or some other position nobody holds, is the correct or incorrect one.

Agreement is not the same thing as truth, and disagreement (however wide or narrow) says absolutely nothing about whether or not there is a truth to the matter. The truth could be a position that nobody presently holds. Consider, for a different example, the true theory of physics that unites our quantum and relativistic models. Nobody knows what that is, and opinions on what it might be vary, within limits but still, they vary. But nobody with half a brain takes that to mean that there is no truth of the matter to be found.

"Although I wouldn't consider myself a moral relativist by any standard, I would hazard to make a few observations about the subject. It seems to me, considering moral relativism as a valid moral position has only two logical outcomes: Either, an individual must totally surrender his ability to criticize and evaluate another individual (or culture/ state‚Äôs) actions even while bearing witness to all sorts of atrocities and injustices or, he must become comfortable with an extreme form of what we have now; namely, the situation where institutions, influential intellectuals and academics, government bodies and ruling ideologues dictate absolute morality to individuals at the cost of personal freedom, social ostracization and state sanctioned punishment. The former is quite obviously abhorrent to all those who consider evil and heinous acts to be outside the realm of social acceptability. The latter exhibits a more creeping form of social control that manifests itself in the desire of individuals and institutions to route out those among the population who dissent from the prevailing view of morality or any other contentious subject up for debate. Basically, when discussing issues of morality devolves into policing people on campus and on social media and elsewhere; destroying people‚Äôs lives and careers over politically incorrect comments and doing something immoral to achieve a ‚Äòmoral‚Äù objective.

What Mr. Foucault focused a lot of intellectual energy on is finding out how power and knowledge interact with each other and how social institutions exert control over a populace with this power. There is no more important a subject to examine along this vein than examining how ruling institutions use competing concepts of morality to control different segments of the population, especially concerning pitting people against one another along racial or ethnic or gender lines, and across borders. It is pretty remarkable that Chomsky is able to flippantly shrug off Foucault‚Äôs belief that institutions and government bodies have significant power (‚Äúregimes of truth‚Äù) and exert major control over scientific (and admittedly by Chomsky, social-scientific) progress of the day. This should be a point that Chomsky automatically agrees with in full, keeping consistent with all of his criticism of U.S. domestic and foreign policy, and of course, related to his total and obvious adherence to (ironically enough) Foucault‚Äôs concept of governmentality. I think it is a virtual counter-truism that scientific progress and what is and what is not socially/ scientifically acceptable (they often go hand in hand) mirrors quite closely what past governments have allowed. I suspect Chomsky no longer feels this way now that he is the influential ideologue who gets to exert control over others‚Ä¶

In essence, I think Foucault is much more aware of how government and institutions, especially ones that purport to be ‚Äúneutral and independent of political power‚Äù like universities (paraphrasing from the actual Chomsky v Foucault debate) influence our perceptions of morality. Chomsky takes the position of not caring so much what trends have emerged over time and which people or institutions have affected the topic, only what can we define in absolute terms as what is moral. While I would lean more towards finding incorruptible principles of morality, I don't think anything on this earth is incorruptible.",0.9263796806335449,L

John Swan: ""I also unintentionally blurred the line between 'proof' and 'evidence' so I'll be sure to clarify that in the future.  Testimonies can be used as 'evidence' but they cannot always be used as 'proof,' as a criminal defence lawyer would argue admissibility and has a good chance of winning.""

"Good video.  Just as a note towards the end: the Baptist jokes are big in the South.  Having grown up in Alabama, I know a bunch of them.  Southern Baptists are the dominant group of Christians throughout much of the Deep South and they're responsible for a lot of our more obnoxious alcohol laws that are only just now getting repealed (it took a long time because of the Baptists).  Pretty much every Southerner knows at least one ""devout"" Southern Baptist who gets shit faced on a regular basis.  Hell, I'm Jewish but because I spent most of my life in Alabama, I find Baptist jokes funny.

Despite that, if you live in a place where there aren't many Baptists, the joke doesn't land.  For instance, I was born in Wisconsin and moved back there in my early 20s.  They don't get the jokes.  Still, the irony of this conservative dude saying that Baptist joke is you could argue that Baptist jokes are, in a way, punching up.  Right wing Southern Baptists wield considerable political power in the South and cracking jokes about their hypocrisy is a way for non-Baptists to mock them.  In other words, the thing that makes Baptist jokes funny to non-Baptist Southerners is the very thing conservative ""comedians"" like that dude always fail to do.

"One problem not addressed in this video (or even mentioned): most shows AREN'T Hamilton. Most shows don't become massive overnight successes that stick around for YEARS with multiple worldwide tours, multiple casts, static locations, high quality recordings and an eventual online release. Most shows that actually happen in New York aren't even necessarily recorded before they leave it. A lot of shows take their shot, play for a few months, then quietly disappear with only a few locals or die hard fans having seen them because the newspapers and online articles and reviewers just don't have the time and money to talk about every tiny show popping up off mainstreet broadway that don't see success, regardless of quality. These shows don't become sleeper hits, they don't get massive fanbases, and unless a New Yorker promotes it online, no one ever even hears the name or plot. 
Some of these shows are stunning regardless. Even some shows that get minimal success or limited tours suffer financially and have absolutely no way in hell of ever returning or reviving. Whether because of interest, cost, expensive custom sets, public reception or just bad timing, the effort of the cast and crew is forgotten and the show is lost forever. The set isn't carefully preserved ""just in case"" someone cares in 20 years. it's just gone. And that's tragic.

If a musical gets a soundtrack, it should get a professional recording of the stage as well. I was born 20, 30 years after half my favorite musicals left the stage and they arent and weren't successful. There is no chance of me ever seeing Hunchback of Notre Dame or Pacific Overtures or the original cast of Cats. With Cats, there was a professional DVD, and I've bought it 3 times. I've shown it to friends, I had the VHS, I have used it to defend the show despite certain awful Rum Tum Tugger performances and the god awful ""film"" adaptation. But for the others, the best I'll ever get is a bootleg and a description from someone else who maybe saw it live. 
If the music is worth recording, if the show can afford to get a booth and save the songs with the original cast, they owe it to that cast, the actors, the creators and the fans to record the show. Make it's $20! Make it paid online access only! But I have disposable income and I can't afford to travel 3 hours to NYC for a show; there's no way I can do the same from Texas, or Germany, or with a disability (which theaters often completely disregard, both physical and comprehension ones) or with NYC being one of the most crowded, expensive, popular cities and travel destinations in America. 

If shows would LET me buy merch online, I would. If I could buy soundtracks and recordings I would. But I can't travel 30 years back in time to see a dead show who's creator is gone, or a show that only ever played in one single location for a few weeks before closing, or magically hear songs that weren't recorded. If a travelling edition is made I will STILL never see the custom beautiful set made for the original location that was torn down when they left and physically couldnt work in any other theater. Shows arent just ""song 1 then 2 then 3"". They're also sets, costuming, dance, acting, dialogue and so much more. But when Broadway wants to exclusively base itself around wealthy 50+ year old NYC patrons instead of the current majority of global fans, those being 15-30 somethings actively participating and supporting shows online and through social media and fandom culture, they're going to fail and disappoint. The most popular, successful shows in broadway history are being smashed by new records and shows over the last decade and it's ENTIRELY because of social media, fandoms and a new focus on shows that are relatable and meaningful and important to young people. Instead of mindless conservative entertainment, these shows challenge convention, bring up controversial themes like suicide and racusm and sexuality. They're not MADE for 50+ Republicans with a reserved seat at every theater in NYC, they're made for ANYONE living in modern times, struggling, looking for something to empathize with or relate to or that understands them.  And that is the only way Broadway will survive. The rich snobby patrons won't go away, but if only the shows THEY like succeed and the rest fail, if Broadway insists on excluding anyone in a 10 mile radius when 70% of NYC can't even afford a ticket and they LIVE there, they will eventually fail. 
Coronavirus shut down broadway for months. No productions, no shows, no practice, no audience. They could be making THOUSANDS of dollars off of online merch, live streams and recordings, but they just don't have them, so instead they're sitting around losing money doing nothing. And no one gains anything from it. Hamilton isn't being released by a theater company, it's coming from Disney.

"I want to share a few points on how musical bootlegs have many positive impacts on foreign viewers. 
I am from Taiwan and watch quite a lot of bootlegs from Chinese websites. And because of the absence of ""copyright"" in China. So well-edited HD quality videos can be still online.  Sometimes the editor team will even add a montage to introduce the actors in the beginning. 


1. Subtitle and translation (Chinese actually put credits of the translators on the video to appreciate their work) 
For non-English speakers, to be able to watch a broadway show with subtitles really make a better experience.
2. Very limited tours outside of non-Englishing countries.
3. Reference notes
The Chinese bootlegs usually will add references on the top of the video for context that is not too easy to understand in other cultures. So Chinese actually has a chance to learn more about American culture through these added references. 
4. A pleasant way to learn English.    
5. Being an escape for freedom
Chinese audiences can see political metaphor (ex. Wicked, les mis, Anastasia) through musicals without the government censoring. Be able to discover and discuss freedom of speech and especially on expressing gay and religious thought (basically book of Mormon) which is not legal in China


These bootlegs seen from foreigners is definitely helping Boardway since many of the long-lasting musical production are being viewed by foreign visitors. Also, it is a way to bridge the culture gap. It created a drive for people to visit new york and london for the ""real show"". It creates popularity for shows and the culture of musicals.    


It is really a pity that Boardway is not doing official recording for all musicals before they end. People outside of America are definitely willing to pay and see it online or even in a local movie theater. 


The last point I want to make is that. For most non-musical lovers, the only exposer for them to musicals are movie adaptations which are usually not good. These movies give musical a bad rap. Showing the stage on screen is a good way to give non-musical lovers a chance to feel the theater and definitely giving them more imagination and a better impression of musicals.",0.924943208694458,L

The road is super flat approaching the intersection. The way the houses (houses East of Bear Lake) are aligned in the distance makes the road 'appear' on US-89 to keep straight then curve to the right, following the contour of the houses. Thus appearing like a 4-way intersection. Also, Logan US-89 road heads EAST to Bear Lake. The sun rises in the East.

"We have one of these truck ramps installed  on the road above the town where I live.  It's called a Catch Net System.  Over the past 14 years, it has been used 7 times.  It works.  All of the truck drivers who were forced to use this ramp walked away without a scratch.  Five other drivers who lost their brakes and chose not to use the ramp all died. 

I do not know what the initial cost was to build the thing, but I do know that the cost to repair it and put it back in operation is approximately $13,000 per gate.  Which the truckers insurance company pays for.  The trucks that have used it, have went through between 3 and 7 gates, depending on there speed and how heavy the load was, before they came to a stop.

The time to repair the gates and have it back in operation again is about 30 minutes per gate.  The damage to the truck is minimal, usually  the front bumper is bent and the fiberglass hood is cracked and broken.  The small amount of damage to the truck is quite surprising.

To all those that say a gravel ramp would be a lot cheaper.  I agree, but in our case, we did not have  the option of putting in a gravel ramp.  The road runs down through a canyon with a 8% grade, a mountain on one side and a steep drop off on the other.",0.838577389717102,C

He enjoyed the power and control he had over inflicting pain on living beings and watching them suffer in fear for their lives before they died and that‚Äôs what he intended to do in his murder plot. The way Ethan killed his last victim, Justin Shilling, really highlights this. Justin and his friend were hiding together in the bathroom stall when Ethan came in to re-load (after already gunning down students in the hallway, firing a total of 30 shots, half of which were close range). Ethan noticed he wasn‚Äôt the only in the bathroom so he kicked down the stall door, ordered Justin to get on his knees and shot him in the head.

"I rather say Muslim-phobia if I mean to criticize bigotry against Muslim people. 
Since Islam is an ideology, and no ideology deserves to be spared from critical judgment.

Also 
I don't want to categorically dismiss the many very rational reasons people may have to fear a religion.  
Especially one which commands the penalty of death (and promises eternal torture after life) if they ever dare leave the religion.  
And death and damnation are the go-to doctrinal punishments for loads of other offenses,  from showing a drawing of the founder, to loving a partner of the wrong gender.  
I respect Muslim-raised people too much to enable the tools of oppression from the outside of a supremacist system of belief and laws.   I don't want to play into a manipulative highjacking of social justice rhetoric that's used to automatically invalidate the serious fears of apostates, queer and trans Muslims, women, and everyone else most under threat from Islamic oppression. 

Maybe non-Muslim Western liberal/feminist apologists for the religion they have no experience with would feel differently about branding all criticism of the Christianity as ""Christophobia.""
I know for me listening to Muslims AND EX-Muslims, especially from more Islamic controlled countries,  is what's helped me to get a clue.

"According to his sister, Paula, Adolf Hitler was beaten nearly daily as a child by his alcoholic stepfather, Alois.  On two occasions, Hitler was ""left for dead"" from these beatings, which sometimes ended in strangulation.  He sustained nerve damage from a mustard gas attack during WWI, which left him blind in a military hospital for three days.  He lost his platoon comrades during another attack, which he was lucky to survive, but which left him with ""survivor's guilt.""  Like other frontline soldiers, he was given methamphetamines by the German army--it helps soldiers need less sleep--which he apparently continued to use throughout his lifetime, and he also developed a cocaine habit.  (Cocaine was actually prescribed to him by one of his many weird doctors as a ""treatment"" for chronic daily headaches - a pressure in his head that left him ""unable to think,"" quite possibly related to his repressed anger.)  He was probably schizophrenic and almost certainly had Parkinson's Disease and was chronically sleep deprived.  Not that the guy was a saint, mind you, but he was quite traumatized and obviously THOROUGHLY CLINICALLY INSANE... unlike tens of millions of people who obeyed his orders.  

Now that's a narrative we don't hear too often.  Why?

I understand that people wanted someone ""different"" from the standard politician who comes with political baggage, years of wheeling and dealing, backed by corporate dollars, etc. I understand that. But I DON'T get how they could simply take the side of a man who is the antithesis of what he parades himself as - Trump isn't a Christian. He isn't pro-life. He isn't against big business either. 

He may not be a Washington DC insider, BUT he's been dealing with these kinds of people for years. They're in his circle of friends. He donated to their campaigns as a businessman and hosted them at his properties. Even as a sitting president he promoted policies that would benefit these people. On the other hand, Trump has stiffed ""the working man"" on countless occasions, including filing for bankruptcy in order to avoid paying banks, vendors and service providers. 

It seems to me that a section of the US population is so desperate for a change, that they were willing to latch on to whomever rose to the surface. It just so happened that that person was Trump, a master marketer (of himself) and manipulator (of others).",0.8633061051368713,C

The fact that 1984 shows us the power of this hierarchy, being able to dash and destroy and convert the protagonist from his rebellious ways of just wanting to feel human like us into abiding to every word the system says. 1984 isn't a story or a bash against Stalinism-it's a bash against every system of power wanting more power, and a prediction of our future of we let them control us too much, regardless of -isms or ideology.",0.9826518297195435,L

"From what I can tell, the ""Western Culture"" these people refer to, culminates in an idealized interpretation of post-World War II America and Britain. This ""culture"" then consists of every major western empire (i.e. England, Rome and Greece) viewed through a lense that blurs out anything that contradicts their beliefs. 

They see the 40s and 50s as the ideal, because whatever social issues were still being swept under the rug. As a result, they will inevitably point their finger at the 60's as the beginning of the decline- where civil rights and feminism figuratively slapped them in the face. 

Anything then, that suggests that the 40's and 50's weren't the ideal, by pointing out problems that existed in that era, and trying to solve them, are a symptom of this decline 

Some of the younger ones tend to use the 80s instead- again, a point between world conflicts, where everything was fine (so long as you were a white cis male heterosexual) - so again any changes that they're being asked to make, is an example of such decline.

Why do I have to dig deep into my traumas and analyze them in ways I‚Äôve never thought to before and come up with some kind of palatable explanation for you at the drop of a hat?

"""This man was my uncle. I'm not going to give any names, but for those of you who are concerned with how things turned out for him, not well. 

There's so much to address here. First let me say that he was being treated in this video with meds. Without the medication his mood ranged from complete delusion to catatonic. As for being gay, I don't think he had much of a sex drive at all. With or without meds. As for the idea that he was put here because he was gay by some unloving family, that's ridiculous. I don't have time to say all the things my family tried just to make his existence somewhat peaceful just for his own sake. My family had a couple of openly homosexual and lesbians in it even back in the sixties and with the exception of my mother's father no one gave a shit. 

My uncle suffered with meds and even more without. After forty some odd years, most of which he spent in institutions, he took his own life by way of drug overdose. 
By the way, the comment about the plot twist, he never had a piano was funny because he didn't. His seeming obsession with piano came and went as did obsessions with religion, especially the Catholic Church and government. As far as I know he couldn't play a lick.

 He was very ill at his best and a living shell at his worst. I hope that answers some questions because that's all I have to say on the matter. He's been gone since the late eighties and I really hope that other members of my family don't see this video, mostly because of the comments from people that somehow think they understand him better than the people who suffered with him.
 One last thing, I think people thought that he was talking about sitting or standing effeminately or something. No, he was talking about sitting or standing motionless for hours. Usually not even his facial expression would change but when it did it was usually related to something in his mind only. I really can't begin to tell you all how heartbreaking the whole thing was. He did seem intelligent and with meds he did remind me of a high functioning guy with autism I once met.""

"Some NOTES here

1. CONTROL THE FRAME WITH BODY LANGUAGE & TONE: If someone talk to you aggressively make sure you don‚Äôt respond to their emotional state. Stay cool, calm & Respond not rising to it. Which means you set the frame not other person
2. WHEN IN CONFRONTATION, ATTACK THE FRAME, NOT THE CONTENT: The less you focus on defending yourself the better your banter will become. Don‚Äôt try to win every critical exchange.
3. HAVE THE BELIEF THAT YOU ARE NOT THERE TO IMPRESS: If you are sells person or on a client facing role if you shift your mindset from I am selling this person or I work for this person to this person need me to partner with them. This means you will push back when needed, you will give better advice.
4. BECOME AN EXPERT AT FRAMING PEOPLE‚ÄôS OPTIONS: You don‚Äôt need to have total control just control the options and the person who controls the options controls the outcome
5. CREATE OPTIONS FOR YOURSELF: Believe & show that you can always get different path, client, job if someone closes the door for you.

They were just humble farmers in Romania who had fled from their German roots because of Hitler. I have seen the poor farm house my father grew up in as my grandparents took me there in 1981. My father was the blacksmith on their farm and though poor they had land, animals, farming equipment, and 2 sons to help out. That is until Stalin stole their land, their animals, and their home. They were thrown into his hard labour camps in Siberia while my father and my uncle managed to flee to Canada. My Dad ended up marrying into a wealthy family and somehow they managed to pay my grandparents' way out of Stalin's hands and they were freed to come to Canada. I learned much from my family history and did study the Bolshevik Revolution and the history of Russia very much. My grandparents were blessed to make it out alive.",0.8425662517547607,R

‚ÄúAnd how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more ‚Äì we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.‚Äù

"'Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains ... an uprooted small corner of evil.

Since then I have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world: They struggle with the evil inside a human being (inside every human being). It is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety, but it is possible to constrict it within each person.''

NO!?! Are you crazy? id piss my pants!"" Thats when it clicked for me, that girls are not this higher perfect beeing, there just like us guys, with there own insecurities aswell.

Because I would have this image that they are something greater than me and I would feel the need to be perfect in front of them and make them like me. ( prolly a need for validation lol) But as I got to know them better, it would make me look at them as another human being with their share of flaws and goodness and it would make me so much more comfortable around that person and put my mind at ease. And I would so much rather see them as an actual person with    all their flaws and good qualities together than see them as something superior and superficial.

"The primary objectives vary according to their biological compositions which express differently their selection processes. For males, they need to increase the chances of passing on their genetic material which statistically increases their chances of success when there are multiple viable mating options. Therefore traits are more common and not selectively narrowed. However, females select males based on orientations such as parental investment, kin selection, and resources allocation which are much more sophisticated processes to adapt. The best way to think about it is that females will choose males based on what they can empirically provide, whereas males select females based more on what they can pass down.",0.6097499132156372,R
"Males are rated and chosen based on the degree to which they can positively influence the 'Physical Environment' around them. Indicators of this in the human domain are appearance (health, hygiene, and charisma), physical size (height and strength), and available resources (money and assets). Being able to positively influence their environment means they can acquire food, housing, allies, and create general order and stability. These things grant safety and protection. Probably the most important aspect to achieve this is having resources. This is probably why there are so many stereotypes about women chasing men with money. Women want men who can create a safe environment and bring stability into her life. This is logical. Especially in times of extreme vulnerability like during pregnancy, and when there are young children present.

Women are rated and chosen based on the degree to which they can positively 'Influence and Add to the Social Environment.' Indicators of this in the human domain are Appearance (health, hygiene, and fitness) and caregiving (supportive, nurturing, peace-making and friendly). 'Adding to' the social environment is straightforward, able to have children. The burden to bear children has greatly influenced the shape of women's bodies over time and evolution has imbued men with a subconscious sense for what is suitable for childbearing. This is why the stereotypes about men only caring about looks persists. It's partly true.  Being able to positively influence the social environment means they are good at managing varied and complex social situations which maximize the safety and reputation of the family and social unit. Men want women who can bear children and who can bring peace into their life.

The most effective family units, in general, are those where a division of labor exists between the parents. Each party works to minimize the time the other must spend away from their primary role. If the father has a primary role for providing safety and stability, he must maximize his health markers and earnings potential. If the mother has a primary role of raising children and safeguarding the family's social wellbeing, she must maximize her health markers and home management abilities. 

Each role is determined by what they initially found attractive about the other. If the roles are reversed, that's okay. You would have a dynamic where the man was attracted to the woman for her ability to provide and the woman was attracted to him for his looks and skills in social navigation. I've personally never seen this. In modern times you usually see a woman working to provide while also being the primary caregiver in the home. Splitting one's energy between roles is probably very hard and probably why the rate of depression in women has been skyrocketing. Women are filling two roles. Humans did not evolve to do this.",0.9094523191452026,R

"Men is about variation. Women is about specific preference to those variations based on environment and resources. There's not only one way of successful mating strategy. At the end of the day, those variations must be preserved to retain women selectivity (unless we don't need sexual reproduction anymore). Today's ""alpha"" can be tomorrow's beta in different places. An alpha merely changes the definition of beta (women's preferred choice) and make itself the new beta standard.

The primacy of selectivity is the main difference between the sexes. It is primary in females and secondary in males. Other traits are tertiary objects of the selection.

This burden of selectivity can move based on the cost it takes for each sex to reproduce. In spiders, the females move the burden to the males, so that it costs the males to be cannibalized to reproduce and the females get nutrition from this, probably zeroing the cost. Thus the males might become more selective.",0.9231935143470764,R

"I think experience, knowing how to dress for the activity level, is the key. I mean, it dictates what you should wear imo. So you cannot say you should wear this for that temp, and that for that temp. It totally depends on how hard your body is working and thus, how much heat your body is creating. The most critical thing is to avoid sweat at all costs. Synthetics usually traps sweat near your skin and make you even colder after activity. I have worn only a thin woolen mesh baselayer and a thin uniform in 15- C when moving with a (very) heavy pack and kept a perfectly cosy body temp. When pausing in such a scenario, just temporaily pull on a heavy woolen sweather/pants. Then remove these when moving again. If on standstill or guard duty, pack on with heavy wool and tighten any air gaps, especially around the neck/head. Some of the major aortic arteries is placed very shallowly beneath your neck-skin and they suck the warmth out of you if not properly covered. A Polished military leather boots, with thin wool socks and wool soles is more durable than goretex shoes. As you said, do not pack on to many pairs of socks - it will freeze your feet solid. You want to create an air barrier, like house insulation - so make room in your boots.  Military-style boots could be used as ski boots as well, unlike civilian winter boots. Multi-purpouse is smart. I would not recommend any synthetics at all, only a thin raincoat/poncho for rainy weather and perhaps the upside of your headwear, to keep moistyre away from your hair. Synthetics like goretex and fleeces, burns when hit by even the smallest sparks or flame and tears yeasily when heavily used. In addition it is usually very noisy, not good for hunting or other stealthy work. The down jackets are indeed  warm, but will not be warm if wet. My recommendation is to just augment military/indigenous kit. Wear woolen / animal skin tunics. For example a wool bush shirt / boreal shirt.",0.8202534914016724,R

"Good overall presentation. 45 years ago I was a railroad brakeman working in the Fairbanks, Alaska, railyard. I used level 3 layers similar to what you described. My footwear back then was a bit different. Some guys wore air force""bunny boots"" and we're quite comfortable. The other option was Red Ball arctic golashes. Inside these zip-up rubber boots I had a 1/2"" thick wool felt foot pad. I put on wool socks inside of a wool felt shoe (built like an Oxford). A plastic bag over this let it slip in the boot easily. My feet stayed very comfortable like this. At the end of a shift I could expect to find frost on the inside of the bag. This was no big deal as the inner layers would dry out during time off and the rubber boots never got damp. Keeping a thick insulation between the (-60 to -70 F) ground and my feet was key to comfort.",0.9636996984481812,R
"Living in Alaska I have to disagree. You need a good, waterproof outerlayer type bib and jacket Klim is my favorite since they are tough outer shells and the cuffs are rubberized and do not climb the boots like you were having trouble with in this video. Then you can just adjust the base layers and use the vent system for active/inactive cycles. I have 4 pairs of baffin for different temperatures and they are great for a day trip out riding but the absolute best is NEOS overboots. They will keep a decent hiking boot warm in arctic conditions and they keep your feet dry even if very active. For head gear I use the carhart a202 fleece headwear with built in face guard and for colder times an up-downer like you used. Gloves I must get some beaver mittens like you but I do ok with the mittens i have. Most important in ""Level 3"" is NO EXPOSED SKIN!! Any exposed skin will result in frostbite.

The other was a long coat that included an inner wool coat, a nylon shell over top with a huge, fur lined hood. Again, you could wear the wool coat on its own, the outer nylon shell as a rainy day coat and then the 2 secured together as a winter coat. Hands down the warmest winter wear I ever owned.

"In 1964, the 1st thing I had to do after reporting to Army Basic Training was to take written tests.  At the time, I thought this was an IQ test, but recently learned that it's more of a Vocation Evaluation which is similar, yet different.  All the tests had time limits and were multiple guess. The average GI score is 100, and without knowing anything about ways of getting high scores, I scored 137. I was placed into typing school and was assigned clerk typist because I could read, write, and type 13 words/minute. In 1968, I was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and got to know a crew chief (I'll call Joe) who would answer my questions about the workings of various parts of the chopper. I perceived that Joe was smart and always had correct answers to my questions.
About a year later, I went to Italy and found that Joe and I were in the same unit. One day, Joe told me he wanted to apply for promotion to Aircraft Maintenance Warrant Officer, but he told me he had only scored 90 on his tests.  The minimum score to apply for Warrant Officer was 115, and Joe asked if I had any suggestions?  I told him that I had learned that the final score was the average of the Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Math scores.  I had also learned that only correct answers counted. I told Joe to find out what was the time limit for each test. I told Joe to start reading books on any subject he liked to improve his vocabulary and reading comprehension.  For the math test, I told Joe to do all of the easiest problems first and skip the difficult ones. If he got to the end of the test with time remaining, go back and work on the problems he had skipped.  When he had only a minute remaining, just mark everything remaining as ""C"".

It relies un natural understanding from silence, introspection and resillience to give up. From a healthy point of survival, creativity must be met with a certain hardship, or there was no friction releasing any energy for growth. Any lifeform just understands it's own intelligence and works out the hardships it will face in life, or die.

"This is thrilling and fascinating to me, Sir Roger. The confluence of All Mathematics and All Physics is so beautiful and allows us to go deeper into the Reality and Truth of our Universe. And We, most probably, will never find a total solution. But the Theoreticians can dovetail with the Engineers, Scientists, Explorers, Practical People, etc. We can look forward to a testing and interesting future based on your thinking and your Associates and Colleagues.

"I have a problem with one notion suggested here: that we can or should quantify the accuracy of mathematics itself by how well the equations we've so far come up with model observable reality. If an equation, say the ideal gas law, pV = nRT, imperfectly predicts the volume of an amout gas at some given pressure or temperature, that is because the mathematical model applied doesn't exactly reflect the physical facts, not because 2+2 is not exactly 4. The answer is to make a better model, not to somehow tweak arithmetical results. No physical discovery needs to call into question the axioms and theorems of maths, only their usefulness. 2+2 can remain 4, whether or not there's a world to apply that to.",0.3436375856399536,C

When he says that the math about a phenomenon is precise to some particular tolerance and beyond that you see mismatches, does he mean that the math and reality mismatch or that our observations of reality begin to mismatch at that precision?  In short, can these levels of precision really just be the precision of our ability to measure at this time?",0.7731391191482544,C

"In Iowa City (one of the few truly liberal places in Iowa), several high schools have offered a ""Bible as Literature"" elective for decades now, and it's actually taught correctly. My brother took it, and he's absolutely not religious. While the classes are taught from a religion neutral perspective, if anything it made my brother more aware of the ridiculousness contained in that book. That said, the courses in those schools focus on teaching some of the more common biblical stories as allegory - the stories we frequently see reference to in daily American culture (movies, novels, TV, etc). Many kids who aren't raised in religious homes don't have prior knowledge of those stories, and appreciate learning about them *as literature.*

I have no problem with the bible being taught in classes like that. What they want to do in Oklahoma, however, seems much more religiously affiliated, and definitely *not* okay to have in a public school system. That's sheer craziness.",0.2731664180755615,C

"When I went to high school (way back in the Stone Age) I took an elective comparative religions course. It was taught by a certified teacher and was a very good overview of several world religions. No Bibles were required in class. No one taught that any one religion was The Truth‚Ñ¢. Purely an academic look at different religions. I learned a lot from it. I think those sorts of classes can be useful in our multicultural world.

That aside, I can see where members of other Christian denominations might be a little upset at a preacher from another church teaching their kids. Especially Catholics and Orthodox.",0.8779499530792236,C
"That's OK, as long as they teach it as literature, and include the Quran, the sayings of the Bhudda, Confucius and the Rig Veda, and the legends of the Aborigines, Maoris and Pacific Islanders.

"We actually looked at the Bible, Karan, and other religious and myth writings to compare the styles and influence they had on story telling throughout the history of human kind. Our literature teacher wasn't religious, that I knew of but a lot of the students were and for the first time they had discussions about text, they never really read, outside their churches. It went very well. This was in Indiana.",0.9300232529640198,C

"I question teaching the bible as a moral textbook or even as literature in public school, at least in the elementary grades: the OT is incredibly violent as is the book of the Revelation, and the morals it teaches aren't what I would want my own children learning. As literature in high school and beyond, fine.

"In middle school, there was a kid named Johnathan. I'm not sure what developmental illness he had, but he required adult supervision at all times. He was very small, his eyes were narrow and he wore glasses, he talked very loudly, his personal hygiene was poor, and he drooled. Because of that, people tried to avoid him. He couldn't understand why, so he would try to touch other students. Usually they would recoil in disgust, and eventually, it turned into a game called ""the Johnny touch."" The objective was, if he touched you, now you had to spread it to someone else and ""infect"" them. Once, I was sitting across from him in Science class. He was talking to me and I was trying so hard to ignore him. He put his notebook down and stared at me, and reached out to touch my hand. I was so shocked when he touched me that I almost fell out of my chair. I was horrified. Now, I'm horrified at how cruel I was.

"Also, you‚Äôll notice that the poem at the beginning of Genesis shows a clear pattern of being poetic because days 1-3 are mirrored in 4-6. The Earth is said to be without structure and empty.

The next four days we get ‚Äúlights‚Äù to fill the (role of providing) light, though they are described as being within the firmament or as a decoration on the dome itself consistent with astrology. They still fill the emptiness of something given order and structure according to the poem. Day five is concerned with life that inhabits the air and the water as that‚Äôs what the poem said was separated on day two.

That is what decolonizing means to them.  I posit that if someone want to decolonize themselves from Western thought and civilization, they should have the freedom to do so as long as it includes the rejection of ALL Western benefits.  You cannot call for decolonization and pick and choose what you want to accept as OKAY Western thought & civilization.  One cannot call for decolonization of education and then pursue a post doctoral degree in a subject.  The pursuit of a degree in and of itself is Western, thus it must be excluded as not an option for someone who is decolonized.  Likewise, if you call for decolonizing Western medicine and health practices, then having healthcare is part and parcel of that Westernization.

"A brilliant lecture! I had a relevation! I have always had a natural inclination towards dialogue the way Jordan explains here. However, due childhood conditioning (dysfunctional family/ interaction), I am very often ¬¥trapped` in kind of relationships and ¬¥dialogues` (originates from my mother and siblings) in which I am never heard,  and the other person insists on not listening (in an attempt to not to see the fault in their structure/narcissism) to what I have to say. They rudely interrupt me and do not let me speak. I am well spoken but I have realized that I have deeply intergrated pattern of being used to being NOT listened to and being not heard.  I have realized it stems from my childhood. I see how my mother is and how my siblings are. In truth, I am seeing how I gravitate to this kind of dysfunctional ¬¥relationships` and I have understood how this stems from my childhood conditioning. So, this pattern has kept me not going forward either. I have now understood that I need to change this and gravitate towards relationships (=interaction) in which people listen to me. Only then I can get to build up my inner confidence to speak up as a whole, intergrated person. As it is now, I can speak up as a knowledgeable intellectual, but as a whole person, in real relationships, I am quiet and I step aside, do not take up my space and do not expect to be listened to. I do not know through my relationships who I truly am, an an intergrated whole person. It¬¥s time to get learning! A great lecture! Thank you. This helped me to get conscious of my problem.

I'm not exaggerating when I say on my third day I felt better than I have since before my brain injury! I was up doing things I drove my car to the store by myself for the first time and over a year on day 3! This is huge for me. I look forward to what things are going to be available for people in the future. I can't believe that this has been kept from people with PTSD and depression for so long!

Today, every other scientific field has an endless variety of starter kits or other means to give children the same hands-on experience, but attempt to put together a small but decent lab and you'll get a visit from the feds.

It's crazy there, a huge open air drug market and people shooting up in public, and now the dealers are killing each other over turf, but on the other hand, we don't have the problems downtown and in other tourist areas like Seattle does. We're lucky we have a harsh winter, because things get worse and worse over the summer and fall, but once it starts snowing and gets really cold, people moved on, and the city tore down all the tent cities.

"This documentary came out while I was still living in Seattle. I lived there from 2012 till March 2022, I sold my house and moved to Pennsylvania only a month ago. I loved living in Seattle when I first moved there after being discharged from  Army service on Fort Lewis. The business's we're flourishing and the city itself was beautiful. I would take runs around Greenlake park even when it was dark. Going to shows at night and getting coffee or brunch with friends.
But over the time I lived there I watch the city just decay. The parks are full of tents and drug addicts, coffee and brunch became a little more difficult to afford and was often accompanied by a sad landscape of even more homelessness and drug abuse.
Crime became so bad that my car got broken into 4 times in less than 9 months. The police would just tell me to make a report online, they wouldn't even take the time to document the scene because property crime is a constant problem.
People in Seattle used to be kind and polite, but over time that changed too. Seattle became so dark and angry.
The Seattle city council and the state governance are to blame for all of this. The Seattle city council enables all of it and refuses to do anything to change anything. They sneer at the concerns of seattlites and I believe they're immeasurably corrupt and openly oppose and demean their own voter base with no fear of any consequence.
I really hope that someday I will return to Seattle and find a thriving, beautiful place like it once was.

"Here are my notes:
*Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back*
‚Ä¢	Read the great clinicians: Jung, Freud, Adler, Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow + Skinner (behaviourist).
‚Ä¢	 The neuropsychology of anxiety ‚Äì Jeffrey Grey (1800 papers worth of understanding!
‚Ä¢	Affective neuroscience ‚Äì Yak Pengsak (rats laugh).
‚Ä¢	Lobsters and serotonin (status, emotional regulation & posture). 
‚Ä¢	Competence (intelligence and confronting fears with courage) define hierarchies.
‚Ä¢	Confidence gives you the benefit of the doubt, for better emotional regulation + being taken seriously. 
*Treat Yourself Like You‚Äôre Someone You‚Äôre Caring For*
‚Ä¢	Jung says it‚Äôs an invitation for reciprocity ‚Äì people will treat you exactly how you want them to, you need to define this (the golden rule)!
‚Ä¢	How would you like your child to be treated?
‚Ä¢	People are fragile, prone to temptation and imperfect, which often gets worse, and capable of malevolence ‚Äì this is why we don‚Äôt like ourselves.
‚Ä¢	Love the sinner but hate the sin!
‚Ä¢	Taking care of yourself is a moral obligation to humanity, you have a light to bring into the world!
*Make Friends With People Who Want The Best For You*
‚Ä¢	People that aim down while you aim up are toxic (this can be part of you too).
‚Ä¢	You have an ethical responsibility to surround yourself with the best people that support your needs.
‚Ä¢	Be careful about who you share good/bad news with (jealousy and habit perpetuation).
‚Ä¢	Bad people don‚Äôt think life isn‚Äôt worth it, they demonstrate to themselves there is no necessity to strive forward by putting you down.
*Compare Yourself To Who You Were Yesterday, Not Who Someone Is Today*
‚Ä¢	Know Dostoevsky novels (crime and punishment ‚Äì murderer gets away with it [see don‚Äôt let you children‚Ä¶]).
‚Ä¢	Pareto distribution ‚Äì height, weight and intelligence are normally distributed.
‚Ä¢	Creative products are distributed in a Pareto distribution.
‚Ä¢	If you run a company, 80% of the employees do 20% of the work, 20% of customers are responsible for 80% of calls and sales.
‚Ä¢	In a given domain, the square root of a particular group of people do half the amount of work.
‚Ä¢	Matthew principle: To those who have everything, more will be given. From those who have nothing, everything will be taken away. 
‚Ä¢	Consider this in terms of opportunity. 
‚Ä¢	There is always going to be someone around who is better than you.
‚Ä¢	Jung thought the Book of Revelation was a pendant to the Bible, because the Christ in Gospels was too merciful. An ideal is always a judge. Revelation has Christ coming back as a judge. 
‚Ä¢	You need an ideal because you have nothing to aim at, but an ideal is a judge and you will always fall short of the ideal. 
‚Ä¢	Set a high aim, then break the goal down into parts that are challenging enough to push yourself past where you are, but not crushingly distant (reasonable probability of success).
‚Ä¢	At 30, the idiosyncrasies of your life make comparison futile as accomplishments are tailored by factors.
‚Ä¢	Make today some tiny increment better than yesterday.
‚Ä¢	Goals need to be laid out to justify life‚Äôs suffering.
‚Ä¢	Nietzsche says, ‚Äúhe who has a why can bear almost any how‚Äù.
*Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them*
‚Ä¢	Freudian nightmare: Circle where people are squeezing each other‚Äôs necks hard enough to strangle them in twenty years.
‚Ä¢	Carl Jung: The shadow (dark side of humanity) has roots reaching all the way to hell.
‚Ä¢	Literal & metaphysical application ‚Äì the very worst and then more proximal kinds of hell.
‚Ä¢	If you understand your dark side, you will see in yourself a reflection of the darkest potential. People don‚Äôt want to see this so they don‚Äôt, but this confrontation is an inevitable barrier to enlightenment.
‚Ä¢	Joseph Campbell: ‚ÄúFollow your bliss‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Jung: ‚ÄúPursue what‚Äôs meaningful and you‚Äôll encounter that which you least want to encounter‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	God of Horus (Egypt) was a God, but lost an eye in the battle when encountering evil. The Egyptian eye is that lost to Seth, the precursor to Satan.
‚Ä¢	Nietzsche punishment: don‚Äôt punish people when they do something wrong, this is a moral relief to them. Wait until they do something good, then hurt them.
‚Ä¢	When people do something you wish to be replicated, reward them!
‚Ä¢	Consult your irritability to prevent conflict and shape the times when others hurt.
‚Ä¢	Children must be socially desirable by four, we develop by playing! Adults like developed kids.
*Set Your House In Order Before Your Criticise The World*
‚Ä¢	Carl Panzram ‚Äì Panzram (autobiography) ‚Äì ‚ÄúHurry up you bastard, I could kill ten men in the time if takes you to hang me‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	Columbine kids diaries ‚Äì why did the kids shoot up the school?
‚Ä¢	The above were judges of being as motivated by resentment.
‚Ä¢	You must admit to resentment, its fantasies and the way out.  
‚Ä¢	A resentful person wants others to change are not to be trusted.
‚Ä¢	TS Eliot: The cocktail party ‚Äì ‚ÄúI hope that there‚Äôs something wrong with me‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	If I don‚Äôt like life, is my judgement to be trusted if I haven‚Äôt done everything I possibly can to set life right?
‚Ä¢	The Gulag Archipelago ‚Äì Solzhenitsyn. One man that stopped lying could spread the dissolution of the Soviet Empire.
‚Ä¢	GO over your life with a fine-tooth comb and determine when you took the wrong path when not shieled by ignorance. Take responsibility for where you are, what increased the probability that you came here and what would happen if set everything right in the present. 
‚Ä¢	Try not doing the things you shouldn‚Äôt do, not saying the things you know aren‚Äôt true (Mandela agrees).
Do What Is Meaningful, Not What Is Expedient
‚Ä¢	The Messiah takes the world‚Äôs sins upon Himself ‚Äì associated with Jung‚Äôs shadow. 
‚Ä¢	The terror that comes in the night <- book about sleep paralysis.
‚Ä¢	Ordinary men ‚Äì bourgeois police battalion moved into Poland, but told they could go back to Germany if it was too hard for them. They were sickened by what they did but didn‚Äôt stop (don‚Äôt compartmentalise this!)
‚Ä¢	For there to stop being Nazis, know that the Nazis were you, then decide not to do that.
*Assume That The Person You Are Listening To Knows Something That You Don‚Äôt*
‚Ä¢	Humility: What you don‚Äôt know is more important that what you know. There is more of what you don‚Äôt know in the world and your life isn‚Äôt what it could be. Make the identification of ignorance your friend!
‚Ä¢	Listen to people: Use wisdom as tools ‚Äì do you want to be right or learning?
‚Ä¢	People will tell you what is wrong in their life and how to fix that!
‚Ä¢	Engrossing conversations are transformative!
‚Ä¢	People think by talking‚Ä¶ what do you want? 
‚Ä¢	Use others as a foil for your thoughts.
‚Ä¢	Carl Rogers dictum (a trick to tell if you‚Äôre listening): someone lays out their thoughts, then you say, ‚Äúlook here‚Äôs what I think you said‚Äù, is that right. You summarise their argument for them, and you don‚Äôt get to make them into a strawman. 
‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt win the argument, fix the damn problem.
‚Ä¢	The misery of fixing the problem is worth evading the misery of not. What are you running both to and away from in your life?
‚Ä¢	Also listen to your enemies and how they criticise you.
*Don‚Äôt Bother Children When They‚Äôre Skateboarding*
‚Ä¢	‚ÄòStrong men are dangerous and hierarchies are built on power and society is a tyrannical patriarchy‚Äô ‚Äì historically ignorant. 
‚Ä¢	eBay proved the Western society is built on honesty. 
‚Ä¢	Success is built upon conscientiousness. 
‚Ä¢	Last 1800s, Nietzsche announced the death of god in the decimation of the divine masculine. 
‚Ä¢	Adopt responsibility for your life, your failure to participate in being leaves a hole in the cultural landscape. 
‚Ä¢	Restricting children‚Äôs play is a pathological inhibition of our fundamentally honest light.
*Pet A Cat When You Encounter It On The Street*
‚Ä¢	In overwhelming crisis or illness, shorten your timeframe until it can be coped with (the power of the present!). 
‚Ä¢	You can put up with a whole lot and not be corrupted.
‚Ä¢	Be alert to the unexpected beauty in life.
‚Ä¢	Be grateful for what you have and sustain yourself whether you‚Äôre successful or not. 
‚Ä¢	If we didn‚Äôt all attempt to make terrible things worse than they already are, then maybe we could tolerate the suffering we have to and make the world a better place!
*EXTRA*
‚Ä¢	Do not cast pearls before swine ‚Äì New Testament. If people are not listening to you, stop talking. Watch them instead, they will tell you what they‚Äôre up to. By offering what you have to say to those who reject it, you are devaluing what you are saying.
‚Ä¢	Look into John Taylor Gatto ‚Äì the relationship between the classic Trivium and the Holy Trinity and how has that changed over time.
‚Ä¢	Ideals recede as you approach them. A good person is someone who is attempting to be better.
‚Ä¢	Christ is the dying and resurrecting hero. You learn things painfully. In this, a part of you has to die. Life is a constant process of death and rebirth. The thing that emerges in the place of dead wood is worthy. 
‚Ä¢	Until the entire world is redeemed, we all fall short.",0.9189277291297913,C
"Last year I attempted suicide. I was newly single and jobless. I was living out of my truck and extremely lonely. I couldn't even afford data on my phone to properly communicate with the outside world, or my mother in England (I live in NZ). One day, when I was sitting outside a caf√©, using their free wifi, I saw a suggested video pop up of a ""Jordan Peterson Owns..."" I clicked on it. It was entertaining. That led me to watch other videos of his and soon I found out that he wasn't just someone who puts people in their place- but a loving, caring man with great wisdom and knowledge on how to fix the mess I called my life. I parked outside that same caf√© every night for a couple of weeks and I've been obsessed with his teachings ever since. I know he hears this a lot; and for good reason, but this man has literally saved my life. I keep his book on me like a bible and I revisit old lectures all the time. I'm no longer suicidal. I'm not longer homeless. 
I have a room to clean. 
Thank you, Dr. Peterson.

"Great work here by BBC. Credit when credit is due. 

No big surprise but a genuine recording that documents the last hours of the corrupt Tunisian dictator that ruled for 23 years with fear and blood.

What I realized listening to these recordings:
- Behind all the power fa√ßade, there was a house of card ready to fall. The amateurism of the regime is shocking. You'd expect a crisis cell / Taskforce leading the response to the major crisis facing the regime. But no. A call here with the defense minister, a call there with a friend. Nothing structured. The regime had clearly 0 preparation for such crises. 
- Zine was desperate and lost in his final hours. Very ill advised. Loyalists to him were virtually non-existent with everyone telling him not to return. This in particular represented a historical opportunity for Tunisia to start a new era with a relatively low cost
- The pilot deciding to leave is a question mark. Who gave him the order? I can't imagine him taking this decision on his own. There must have been some (external) intervention
- The psychosis of Zine and his regime. They lived in a parallel world. Zine didn't understand why the street was so angry. Then he believed that islamists (virtually non-existent with no presence on the ground back then) led the coup d'√©tat. Illusions. 

Glad to have been there. Glad that I was 28 at the time. Old enough to remember what was and  is still unforgettable. Long live the martyrs. Thank you BBC.",0.9455951452255249,L

You get to see that the illusion and appearance of power is not actually power, and behind it all are human beings. Without the strength of the personal use of the army and police, most dictators would fall in a similar fashion.

Interesting to see how disillusioned Ben-Ali was right up until the end saying it was the Islamist orchestrating the crew. I think that's what he wanted to believe and what he wanted others to believe but he knew it wasn't true, hence his question about the interior ministry",0.990069568157196,L

People who say tunisia was better under his regime are delusional  ..! 
Their argument is that the prices of tomatoes and potatoes have gone up since then ! 
They forgot that we had one of the worst police states in the world plus the economy was going to get this bad even if he was still in charge !

"I am a 24 yr old Egyptian engineer living in Germany currently working as an intern in one of the greatest automotive companies in the world only because of Jordan Peterson words about how to behave like industrious people. This guy saved my life from complete destruction.

 It was right after my horrible experience in the middle thesis of my masters that I felt completely lost, weak and insecure. I felt like the dumbest person ever. I worked in a part time job as a cashier just to prove to myself that I can do something worthy and valuable. Sometimes I would feel I am not even an engineer. 

One day I had  a really long day at work and we had a lot of annoying customers. I was completely down and depressed. It was an isolated industrial area in the forest, and the weather was freezing, and I had to wait at the train station for like 30 minutes. While waiting I looked up to the stars and wondered how I could end up here after years of studying!? At that moment I realized fuck it with any theoretical advises, I want any real practical actions that I find and I will follow starting from now! I opened my cell in the cold weather and carefully listened to a 6 minutes video of Jordan Peterson talking about industriousness behavior. His words completely changed my entire life. Since that day every single morning I set my daily goals, put a schedule and try to execute as much as possible. It is unbelievable how much one can achieve by just reformulating how we precieve tasks we have. There is a big difference between wanting to do something and having to do something. Setting goals means u want to achieve them and by achieving them u reward urself. Just amazing! Also amazing the power of planning on paper! 

I really want to thank Jordan Peterson for his guidance. Those are some valuable words, that I believe only Jordan Peterson have wanted to share with the people.

It's not always a matter of ""we can't afford to stay open here or keep you on"", in some cases it's ""we're making good money here but we can make way more"".

What I love most about Neil is his brutal honesty about what he does'nt know and his exactness for what he does know. And of course his ability to communicate both these things.,0.9766726493835449,L
Neil looks at the past and present all at once what a genius,0.901651918888092,L
"As a substitute teacher, I had to show one of Neil's videos to a bunch of middle schoolers. The topic? How life was seeded on earth by asteroids. This is the 'science' that leads kids to suicide. Think about: what is life if we are just, in words of atheist comedian George Carlin, ""Failed mutations."" In fact, Carlin thinks the planet would be better off without people on it. 
     In that same middle school, I found a book called, 'The Darwin Awards.' Kids are actually reading this and it is child abuse. The book details the gruesome deaths of 'stupid' people, people that society is better without! The first chapter was about a woman walking too many dogs. They pulled her into a tree, killing her. The 'joke'? ""I guess she was barking up the wrong tree!"" Hardee har har. 
     Do people have a brain anymore? Kids read this book and think, ""You know, this world would be better off without (mom, dad, 'friend', etc.) in it!"" Now, kids are going into their schools and blowing their classmates away. Of course, the evolutionists will swear that their atheistic, situational morality has nothing whatsoever with the amorality of the public schools.  
     The sad tragedy for atheists is that, unless they make things right with God, they will live in their own insanity for all eternity. Do people create their own morals? The torturer in hell will! In fact, Jesus said that those in hell will be tortured. It is not hard to believe, is it? God is justice and take away our courts, police and jails (no matter how imperfect), and life becomes chaos.  
      Yet, Christ died on a Cross so that we can know Him. By the blood of Christ, we can be fit for paradise, where there are no liars or thieves and the weather is always perfect. I hope you get to know Christ. Jesus Christ is the light of the world.",0.6703327894210815,L

"Now I get it! The concept of Multiverse, came from the same fabric during the big bang. Now that is something I can relate to.",0.6878986358642578,L
"I liked the conversation about intelligence. I would add, I would think that intelligence is secondary feature of life unlike locomotion and eyesight. For example, maybe the reason why intelligence isn‚Äôt common in the record of life may be because it‚Äôs not needed for life forms to perform the basic functions needed for survival. You think about technology. There was a point when your cell phone only made and received phone calls, and that was fine for the time because your device did what was intended of it at a basic level. You fast-forward to today, phones can order Sushi, direct you in traffic, entertain us when we‚Äôre bored, and even connect us in more ways than that was possible 30 years ago. All of these added features of modern cell phones (literally called smart phones) are secondary features that go beyond the primary functions for which the cellular phone was originally intended for. I always believed that intelligence played a similar role in the evolution of life. Intelligence is not a guaranteed upgraded feature of life, but it is a later feature of an advanced life form. Like I think it‚Äôs safe to say that mammals and birds are slightly smarter overall than the average non-avian dinosaur from 65 million years ago, and that dinosaurs are smarter than what proceeded them. So intelligence, even on dog-like level seems like a late game feature of life.",0.8187809586524963,L

The other issue I see is this; kids shaming and bullying other kids, the very kids who now identify as 'woke' so as retaliation fueled by Tik-Tok they now threaten others through social media.

"I had to rewatch this series of debates and listen to Peterson's lectures on Maps and Meaning and his biblical series before I could even attempt to comment, but here goes:

I think the main point that Peterson was trying to convey to Harris was that religion appears to have developed organically over the course of human history as a way to preserve and communicate abstract ideas and concepts that can reduce suffering and promote success in life in those who act them out. He tends to define these ideas and concepts as values (e.g. fairplay, honesty, etc), which we use in our daily lives as a moral compass for our actions. As a personal example, I train jiu jitsu every morning at 6 AM because I value physical fitness, fairplay, and strategy, which I hope will ultimately help me in my endeavor to live a meaningful life. The act of doing something we value is in Peterson's definition, religious. Therefore, he assets that even atheists tend to live a religious life because they act on values that they hold dear to their person.

Harris seems to assert that we as humans, have the ability to extract the same values that Peterson defined without the need for interpretation of the stories in religious texts like the bible. On top of that, he cites that dogmatic and literal interpretation of some stories has shown to be disastrous throughout history-responsible for war and death. There are plenty of examples such as the Inquisition, the anabaptist revolt in Muenster, the Buddhist/Hindu civil war in Sri Lanka, and ISIS. Therefore, I believe Harris concludes that if we can assume that humans can synthesize the ""good"" values in life without the need for religion, we should- the risk is otherwise too great.

Peterson's counter claim is that it is likely impossible for humans to be able to do away with religion and synthesize our own values. He's cited Nietzsche and post modernists like Derrida or Foucault often, claiming that social systems such as communism fail to address human impulsive tendencies and propensities for evil, which are not values, per se, but are addressed as vital and fundamental parts of most ( I say most because I'm not qualified to assert all) of the world's religions. Therefore, Peterson concludes that there remains significant value in respecting and acting out religious logos because they also help to recognize and reduce acts of malice.

So they're talking past each other, in some sense. I think the real question is: Assuming Peterson and Harris are correct, how can we implement religions without devolving into literal interpretations? I think they found the answer when they agreed to it at the beginning- free and frank speech.

The University of Minnesota in the year of 2000 when I was a patient there their employees beat me so bad, they used electric shock treatment to control my memory and it did it made me have memory loss for 21 years I forgot that incident. Right around Christmas when my Father Lord Jesus Christ birthday is, I remember that when I was in The battered women's shelter. I learned to speak out about what took place in my relationship with the Man I Love, the hospitals the police. and to tell the truth. The Man  I Love controls YouTube. There was so many readers reading tarot cards, now not as many the higher elite got rid of them. I was to keep my mouth closed, to just pretend nothing is going on. I can't, I'm am very gifted They don't want me to tell what I know. I am to be quiet about the things I have seen and have happen to me. and the killings that are taking place.

Another positive side is,  they also take the opportunity to copy the other design and make their own technology because they know the potential of the design that they copy can help them grow their own technology.
Meanwhile for the negative side is, they always copy other people design product and technology. As we know, laws in China did not strict as we expect. Their principle is they did not sue people that copy technology or design from others. When that happens, it will make the original person that develops the idea and technology incur high losses.

"Do I think Shenzhen will affect my business?

Yes, in both a positive and negative way. Shenzhen has an ecosystem that has a great supply chain from developing to manufacturing in a rapid way. Innovators and makers come to Shenzhen with the hope of realising their dream on creating new products that are better than the current market. Shenzhen provides that with massive availability and rapid manufacturing due to delegation of work, availability of components and widely adopted consensus which is ‚ÄúShanzai‚Äù that they are meant to help each other. In a positive way, this accelerate the manufacturing, innovating and designing process of a product. The swift delegation and accomplishing a certain line of work in Shenzhen is what makes the city attractive enough for major tech companies such as Intel to fabricate their own product there. Businesses and start-ups can easily cut down manufacturing time and cost by basing themselves here and take advantage of the ecosystem.
In a negative way, the Shanzai spirit they uphold and the always advancing technology due to innovations that are scattered around the city will give problems on monetising your product. The amount of imitation and counterfeit the city produces on the excuse of innovating and improving will give harm on a business due to inability of sustaining a product shelf life and maintaining the exclusivity of an established brand. Intellectual property, patents and copyright do not play a huge rule on protecting your products. The special economic zone created by the Chinese government allows them to copy and improve regardless of any IP protection the company adheres to. This caused a massive ruckus as we have seen between Silicon Valley‚Äôs companies and Cupertino‚Äôs Apple fighting in court with Chinese company due to copyright infringement. That does not stop Shenzhen from learning, copying and become better at what a certain niche companies do. This reason alone will become a huge obstacle for a company to monetise and maximise its profit.

What will be the positive and negative sides of technological advancement that occurred in Shenzhen city?

On a positive side, technology advancement in Shenzhen enables innovators and makers realise their product in a cost and time effective way hence accelerating the growth of technology. This has been the staple of Shenzhen for makers to realise their ideas and create a product that is suitable for their business model. Makers and creators on kickstarter.com and such have been choosing Shenzhen to be based on due to its continuing and sustainable ecosystem. Another positive note would be the advancement in technology will eventually benefit the end user. The rapid advancement will put pressure on big tech companies to improve as there are better products that have been released elsewhere and it will benefit the end user on having an improved products with multiple years of support from a company. 
Negatively, the rapid advancement provides little to no time for polishing the details on a certain technology. Products from Shenzhen are notorious for lacking refined details that would make a product looks finished or even good enough to use daily due to the race between competition. That alone will mostly be a dealbreaker if a company decides to pursue the race to sustain itself in the market. Another negative side would be the technology advancement is based on an existing technology owned by any company that has it. Makers in Shenzhen take the technology in a certain form, make it open source and share it publicly among the community and improves it. Although this might look good for technology, it is bad enough to severely cripple a business due to infringements and counterfeits that will take away their customers. This has been a major issue since the influx of technology in Shenzhen up to a phase where you can completely build a new modified iPhone operating on iOS without spending any money on an Apple Store.",0.9534048438072205,L

To execute a prototype will only take a couple of days while in other countries will take weeks or even months, plus its cheap which will surely be love for starter innovators .But monetizing a product will be a big problem since the place itself is an open source, the original creator basically may be defeated by another innovator that improves his original product and he cant do anything about it. When a city is advancing too fast, its goverment lost its track. Which mean that the people will have more power than the goverment on technology update. Therefore, it will cause the people to be corrupt or misuse it. The spread of the open source will also open up people to more innovative creativity, thus means more technology advancement product's. The big picture problem is that monetizing the product so that you can have your authenticity",0.36632275581359863,L

And the discussion of life, what it is, the precursors of life,  the metaphor of fire as life (59:06), and non-life vs life as a continuum rather than a strict line,  is very thought-provoking. This is among those intellectual exchanges of humanity at its best.",0.9901632070541382,L

"I absolutely LOVED this!


I'm a bit surprised that Mr. Kelly (nor his brother?) did not know of the proposed Nautilus (Artificial gravity) project which includes a full spaceship with a spinning ring (allowing crew members/astronauts to experience gravity, if only/at least while sleeping to offset some of the issues of microgravity) with an initial plan to have that Nautilus (spinning) ring attached to a portion of the ISS (as an initial test/phase prior to building the full spacecraft).  [You may wanna check this out with Google/YouTube when you get the chance]


Also, slightly surprised no one (Including the woman who asked the excellent question ‚Äì my favorite question BTW) mentioned the two great examples of this technology in the classic movie ""2001 a Space Odyssey,"" which includes TWO good Examples of this tech:


There is the giant ring we see near the beginning of the film (after the ""prehistoric"" section) and maybe more in tune with what we may be able to develop in the near future, on the spaceship that travels to Jupiter (""Open the pod bay doors, HAL"") where the ring is not as large, but allows the astronauts the ability to live work and exercise in at least partial Earth gravity.  


I would think by now we would have something like that as part of the ISS.  


Now for those who might counter, indicating that many of the science experiments deal with the effects of microgravity/zero-G,  I would add that maybe even the largest portion of the space station would still be not spinning/in 0G.  


Also, even if you had a giant ring and nothing else, at the very CENTER of the ring, you have Zero Gravity but then also, you would have the awesome ability to do experiments in stages (i.e., with higher and higher ""gravity,"" as you place those experiments farther and farther from the center.  


So you could, effectively, do experiments with Martian gravity at a certain point along one of the spokes of the wheel, etc. (proposing that the very outer edge of the wheel would be higher than Martian gravity).

I'm so glad that these former slaves gave an interview. Being black I know that most black families don't talk about slavery and the ancestors who were slaves.

My great grandma was born in 1928 and I was blessed enough to have her around as a consistent figure in my life for 30 years. I would question her about her child hood and she would only give me vague responses and then she would tell me I asked to many questions ( which didn't stop me I still kept asking lol) but needless to say she took her child hood experiences with her to her maker.

"If you enjoyed this, I highly recommend reading the book ""When I Was a Slave"". The book and the audio here are from the same project done in the 30s.

I do warn you - It'll break your heart. Most of those interviewed felt they were better off as slaves. Once freed some stayed on with their masters as paid labor. Others separated from their families during slavery wandered aimlessly. They were uneducated, poor, unskilled, and still the victims of heavy racism.
Even the abolitionists weren't much help. Despite not believing in slavery, they also didn't see black people as equals. And before Jim Crow laws, they technically had the same rifhts as everyone else, but didn't know how to make use of their freedom.

I am impressed that even with the considerable time he has spent pondering these issues, he looks for any rational explanation which might dispel his conclusions. That's a free thinker, no confines.
Lastly, I find it humbling after watching Dr. Peterson.

Crypto is arguably one of the most important parts of modern society. We‚Äôre in the midst of building the foundation of future law, politics and monitory systems, yet only a few people participate in the movement, probably because of the threshold for understanding internet, web, finance, global economics, crypto etc. 
This format invites a lot of people to start seeing things they never though about, but inevitably(probably) will be reliant on in the future. 
Not understanding crypto is like not understanding the creation of law & governance. In this stage of development, you have the opportunity to make a difference in how it will be structured & presented to the world. How will future digitalized generations interact with politics, money and governance?

"I am a Chinese majored in Computer Science. I think the gender study major in the west should never exist as an academic department, and it is toxic to the entire intellectual atmosphere in the University. Note that I strongly support women rights movement in the past centuries.

In the Universities in mainland China, we have a department called ""School of Marxism studies."" They apply modern social science theory to research on ""Marxism with Chinese characteristics"". Their publication is also nice looking, in a serious tone, with all the modern social science theories, but their entire goal is to prove:

""1. Marxism is right.""

""2. Marxism with Chinese characteristics is still Marxism.""

""3. China is still a socialist county on the road to communism.""

There is tons of Ph.D. and professors in the ""School of Marxism studies,"" however, I think they are so ashamed of their pseudo-science research that few of them dare to speak to STEM student to say: ""Look, I am a scientist as well."" Awarding that subject with the Ph.D. title is a shame to the entire academia. Why, because if they want to do real research in Marxism, they should do it in a proper philosophy, politics or economics department, so that their research can be challenged, disputed, proved or disproved by peers of a different view. In ""School of Marxism studies,"" your conclusion is already there, what you need is to prove it with an eloquent essay.

As a rule of thumb, an academic subject should not be established as such that its research (or pseudo-research) is revolving around an orthodoxical ideology. Whether such political ideology is just or unjust is another matter, science and research are entirely about Truth, not ideology.

In scientific research, we need to report our funders so that other scientists can know that if there exists a channel of interest to cause potential bias. Confirmation bias and vested interest are fairly common issues in STEM researchers. However, in each STEM field, different sides can argue and dispute over the publications so that any hypothesis is attacked, examined, and finally prove or disproved over time. To summarize: every researcher has his own belief and his own bias; To arrive at truth, in STEM we ask the opposition forces to attack each other vigorously so, in the end, we found the truth that withstands the challenge.

In physics, you can prove Newton Classic physics is wrong (or flawed). You will have a huge outcry in the circles, you will have both allies and enemy, but your career and physics research goes on. The simple matter is: the entire field of physics (or any STEM subject) do not depend on the orthodoxy of one particular set of theory or ideal. The subject that is founded on one particular set theory or ideal is religion.

In women study (or any other other identity politic pseudo-research), the entire founding structure is wrong in the first place. I am not arguing about whether today's women study is good or bad, rational or irrational. I think any Ph.D. in STEM major will realize the fact that the system design of current women studies as an academic research system will cause a massive confirmation bias and a whole industry of vested interest in the field itself.

Do you believe some Ph.D. in women study can publish a research hypothesis that white males are the disadvantaged social groups?

Do you believe some Ph.D. in women study can publish a research hypothesis that male are inherently more intelligent (by whatever particular measure) than the female, so that men are better at some jobs?

The above hypothesis is false IMO, but it is an important thinking game. It proves that there is a ""right answer"" and ""wrong answer"" of morality in the research, so some hypothesis will never be raised, and some conclusion will never be drawn. Moreover, graduates from women study virtually cannot find any job except being a teacher of women study or an activist. So if their researchers find that women are under institutional discrimination, the entire field benefit from it by collecting more funds and secure more teaching positions or jobs like ""chief diversity officers in google""(As a CS student I burst into tears when I first heard of such title :P ).

I am not arguing whether ""women are under institutional discrimination"" is true or false (I believe the claim is justified in someplace in China), I merely point out that there exist a chain of vested interest here. Most importantly, if someday, someone proves ""women are under institutional discrimination"" is untrue, if would dis-establish the entire field. Can you imagine the severity of it? The entire field of study will be demolished, that will be equivalent to proving Allah does not exist to Muslim. That is to say, hypotheses or research to disproving an certain argument in ‚Äúwomen's study‚Äù will be an existential threat to all the Ph.D. in the subject and getting everyone so mad at you because their entire life, entire research, and future career will be fertile.With such a closed loop of positive feedback without negative review, it is therefore never a wonder for me that women study become an echo chamber and radicalized.

Looking back in history, we would know that such moral ideal is a bad idea in reach science theory. Darwin theory which portrays a cold-hearted evolution by natural selection is not a welcoming thought in many religious people and defy the sanctity of the men. Many radical political thoughts (which cause mass murders) in modern time are inspired by Darwin theory. However, academia is not church; we should seek truth (however uncomfortable).

Darwin can be good Christian when he is a man in daily life, but when he begins to work as a scientist, he must distance himself from what he believes or what he would like the world to be. In research, the scientist ceases to be a man; he becomes the embodiment reason itself. After the research, he recovers his morality and ideal. A scientist may then decide to hide the uncomfortable discover, or burn it because it will bring injustice when misused. I think many people outside of STEM emphasis on too much on humanity, too little on the reason. They do not realize the importance of this duality of personality when discovering the truth require our cold-hearted rationalism, and hiding the harmful truth from public require our warm-hearted humanity.

I think every true scholar who is interested in women study, with the dream of obtaining truth, should leave that particular echo chamber. Real researchers on women‚Äôs issue should go back to common political science or sociology department where there is not a particular agenda or central ideology. Their theory may be completely right, but it needs to put outside of the echo chamber and face strict scrutiny to as befitting the academic standard. Having a feminist reviewing the paper of another feminist will not produce any real science.",0.7065915465354919,R

It is appropriate that during ones time in the University, at that age when we have so much to learn, the bulk of our energy is expanded on learning, and in the quest of truth. But not long after university the balance has to shift where we become agents of change within society,  even while we (for the rest of our lives) continue to seek the truth and rectify the courses of our own actions.",0.8824543952941895,R

"Diagnosed with T2D in Sep 2020, along with super high BP and weight of 264 Lbs, the ER were rushing to get me in the Cat Scan machine because I was dangerously close to either going into a diabetic coma or having seizures. A month later, at my Dr.'s office, my A1C was 10.8, my cholesterol very high and my liver enzymes were bringing me close to possibly developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease... I started researching how I could make changes and that's when I found the Keto Diet, as well as supplements to help both my liver and cholesterol levels. By Nov, my A1C was down to 8.8, Jan it was down to 5.9, both in Mar & May it was 5.4 and I will have it checked again in a few weeks, but I have already had it consistently controlled as of Mar. I have since added intermittent fasting and worked my way up to fasting between 18-20 hours daily with no problems with this whatsoever. I skip breakfast altogether and eat a fairly large brunch with a moderate portioned dinner, usually with both meals being consumed within a 4 hour window. I also drink only when I'm thirsty to prevent sodium loss and use plenty of Redmond ancient sea salt. As a result of my dedication, my liver enzymes and blood pressure stabilized, with much improvement in my cholesterol. My doc lowered my T2D meds and took me off of HZTZ completely. Now, just 11 months after that dreadful day at the ER, I weigh 172 lbs! Though I initially went on Keto to improve my physical health, it's benefit was also this whopping 92 lbs. lost in just 11 months! I never got the so-called ""Keto Flu,"" so I don't even know what that is. I also have zero problems staying on very low carbs, eating between 14-23 net carbs per day. I also never saw a ""Keto plateau"" that lasted more than 2 weeks or so, which prompted me to change something small (i.e. switching the times I ate or temporarily flipping my portions for a day or two until, voil√†, I was back to losing weight again and could easily revert back to my previous manner of eating). It seems that, sometimes, I just have to do something small to kick my body back into weight loss mode. Now my Dr. tells me that she wishes I could coach her other diabetic patients, but I have learned by TRYING NEEDLESSLY to help my younger sister, who has had out of control diabetes for well over 10 years, that you CAN NOT coach anyone into being motivated enough to truly control themselves, despite the fact that she can clearly see how much it has benefitted me. Sadly, no one can teach someone else self-discipline, especially after they have been afflicted for so long that they no longer have any hope left to give. Doctors, who are quick to please big pharma by writing constant prescriptions are failing to actually help their patients and bringing them to such a state of despair that they lose their will to try anything different. Sadly, this means that I will likely live long enough to see my little sister's last days. They are about to put her on insulin, which will be her death sentence... and there's nothing I can do to convince her that she does not need insulin since insulin resistance is the problem for type-2 diabetics to begin with. She is already churning out so much insulin that her body is, literally, ignoring it! How is giving her more going to help her in the long run? üò•

Wed, 17 Nov UPDATE: My A1C was, once again, 5.4 on my Oct Dr. visit. She took me off all diabetes & blood pressure meds and I am maintaining my glucose & bp just fine with Keto and IF only. I also lost 10 more pounds, for a grand total of 102 pounds lost in 14 months, though my weight loss has slowed. However, I am now within 27 pounds of my goal weight, so why stop?

My daughter was released after 2 weeks on oxygen and inhaler but my poor husband ended up being intubated 9 days after being hospitalized and then later put in a trach.

"irrigation+rainfall = evaporation + transpiration + runoff + leaching
 Which one of these processes do Farmers really have control over during the growing season?  If you have the ability to irrigate your sandy soils and water is cheap and plentiful, then you are fortunate and have some control on the left side of the equation.  If you do not have irrigation, you must look at the factors on the right side of the equation to see what can be controlled or minimized to benefit your crop.  Evaporation from the soil surface can be reduced with mulch or leaving crop residue on the soil surface.  Transpiration is a function of the plant leaf surface area and the weather.  Runoff is or should be minimal in sandy textured soils with high percolation rates.
This leaves the leaching of water out of the root zone as the #1 controllable loss of moisture to your crop.  Interrupting the downward movement of moisture in your soil by installing a ""smart"" barrier can greatly reduce the leaching of water and nutrients.  SWRT subsurface membranes detain/retain up to 90% of irrigation or rainfall in the root zone for crop use by disrupting the gravitational movement of water in the soil while still allowing excess water to percolate and do not create anaerobic soil conditions.",0.7694576978683472,R

My man would get his Oscar for Best Actor and he did not. Especially, In 1999.  I  flipped  out when The best actor award went to Kevin Spacey for his performance in ""American Beauty ""  Really ? Denzel Just did in my humble opinion,  one of his greatest  career performances as Rubin Hurricane Carter.  Please don't get me twisted. The only man I have ever been a fan of  in my lifetime,  was my father but I also know greatness when I see it.   I was sincerely disappointed with the academies decision.

In my view, Islam, in its struggle with confronting the modern times, has taken a back seat instead of the driving seat. In many ways, it lag behinds the role, it should have been playing. But it is still a driving force in the hearts of billions of human beings who somewhat live there lives morally around the family structures and have the virtues of generosity and empathy. And going passive rather than active helped Islam to negate any real corruption which other religions like Christianity have gone through. 
I would say that, we need Islamic Intellectuals for the betterment of the Modern World as was said by Roger. And Zaytuna is doing it as was said by Sheikh Hamza.",0.9838647842407227,C

Not particularly an anti-climate change tact, but moreso saying, until all of these elites who fly around on private jets, and enjoy 24./7 aircon in their houses, and don't mind paying $15/gallon (because they can afford it) change their houses to strictly off the grid electricity and start helping poor people pay for food for the children, they should f*ck off.

He says that ‚Äúall the data is out in the open‚Äù. What he means is that there are hundreds of hacked database dumps on the dark net that he downloads, collects and merges, which is actually true. Not sure about how it was back in the day, but he could certainly be right about the fact that the amount of data available in the open has increased. Some companies also just leave their databases unprotected with the default password or no password at all, not knowing that these databases are reachable over the internet, which he says by saying ‚Äúyou just have to look‚Äù. He also mentions ‚Äúexploits and software‚Äù that he uses to hack websites. The way he talks about it sounds like he‚Äôs just a user, he does not do security research.

Moreover, it is of arrogance for any religious person, regardless of his or her position of authority, to argue with absolutes when engaging giants of the scientific world. And the same is applied to the scientists who arrogantly debate in absolutes. The religious figures, as much as they reference their religious books or engage logical arguments, cannot prove the existence of God. Similarly, scientists who adopt an atheistic belief, as much as they use scientific references and engage logical arguments, cannot disprove the existence of God.

You did a ton of research for the cultural background. While I knew a little bit about abstract art criticizing the USSR I completely missed that connection with the Polyhedron.

I've seen several theories about her plot now, one of them being that since you're the player she's actively shapeshifting into being other characters sometimes, but I think your view of it is closer to the truth. In any case it really is a shame they just didn't have the time and budget to properly flesh out her storyline, so I have high hopes Pathologic 2 will be able to realize their original idea.

"While you linked the Bachelor's ending with 1917 and the Russian Revolution, I would argue that it's not just so plain and simple. I believe it's more a combination of 1917 and 1991 - in both cases a group argued for 'a better world' and destroyed everything that came before, only to see an elite materialise later that instead of leading to utopia would create a world quite different from that utopian vision. I'm a Russian, and although I wasn't born in 1991, I certainly feel that attitude of ""they destroyed everything and didn't create anything themselves"" from my parents and grandparents in regards to 1991 more so than 1917 (in part because they weren't born then, and in part because they saw that the USSR did actually bring a lot of good things). Nonetheless I do believe that the devs did refer to both - and I understand how it can be linked to both. I'm just pointing out to non-Russians just how much nostalgia Russians feel for the USSR and just how much hatred so many Russians have for Yeltsin and his group of reformers.

"The musical 1776 makes an interesting companion piece to Hamilton, especially through the lens of ""hey, what parts of the story haven't been told."" 1776 and Hamilton have a LOT in common, being about the founding of the USA, but 1776 doesn't really have any counterculture leanings to it. It does, however, very directly call out basically the entire cast for being slaveowners (or at least profiting from the slave trade) and being hypocritical when the northern colonies try to remove slavery in the declaration of independence. It's amazing, it's a whole musical number.

"Fantastic breakdown. I just recently watched the play and had similar hang-ups  about it. I saw several people objecting to the story and claiming that instead of casting white people with brown actors, they should have added the stories of black people at the time. I think I disagree with that. Bogging down a play with more characters just to add more historical stories wouldn't help Hamilton because that isn't the point, I think. Hamilton works because it's a re-appropriation of a white story by brown people. The story of the founding fathers is always going to be romanticized, either to glorify or demonize the historical figures. There will never be such thing as a truly accurate retelling of such a mythologized story. What we can do, however, is reframe the myth to draw comparisons to modern revolutions, to modern struggles to build the best country we can, and to the hope we have in the next generation. At the end of the day, I don't think it matters (in the scope of this particular story) that Washington and Hamilton weren't really anti-slavery or the play isn't truly accurate. What matters is that this version of the American myth puts the struggle for equity for everyone at the forefront, and that's pretty important.",0.6633881330490112,L

It was so confusing because there was so much love and generosity, but underlying there was so much control. Basically in the end I was shunned from this small group of christians who were like family to me for 7 years. The pastor kicked me out of the church for asking questions. After that none of my long time friends from the church would even talk to me. They weren‚Äôt allowed to. They cut me off just like that. Overnight. How very Jesus like.

however all i see in sauble beach now is just big developers following what the motel makeover girls do and buying up chunks of land for luxury hotel development.  a bunch of homes/shops are gone now and the whole area is slowly starting to get gentrified. honestly it's unrecognizable from what i remembered as a kid.. it's sad that a small costal town with a population of 2000 has become an afterthought to the rich, but i can't even have the memories i had as a kid either i guess.

In my hardest time in my life when I had hit rock bottom and I honestly wanted to give up on life. I had pushed my sins as far as I could push them and they was to heavy for me to carry. I knew there had to be more to life because if there wasn't I had made my mind up I didn't want to live.

"A bit late to the party, I know, but your final question about how GOW may depict Thor's personality got me thinking ...

I do believe the direction GOW will take is to make Thor a straight-up antagonist who plays against his primary roll of friend and defender of humanity, but I believe they'll do it in an unexpected way. Throughout the game we're inundated with story after story of how shockingly violent Thor seemingly is, but making him some mustache-twirling (or I guess in this case beard-twirling) villain or a snarling madman wouldn't be a satisfying or even sensible subversion of his supposed loyal and friendly demeanor.

I think what they're going to do is make him surprisingly cordial and eloquent. He'll speak calmly and clearly and present himself as unexpectedly professional (The ""calm and reasonable person"" line in the sequel trailer leads me to believe this). At the same time I think he'll be shown as someone who's shockingly good at putting on an act of being affable and quite charismatic.

Basically, he'll be a true clinically defined psychopath; someone who's amazing at pretending like he could be the friend and defender of humanity, but in reality he's cold and empty and perfectly capable of mass slaughter with no remorse. In my opinion, a sophisticated elitist psychopath pretending to be friendly to the ""lesser folk"" would be the perfect opposite of a warm down-to-earth working Joe who'd move the nine realms to protect the people.",0.8595593571662903,L

"Scandinavian here. I have, always considered Thor as a big boy. More muscle than fat, but the fat is definitely there. At least to me. Dunno if I would draw him the way the game devs did, as I think his shape should be more of a square. Like the types of strongmen who have some belly but it's more of a square than  a round. It would also fit his character better as Thor is generally pretty set in his ways and, as we say in Denmark, has square thoughts. Dunno how to translate that saying into English but it basically mean someone who has a bit of a stubborn outlook on life, whatever form that may take. That is also why it's so fun to pair him up with Loki whose personality and way of thinking is a lot more snake-like, creative and cunning. They are a very funny comedic duo when they are together. 

But yeah, I see Thor as a big boy, but not pregnant like the devs made this Thor look. However, they can do what they want. I played the other game with my friend who thought I would love it because I'm Danish, but I fucking hated it. These Norse mythology God pf war games certainly aren't for me, so in the end I can't be mad that they gave Thor a gut. I think the devs did many things that were much more disrespectful to Norse mythology in the other game than something as silly as making Thor fat.

We honestly have an amazing quality of healthcare, amazing safety nets to help the less privileged in society, and still have huge amount of flexibility in your medical coverage, while making sure nobody is left out.

"I always liked Jane more than Daria to be honest. I agree with what you said about Jodie being a mirror to Daria and I think Jane is kinda similar in that she's like if Daria found a creative outlet for all of her rage and cynicism. Don't get me wrong she's still bitter and really cynical but she also believes in something as much as it is fleeting. I don't know how but I think that has to be the way to actually be counter culture now. Cynical nihilism is the new normal and because of that it's radical if you actually care about something. Not in a, ""this will solve all of my problems"" kind of way but more ""nothing matters so I need to make it matter"".

That said, I hate an idea for a reboot. It may very well be the best thing ever but I honestly don't see it happening. If only because a reboot implies that they're all back in high school and if ANYTHING the last thing relevant to teens today is Daria's edgy 90's cynicism. Everybody who watched Daria back then has grown up from that time and everyone who's old enough to relate to a high school Daria would just see her cynicism as another edge lord that says they don't care about anything. How they expect any of that to work is beyond me.

However, while a reboot sounds awful, I would absolutely LOVE a sequel movie or series where all the Daria characters are early to late 20 somethings and they all have weird internet jobs. Jane makes an obscene amount of money doing furry smut commissions on Patreon to fund her passion projects, Quin becomes a lifestyle blogger/podcaster/author, Jodie still attempts to fight the system from within so she probably works at that universe's equivalent of Buzzfeed trying to do hard hitting journalism but is instead making listicles, and Daria is a lefty video essayist! Daria and Jane are still friends and they co-found that universe's version of Clickhole. Is it bad that I actually kinda want that now that I think about it?",0.26104092597961426,L

So it came full circle. Irony and detachment are now mainstream and commercial. It's like Daria went to a liberal arts college and found out all the other students were also Darias. All this proves that irony and detachment are ways of coping and surviving but not ways of truly living or changing anything. They're not enough.,0.637620747089386,L
"Being a black woman , I related to Jodie especially being seen as the ‚Äú token minority ‚Äú. I also got a lot of pressure from my parents because I was the ‚Äú smart one ‚Äú so they expect me to have a highly successful career and break stereotypes. I graduated with my bachelors degree last year and it‚Äôs still not enough. I plan on going to law school next year and it‚Äôs still not good enough for my parents.",0.6990740299224854,L

"I see Daria as sort of a happy accident of television history. It was extremely nuanced, something I highly doubt was even recognized by MTV at the time, much less intended. For them it was just another animated sitcom. A deliberate attempt to re-create this will very likely backfire, the announcement already sounds terrible.

If you want to make more Daria, why not a sequel about her as an adult trying to balance a boring job, a barely functional family, artistic ambitions, and political convictions in a post 9/11 pre trump america?",0.05805707350373268,L
"I think what made Daria special is the same thing that made the simpsons (early seasons) special: they both had a heart, yes, Daria is cynical and she always has the right comment for the right situation, but the series wasn't afraid to show us that she actually cared about people and things, that her gloominess was sometimes nothing more than a facade, you can see this is if you watch the show chronologically, you see her how she passed from always on the offensive, to start taking control over her own life and decisions, yes, those changes are subtle and through 5 seasons and two tv movies, but who changes from one day to another? I think she captures pretty well that awkward phase from: ""I know everything because Im smarter than everyone"" to: ""I know a lot, but not everything, but I know what I want"", phase that any teenager lives through.
This is why Rick and Morty's cynicism is pretty hollow, the characters say things they supposedly believe, but they dont act like it, they act in an ironic way all the time, to the point that is impossible to relate, as they dont take their own lives seriously, and if they dont: why would we?, Daria does say things that she doesn't believe, but the series points it out as contradictions and as any contradiction: she eventually faces them and grows up (as any person would do)
And the most important of all (and why I have the lowest expectations about the reboot), Daria did all of this but never went out of its way to show us the fact that it was doing all of this, because that would mean moving the spotlight from the most important thing to a lesser important thing, that most important thing being: the stories and the characters.",0.9807199835777283,L

Firstly, it would create a birthday lottery.

Having your birthday on a weekend is a privilege that I think everyone should have as equally as possible.

Eventually out of the quadrillions upon quadrillions of single molecules,  one formed a chemical that could reproduce. Most likely a virus type substance. Not quite living,  not really dead. From there all it had to do was clone itself like many chemicals already do. Then, with quadrillions of viruses,  some mutated,  some were damaged, some incorporated other chemicals,  some seemingly ate each other and started organelles. And ot pi f all those quadrillions,  only one had to survive its changes to start an entirely new species,  since they can clone themselves.  Now there's quadrillions of both types, competing and eating each other.  With new generations every few seconds. Let this go on for 4 billion years and you get complex life.",0.6948646903038025,C

"A day or two prior to Nov. 22nd, JFK's¬† motorcade went through downtown San Antonio, a video you can see on YouTube by searching for JFK's San Antonio speech.¬†At the very start of that video,¬†Gov. John Connolly's wife, Nellie, sat in front of JFK in the limo, as Gov. Connolly sat in front of Jackie, though later, on their way to the Brooks Air Force Base, John Connolly switched seats with Jackie and was seated beside JFK.¬†The wives sat in front of Pres. Kennedy and Gov. Connolly. To potential snipers lying in wait, this would have been¬†a logistical nightmare for the would-be assassins, positioned¬†in front of the limo since¬†it increased the chances the wives could be hit by gun fire, something LBJ and his conspirators would not have desired.


Little wonder the assassins did not take a chance on shooting JFK during the¬†motorcade in downtown San Antonio, what with¬†the first lady of Texas sitting directly in the line of fire in front of JFK because if bullets were fired at JFK either from behind or in front of the limo or even from a side angle, chances were very good Mrs. Connolly could have been shot in the cross fire, as turned out to be the case in Dallas when her husband, John, caught a bullet intended for JFK.¬†


Assuming JFK's murder was orchestrated by the one man who had the most to gain by it; Lyndon Johnson, the assassination team¬†possibly composed of rogue CIA agents and elements of the Chicago Mafia that were¬† designated to be the hit team for the San Antonio presidential motorcade had no choice but to remain silently in their sniper's nests in downtown San Antonio, their rifles quiet, knowing that they (or the next assassination team in Dallas) would still have another shot at Kennedy¬†in the next motorcade that was scheduled for Dealey Plaza. 


This time Johnson made sure John Connolly; not his wife,¬†would be seated¬†in front of JFK. Johnson¬†likely¬†quietly ordered¬†the head of JFK's¬†Secret Service detail to make sure Mrs. Connolly would not be seated in front of JFK for the Dallas trip, which is what occurred.¬†She inadvertently spoiled the assassin's chances of getting JFK in San Antonio by sitting in front of the president. The assassins could not afford to take a chance on killing a woman, the Governor's wife, even though they came very close to hitting Jackie in Dallas.¬†


Even if Gov. Connolly was shot accidentally during the next trip to Dallas, still it would not be his wife who would be hit. Has this point ever been brought up? The crystal clear video of the San Antonio¬†trip, captured on film, is in stark contrast to the grainy film seen on the¬†Zapruder film of JFK's murder.¬†I also find the audio of the cheering crowds very interesting because we can't hear a thing with the silent Zapruder film, as important as it is.¬†


Having had sniper training in the Air Force, I was drilled on shooting at targets from a variety of positions, so I am kind of approaching this line of thought from the mindset of the killers and what would work best for them and what would not work to their advantage.¬†The assassins could only¬†imagine what might Johnson¬†have done to them if they¬†accidentally shot any of the women in the motorcade. 


Now in considering all this; I have to ask, was there another fall guy, another patsy like Lee Oswald waiting in the wings, who was duped by the CIA into working in a building somewhere in downtown San Antonio in who Kennedy's murder could be blamed on, had JFK been shot and killed in San Antonio? Was there a revolving cast of sacrificial lambs Johnson situated in the various Texas cities Kennedy's motorcades went through? 


Because no matter where JFK was going to be killed, the conspirators¬†had to have plans in place for¬† redirecting¬†blame for the president's murder on a lone gunman to persuade the public JFK's murder was not part of a larger, darker plot. Of course, the question is always, why?¬†Kennedy would never have launched the US into a massive war in Vietnam. But Johnson¬†had much to gain financially from the military industrial complex that President Eisenhower¬†warned about in one of his last speeches as president. 


His warning meant to convey this, that some men, in the position of president of the US, could be bribed by the military contractors and oil billionaires to keep their industries going strong financially through continued government support and contracts and this has sometimes occurred through America's involvement in¬†war, enough times to keep these businesses flourishing as our tax dollars keep rolling into their pockets to keep America a military might.¬†


Already wealthy by the time he became president, Kennedy did not need the bribes that another man might drool for.¬†Kennedy did not want his legacy as president to be one built on blood but progress. But¬†Lyndon Johnson's long and brutal, bloody war in Vietnam showed us a man much different from JFK",0.44032832980155945,C

"One of the most perplexing comments I'm seeing repeated by atheists in the comment section is that Theism can be made to fit any set of data, in other words, it makes no predictions. What's fascinating about this comment is that it overtly contradicts the problem of evil. The problem of evil says that God's existence is improbable in light of the suffering in the world--in other words, Theism predicts a world that doesn't have the kind of suffering we see in our world--in other words, Theism makes certain predictions. These atheists are inadvertently saying that the problem of evil (and the problem of animal suffering by extension) isn't a problem at all.

"Thank you Cameron for your video and considered approach to Alex's challenge. 

I think you point out very astutely that Alex is combining two claims - godlessness and evolution - to make his case. But this does not give the theist a free hand to play an additional claim, as you suggest. Rather, it gives you the limited freedom to bolster your claim in only an analogous way. So, for example, your additional argument would need to have a similar probability to that of evolution, and not beg the question. 

I think fundamentally, Alex is not so much assuming evolution as saying ""imagine a world in which physics is the same, and that the events of the universe unfolded broadly the same way, but that there's no god."" Can we explain animal suffering here? Yes. Now add a benevolent and powerful god back in and try to do the same..",0.28061920404434204,R
"So, we have one goal: to explain why the Universe is in its current state. Specifically in this context, we have to ponder the following: why do animals suffer? In discussions concerning the existence of God, we have the following explanations:
- Atheism (implied naturalism): the Universe is self-evident; everything is a consequence of natural laws
- Christian Theism: God made the Universe; everything is according to his design
Alex O‚ÄôConner‚Äôs principle argument is that atheism explains the issue of animal suffering more readily than theism because it requires no moral considerations. It doesn‚Äôt seem logically plausible that God, an omnipotent and omnibenevolent being, would design a world where animals suffer. 



Cameron‚Äôs objections to this problem of animal suffering are as follows:
- Atheism doesn‚Äôt explain animal suffering because it doesn‚Äôt explain the existence of life in general
     - Adding the additional hypothesis of evolution makes the whole hypothesis unlikely because atheism still doesn‚Äôt explain the            existence of life
             -If atheism can add an extra hypothesis for explanatory power, theism can do the same
His first objection seems more like a problem with Alex‚Äôs presentation of his argument. However, if we consider Alex‚Äôs position to be naturalistic like I described above, the objection goes away. Doing this, Alex is no longer adding an hypothesis for explanation and is rather just positing naturalism, which makes his hypothesis still plausible. 



Furthermore, granting the first objection as true, it doesn‚Äôt reasonably follow that the last contradiction is also true. Adding naturalism to theism as an explanation to animal suffering inherently ignores the core of the issue: the two explanations predict two different things. While atheism and naturalism predict animal suffering (because atheism predicts nothing at all), theism would for some predict the absence of unnecessary suffering while naturalism would predict whatever is physically possible, which in this Universe includes tons of animal suffering. The task then for the theist would be to explain why God would tune the world in such a way that animal suffering is still thriving. 



I‚Äôm not saying that task is impossible, as that seems like what Cameron addressed in the latter part of his video. The trick is to offer explanations that don‚Äôt raise the intellectual price tag of theism (i.e. by adding extra qualities of God, more assumptions about the Universe, etc.). With that being said, Cameron did that kinda well, but now Christians gotta grapple with the idea that All Dogs go to Heaven is a little more than a movie‚Ä¶",0.1057504266500473,R

"What a nice discussion... may add something? I think this is where the Fermi Paradox kicks in... since in a christian worldview an all loving, all powerful god loves to create flesh and blood moral agent (i'm assuming that he loves more to create than destroy) then where is everybody? I mean I would assume that aren't there more sentient philosophical beings on another planet 'finely tuned' on that environmental planet? It all boils down whether a God only wants ONE conscious being to observe his creation like EVERYTHING in the universe?",0.49675852060317993,R
How can you suffer more than a human when you don‚Äôt even have a clue of your own existence? Big part of our suffering is due to the fact that we are conscious of our own existence. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,0.5537644624710083,R

"If soul building can continue in heaven, a place in which no suffering exists, then it follows that suffering _is not_ required for soul building. If you want to say it's a ""different type"" of soul building you still need to show why the type on earth is necessary. Millions of fetuses and infants do not survive long enough to develop their character, yet you assume they turn out just fine in heaven, correct? Well, if suffering on earth was not required for them in order for character development then it isn't required for humans that survive either.",0.44466015696525574,R
"Ok, I suspect there might bt a problem with this reasoning. Evolution might be extremely unlikely given just that there are no Gods, but in such case will also be extremely unlikely given just that there is a God. For any predication about God getting you a desire to create such and such a world you have to pay in theoretical complexity and the atheist can answer with a similar move -- add a disposition to the universe. So you won't get ahead of Alex here -- actually if anyone is ahead here, it is the atheist, because you as a theist are committed to this disposition of the universe as well, so you just have more theory to explain the same thing. But you claim to get ahead where you compare two very different ""auxillary hypotheses"". One is evolution, to which you are both committed(!) and the second one is God having reasons for allowing animal suffering, which Alex would deem implausible.

So your comparison should really look like is this:
theism + evolution + God having reasons to allow animal suffering vs atheism + evolution
Now you could say: but wait, Theism + evolution already entails that God had reasons for allowing animal suffering, there is no other way. Yes, but that is the point. The entailments of the conjunction present on both ends -- a/theism + evolution are extremely implausible only for one theory. The fact that you have to complicate your theory in response to an argument in an ad hoc way is exactly proof of the arguments strength. This is what makes problems of evil serious and this is also why you might think you could explain any observation by postulating some mysterious reasons God has ad infinitum and still end up on top, but In reality you absolutely cannot. By adding to your theory without independent justification and thus making the contributions entirely ad hoc, you are stacking theory vices.

At the end of the day you could analyze this the way G. Oppy does: compare the theories. This way you'll see that by moving from naturalism to theism, you've paid in complexity and have gained nothing but vacuous explanatory depth and a being that will be a victim of unconstrained predication.

So, in summary, your conclusion depends either on a huge prior for theism or a grand success of fine tuning arguments, on which I would not count.",0.16826371848583221,R

"Animal immortality strikes me as an intuitive and natural consequence of Christianity at least for any animal that any saved human cared about plus a selection of others.  I believe the human attachment to animals is way too strong for it not to be part of our souls, and if God is love, when resurrecting us we will be provided with all the things we naturally need to be happy in our environment.  Other living creatures is one of those things, and if we're resurrected from Earth and already attached to particular animals, it stands to reason God would meet that  need with those animals.",0.8082984685897827,R

"I saw Star Wars in the theater when it was first released in 1977. I was the target age Lucas was aiming for and I already was a fan of science fiction/fantasy movies (King Kong, Ray Harryhausen, Sinbad movies, Godzilla, Universal monsters).

I remember the first image I ever saw of Star Wars. It was in a magazine given out in school called Scholastic Magazine. It was a small B/W picture of the stormtrooper on the giant lizard. It reminded me of a gorilla soldier on horseback from Planet of the Apes (of which I was also a big fan). It was the only thing I could compare it to. Prior to that I knew nothing about Star Wars. I was wondering what it actually was I'm looking at. Whatever it was, it was cool and I had to see it. When I did see it, I was blown away. Last time I was blown away by a movie in the theater was Jaws two years earlier (where I also became a John Williams fan with Jaws being the first record album I ever owned. Now he composed the music for this Star Wars which I also got on 8 track).

As far as Star Wars goes today. I guess I'm all Star Wars'd out. I'm simply not interested anymore, especially with the new stuff. One of the things I loved about Star Wars was its 'mystique'. That's all gone. There's just way too much Star Wars these days (way too much of everything actually). I think I liked it better when there was less of it.",0.9059919118881226,C

"Here's why Lucas' Star Wars endures; there's always new things to see that spark the imagination, and each saga episode goes deeper into its own lore - the second death star is a completely different battle, because Luke has to go *inside* and face his own dark side - the stakes are totally different. People think these movies are basic movies of good vs evil, but the writing is about how we *choose* whether to be good or evil. It's all interconnected, whether you agree with the choices or not. It's constructed to tap deep into our psychology. As Lucas said, it's not about space ships, and lots of imitators failed in thinking that.

The Disney sequels are completely surface level, to the point they mimic ideas and scenes without the dramatic weight underneath them. Example; in ANH Luke has to choose between being out for himself (like Owen and Han) or part of a bigger world (like Obi-Wan and Leia), and those philosophical stakes get a dramatic reversal when Han is leaving with his reward, and then comes back to *save* Luke. We also have faith (Vader, Obi-Wan) vs technology (Han, Tarkin). That's why the climax of the movie resonates so much.

We don't get this in TFA, because Rey nobody had nobody to talk to except a mystery box. The first time Kylo and Luke meet on screen, Luke apologises and dies. The first time Han and Kylo meet on screen, Han apologises and gets killed. The sequels are about fractured mentor/apprentice relationships, and not even done with any real setup. It's not what people come to Star Wars for. The other crime is when the sequels make fun of the Star Wars galaxy and have it laughing at itself - Lucas never did that. It is very goofy at times, with pratfalls etc, but characters don't make fun of their galaxy, and most of the silliness is limited to droids and aliens.

Luke gets saved by Han in the climax of ANH, saved by Leia, Chewie & Lando at the end of ESB, and saved by his father in the climax of ROTJ, yet for the sequels Luke was the ""legend, blinded by his own hubris""? OK, then...

Lucas, for all the mockery he gets, was always imaginative and subversive (in a good way). As Marcia Lucas has said, on the record, Lucasfilm and KK don't understand what they're doing. I don't think we can classify her as a 'toxic fan' or ""man baby"". The Mandalorian was a big hit because it was much closer to the vision of Lucas, and Favreau and Filoni have a much clearer concept of what it is; fatherhood (and/or chosen family), compassion vs greed/fear, choosing to do the right thing. You don't even need Jedi or lightsabers to make popular Star Wars stories.

People think of the saga 1-6 as being 'blockbusters', but actually they are big budget independent movies, made by an experimental/documentary filmmaker/producer. The saga, with the exception of Kershner's ESB is shot largely as a documentary, and the story is told through R2 - who was of course sidelined in the sequels in order to have the charmless BB8, an imitator of R2, so JJ's 'Bad Robot' production company would pay less royalties to Lucas for the merch profits, and take a bigger slice for themselves. And in Rise of Skywalker, they gave BB8 its own BB8 style pet in the form of the D-O droid, for good measure. Utter nonsense.",0.9107366800308228,C

When you see at The Mandalorian or The Book of Boba Fett you can see that there's no bottom below. No depth. They just exist for the seek of existing. Baby Yoda is popular not because it does anything (it doesn't do anything at all) but because it's cute and it's live action.

"It's the equivalent of our US government intentionally trying to topple the government of a sovereign nation. They had a rich country that gives care to its citizens in a form of socialism too close to USA for their liking. If US citizens see a country that gives care to its people they might in turn, wish for the same in USA. The fact that they also have oil, more than any other country in the world, makes toppling the government ever more enticing. Sell us your oil and work with us or we will try to form an opposition army of citizens to topple you from power. We want profits and oil and control over you just as we do with any country that wants to stay in power and has something we and our oligarch overlords   need/want. It disgusts me what our power hungry government does to any country that finds our control abhorant. We control the OPEC production and so we make them drop their pricing so as to prevent a country that holds out against our control to not be able to pay their debts. Starve the people and manipulate them into protest against their government. We can use our MIC to invade the country to 'save the people'.. That allows expenditures to be used to maintain our purchase of more arms from the sector that funds our government (MIC) elections, gets the exports we want, force the government under our control and force the other governments we control to assist in our taking over another nation by sanctioning their country' if they do not do what we want. Russia and some smaller countries can not be controlled so we make them the fall guys for all problems in the world. They're the enemy of USA because they insist on remaining a sovereign nation! How dare any country not allow to be controlled by US and its 'allies'! Who the heck do we think we are?!? It's not our world, it is our country. How would they like having a country control them in who can be elected, what they can sell in world markets, how much they can sell, what type of government they can have, etc. Too many of the electorate  are ignorant of these manipulations but if we could educate how these actions are  effecting the world's economy (including our economy) and our mixing pot of citizenry. If they knew that some of what we are doing is responsible for the influx of brown people they may then care what we do to other countries. We do these things to control Middle Eastern countries and the fear of terrorism has the electorate voting towards protecting  us and they won't care of our control over others out of fear. Many do not care what we do to others as long as it helps get what they want and keeps them safe, or so they think so. Our invasions kill troops, but in our country many will say, 'that's what they signed up for', when in fact poverty and a future is the driver of many voluntary enlistment. If the money spent for war went instead to better Americans lives; people would oppose those who control our country for those in power and we'd oppose Corporations that control most of what they do. It is not we citizens who benefit from all these happenings.

Excellent interview overflowing with detailed information,0.8357799649238586,L
"Excellent analysis in this show. Nothing lasts forever and there must be consequences for US bad behaviour.
Eventually there will be a critical mass of countries who are the custodians of the essential resources upon which the United States relies upon for its own existence as a society [dysfunctional as it is].
These countries will develop a clear and realistic understanding that the US only ever acts in its own interest and has no interests what-so-ever in respecting the sovereignty of nations it, in reality, is dependant upon.
The economic and influence of China, its growing military might and Russians military assertiveness are major factors determining the US increasing ‚Äúsiege mentality‚Äù and imposition of sanctions on any country that chooses to act in its own sovereign interest aligning itself with Russia and /or China and trading partners. These are the countries with abundant natural resources and/or high industrial and economic potential. 
Over time these countries will establish a trading system that freezes out the US as a negatively coercive and non-reliable partner.
This is point at which the US will flex military power globally to threaten ‚Äúnon compliant‚Äù nations.
But this is also the point at which the US must be denied access to the natural resource upon which it relies, and the point at which the US dollar MUST be dropped as the world reserve currency. Those dollars must be made to flow back to the US and the US left to deal with the resultant hyperinflation.
As state previously: the US is an aggressive, coercive, unreliable partner. As such it must be made to suffer the consequences of its disrespectful behaviours anything other than this is not healthy for nations nor sustainable as a global norm.",0.9605051279067993,L
"Why do they impose sanctions?  What is the reason the US gives? Do they give reasons that the US State Dept. actually believes or are they total BS?

Are they complex, simple, a mystery or all of the above?

When you think about sanctions and then secondary sanctions and then other things that essentially work as sanctions and then all of the other unspoken kinds of sanctions.  Then all of the consensus of hostility that is endorsed by much of the international community and the biggest supra state institutions like the UN.  What is the rationale for the US deciding they want to recognize Bozo the clown as the President of Venezuela?

"EU officials talking about ""smart"" sanctions is also garbage. A prime example would be Greece. The econmic politics of the EU to ""save"" Greece destroyed a lot of wealth there, crippled the health care and retirement system and opened up the state economy, so private corporations could loot state wealth. So it does not even have to be smart sanctions. Even if they pretend to help, they often rather destroy wealth and lifes. Those, who really got ""help"" were for example the Societ√© General or Deutsche Bank. who gave loans i.e. to sell German tanks to Greece, which are pretty much useless there in mostly mountainous terrain. There were corruption trials in Greece, but of course nothing consequential in Germany and the fraudulent loans and deals were protected by the Trilateral commisson.",0.4280039966106415,L

"This hits on a point made by Hannah Arendt regarding the atomization of individuals leading to revolution. Some have, I believe, misinterpreted her remarks as atomization being a tool used by totalitarian governments to pull people under their umbrella, but I think that isn't what she meant. 

I believe that what she was referring to by atomization was the reduction of the citizen's individual power on the public stage. In a democratic system, the citizen receives a political voice through their vote. When you vote for someone and they get in, they represent your voice on the public stage. When you vote for someone and they lose, you can be disgruntled but you know that you will have a chance to change things in the next election. But when you vote for someone and they win, then they go on to implement policies which are the opposite of what you voted for, you feel betrayed. Your vote means nothing, as even when you win they still don't bother to represent you. You have effectively become an atom in the sea of countless other atoms. Your individual opinion doesn't matter, so you find political movements which give you some semblence of a public voice. All they ask is that you give up your automony and adhere to the rest of the group's beliefs in order to garner solidarity. 

This is how poverty becomes disconnected from the political instability. Usually, by failing to represent the citizens, the politicians will exacerbate poverty in favor of propping up big businesses, so it appears like poverty is linked to the instability. Instead, the instability is related to the lack of representation, not the poverty. Therefore you can have a political system that does a good job representing the will of the people but still experiences high levels of poverty without becoming unstable. 

At least that is how I interpret this situation.",0.4566311240196228,L

He explains that at the cosmic horizon, there will be quantum energy (fluctuating particles). It's not clear if this is true before all matter passes through the horizon, but nevertheless, the cosmic horizon is described as the distance form a ""fixed point"" (the sun) to an object moving with the speed of light. My ""questions"" are therefore:

Would this not be true for ANY point in space? Depending of what object you would choose as fixed.
And as a result the sun (or the earth) would be at a cosmic horizon? Actually, any point in space would at a cosmic horizon. Is this messurable?

"I went through interrogation school at Quantico as a Marine scout sniper. The instructors were both Marines and FBI agents.  The most important takeaway was that people lie the way they breathe; naturally.  We have been lying since we were children in order to escape punishment.  We are all good at it.  To get to the truth the interrogator needs to remove blame and punishment.  As soon as the person being interrogated believes they are in a safe environment they begin to relax, and their relaxation is palpable.  The effective interrogator constructs an environment of safety.  When a person feels safe their lies become much more apparent because of their relationship with the interrogator.",0.9229825139045715,C

"I don't think aggression can be used as a sure-fire way to detect lying. It's infuriating and scary to be accused of something you didn't do especially if it's something serious and you might get put away for someone else's crime. Not to mention people who have grown up in situations where they were frequently blamed for things they didn't do, they would naturally be way more aggressive cus they're sick of being the guilty one. 

I used to go to a babysitters after school and there were a few of us. One of the girls was several years younger than the rest and if she cried for any reason or seemed upset, us older kids would often get questioned why she was upset. And the babysitter's tone would usually already indicate she wanted to know WHAT we did vs. if we did anything in the first place. We weren't bullies and didn't pick on her, so it got pretty grating and upsetting.

I remember one time we were all just watching TV and the younger girl got up and left the room. A few minutes later we heard the babysitter calling us asking why she was crying and we were just baffled. It wasn't even like we'd been playing with toys and unintentionally left her out or took a toy she wanted without realizing. Still have no idea why she had been crying. 

Similar situations from my former home life along with this example from growing up have caused me to often become very defensive and explanatory when being falsely accused since I've often had to defend myself in the past to people who had already pretty much assumed I was guilty of something. 

You get sick of being accused or confronted for things you haven't done so often,  so any following accusation from anyone is already meeting with an already short fuse and little patience for yet another false claim.",0.24329203367233276,C

I may raise my voice and try to convince them that what I‚Äôm saying is in fact, true! Sometimes I feel like you can see some minor aggressiveness in people who are desperately just trying to be heard or believed because they ARE telling the truth. Imagine, for example, your marriage is on the line because your wife doesn‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve been faithful. And you have been. And no matter what you say, she doesn‚Äôt hear or believe you. You can‚Äôt tell me you wouldn‚Äôt get frustrated and upset because you could lose someone you love over a false fact that they believe.

"As someone with a background in body language analysis, non-verbal communication, psychology and all the stuff Susan is discussing here, I am pretty shocked.  If she is in a position to train the CIA and CEOs, it‚Äôs worrying.

About 25 minutes in, she has not even mentioned the most important aspect in this type of analysis, which is establishing a baseline.  She fails to touch on individual baselines which is 100% necessary to understand before any analysis can be considered effective.  On top of this, Susan suggests certain behaviour is proof of deception/truthfulness which is wrong.  Body language and behaviour analysis is not a strict set of laws and concrete facts, but instead a science and art that requires a blend of analysis, interpretation, and psychology only to establish likelihood instead of fact.  Nothing can prove deception, only suggest a raised possibility of deception from a psychological standpoint.  To suggest it is 100% effective is  itself, deceptive.

Susan also states so baseless claims.  One she seems to be hind of is that in the first 5 seconds, a liar will show clusters of behaviour which prove deception.  As I stated nothing is 100%.  But despite that, there is no 5 second rule that she seems to be hyper-focused on.  People can display single or clusters of deception (outside of their baseline) at different times at different rates of occurrence.  A deceptive person can lie to you and show no psychological clues for much longer than 5 seconds.  It all depends on the individual‚Äôs personality, the stakes, the questions being asked and who is asking, the social atmosphere, the current emotional state of the one being questioned, among a boatload of other variables.

That was one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. Brilliantly made and acted. It gave me a whole new insight into the war in Afghanistan. Lord that was a SMH moment when Tapper said your brother's deaths was hopeless. I cringed at that before watching the film but I felt it a thousand times stronger after watching it. You said ""We never felt like we were losing until we were actually dead"". What I saw was maybe slightly different. I saw guys who had already won and then happened to die. We all die. It doesn't mean you can't win along the way. You let the shepherds go. That was a win for humanity. It took a hell of a lot of the enemy to bring down a few of you. You kicked ass and took names and after you'd won there was just too many of them left. The villager who saved you was an honourable man and his son will grow up to be another. All I saw there was win win.

I imagine the survivor's guilt must be intense but if you could talk to your brothers again I think they'd say ""It's ok bro, it's all good, we're at peace, we're in no more pain. All we want of you now is to live your best life."" You know for a certainty that any one of them would have given his own life for yours, in a blink, in a heartbeat, without a regret or second thought. The fact that you made it out would give them immense joy and great peace. The fact that you made it out speaks even more to their own heroism. Who knows which of them killed the enemy who had a bullet with your name on it before he could even fire it? Anyway, If you hadn't made it out who would tell their story?

Hero is a small word. It doesn't seem big enough. Heroic is a bit longer but still nowhere near enough. You know how sometimes a brand name becomes the generic term for something, like ""hoover""? Maybe some day people will say ""Now he was a real luttrell"" instead of hero. Anyway I'm rambling on. I'm just an old British fart who never served so I'm not sure how important my opinion is but what matters is your brothers in arms would be so so proud of you. All give some and some give all.

"Wow. I just discovered your channel and dove deep into your content ‚Äî I'm amazed. Your work is unique. Touching. Informative. Talking specifically about this video, I can say that I heard a lot about LA's ""dark reality"" but didn't believe it is as you showed.

Especially during/after the pandemic.

I'm originally from Rio de Janeiro: a city a lot like LA when it comes to drugs, wealth distribution, and how precarious is the treatment of homeless people ‚Äî plus the violence from police, drug lords, and militia; normalization of crime; and extreme pollution of air, soil, and water.

And absurd prices!

For the last year or so, going through a serious depression after realizing I don't have a family (and that's where your video about father figures came in, 'cause I wrote an essay about how Kanye's musical expression of faith in a male omnipresent figure became something like an anchor for my atheist personality during hard times) all I could think about was moving to LA to write scripts for movies.

I'm [struggling as] a full-time writer and novelist in Brazil. The ""promise"" of having ""a chance"" in the US seemed tangible for a hard worker like me.

I now think this is an illusion.

I would probably be trading a problem for another (at a higher cost) so I decided to move to a different Brazilian city (Florian√≥polis) where crime, violence, and poverty aren't as common. The problem ends up being prejudice against women, black and gay people, but the chances of someone putting a gun in my head because they want to steal my shoes got down immensely.

Watching your content made me realize that even though the dream of ""making it"" in my career is solid inside an insecure construct like mine (basically of an orphan seeking external validation) I should do it where I am ‚Äî not in LA.

Maybe in Sweden.
Or Finland.
Just not LA.

Thanks for sharing. It'll be helpful for me to decide my next destination as a digital nomad ‚Äî and adept of one-bag living.

I also want to thank your patreons for the support they give you. It does make a difference. üëç

To attempt to now add on top of that a Special Tax runs afoul of the law in the sense that it represents a form of DISCRIMINATION because it singles out a particular form of behavior and (b) Means that people are being charged in a sense 'twice' for the same thing. For example, at one extreme end, 'no one' is paying effectively a PREMIUM (in a Health Insurance Sense) for the level of financial risk they/their particular situation might represent to the state and so to NOW add in a special charge for a PARTICULAR form of behavior/expression represents a form of DISCRIMINATION against individuals, In other words,/governments in attempting to do this are discriminating against members of society favoring one form of behavior over another form of behavior WITH NO REGARDS WHATSOEVER FOR THE ACTUAL FINANCIAL RISK/COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

ALSO, it represents a 'Preemptive Strike' ‚Äì for example ‚Äì- the fact of the matter is that given the low risk of requiring hospitalization because of covid ‚Äì particularly, with this Omicron variant ‚Äì that would mean that you would be charging 99.9% of the population a Special Charge for a MEDICAL Intervention they would likely, never, ever NEED?

I think a strong legal argument could be made that: ""YOU CAN'T DO THAT!"". You might be able to get away with denying people treatment if they didn't by such extra 'coverage' ‚Äì but you couldn't do it PREEMPTIVELY.

This is the kind of like 'classic' story about what it means to be a transwoman. So I think people who don't fit that theory, at least historically, have had a much harder time transitioning, or have had a much harder time reaching the conclusion themselves that they should transition or could transition.""

"Interesting video and I would like to say thank you for having  these kind of conversations, there aren't enough on the internet right now.

I don't understand however the idea that 'autogynephilia' is wrong or false. As someone who experiences, to the fullest extent of my sexuality (there is nothing else which stimulates me), completely asexual (anoloerotic) autogynephilia saying that it is ""wrong"" makes no sense to me. Saying that it does not describe you, absolutely fair enough, but just because it does not describe one person doesn't mean it doesn't describe another. If the intention of the statement was ""not all transgender people are autogynephilic"" then that makes more sense to me, as there are cleary some who aren't. 

The difference between me, and other autogynephilic people is that I have managed to retain a lot of self appreciation and contentment in being male outside of a sexual context. If you over indulge in porn or act as female too much outside of a sexual context it will cause you gender dysphoria (which I have experienced a large amount of in my life time). Naturally, gender dysphoria is absolutely gonna be the main driving force behind transgenderism. The point Blanchard is trying to make (in my opinion) is that many people who become transgender are doing so due to gender dysphoria brought on by autogynephilic actions. 

I don't know why people dislike the term autogynephilia. I am happy to embrace it, it's who I am and I am not harming anyone being so. If you claim that it is ""invalidating"" or ""used as an insult"" then that is your own personal issue, please do not try to take away the word from people who are comfortable in their own mind by telling people who cannot possibly relate that science is lying to them, it's not ""wrong"" for a lot of us.",0.8556287288665771,C

"""Chemical depression""

That's american scientific reductionism in action right there. Saying depression is chemical equals to mistaking an identity for a cause. Any mental state, any mood or feeling or thought has a biochemical substrate, and is ""made"" of chemistry. But ""chemical depression"" implies the causal chain that gives rise to the mood pattern is entirely chemical, which is a ridiculous thing to believe, and much more ridiculous to subscribe to as an entire culture. A purely biological etiology for depression is extremely rare, mostly just endocrine dysfunctions or brain damage. All the rest is the eternal and unescapable two-way dance of genes and environment.

However this silly belief helps us accept that, since depression is chemical, the cure must be chemical as well. A cure which we incidentally monetize en masse. Also it keeps us from questioning what in our culture, way of life and material conditions contributes to the epidemic.",0.638184666633606,C

"She is absolutely not a realistic and relatable strong female character for several reasons.

1. During her derby race as a kid, she really did need to slow down on the turns. But because she was immature, she ended up nearly break in her neck from bad judgement. Her dad, who not only let her race but also most likely helped her practice, yelled at her for good reason. ""You don't belong out there!"" Translation: ""If you are going to be reckless, you don't need to be doing this.""

2. The group of men mocking her on the obstacle course are heckling her to motivate her. Has no one seen a military movie before? Has no one hung out with a group of men before? EVERYBODY gets heckled and mocked in training, because it's character building. Tough Love. If she was so immature and self-victimizing to realize that she was not the only person being verbally harrassed, she doesn't belong in the military.

3. The message of her being ""too emotional"" is a jab at women being more empathetic and verbally high context. She is not emotional! She is overly sensitive and incapable of taking criticism. That's not emotionality!

4. I have had far more criticism and bullying from other women growing up. I could count on one hand how many times I was bullied by a man on one hand. Half of them were just off color jokes that went too far, and the others was one particular boy who was obnoxious.

5. She is sooooo arrogant! I cringe internally and externally any time she makes an executive decision. Legitimately, if she were a man acting that way, that character would still be a massive jerk. My best example isn't from this movie but in End Game when she tells Rocket from Gaurdians od the Galaxy, ""Earth isn't the only planet that needs help."" Oh, really, Cpt Meh-vel? You're going to to tell the person who has literally been traveling the universe helping different planets, too? This is why mansplaining ia not a thing.",0.014977495186030865,C
"I absolutely hated when in Endgame she essentially said that they lost because she wasn't there, and now because she is, she'll win. her entire character to me is extremely arrogant and not likable at all. there's a difference between a strong character and a complete asshole. and to those who'll say Tony Stark is also an asshole, yes. you're right. But he also has flaws and redeeming qualities that make him human and relatable. Captain Marvel is basically flawless (not a good thing) and has no redeeming qualities at all.",0.5278698205947876,C
"After a second viewing of the movie. I think I found what made it fall flat for me. One of the first ""superheroes"" I liked was Goku in Dragon Ball and I'll never forget a line he says that speaks to his character and relationship with his power, ""Power responds to a need, not a desire."" With nearly every other Marvel character, we get to spend time with the character before they have power and see that they're responding to a need. It's a really important part of what gets you to bond with that character. With Tony we spend a fair amount of time seeing him in his playboy persona not caring about profiting off war. Until he gets captured in the desert, nearly dies, and watches someone he respected die in front of him because of the weapons trade he was feeding. He becomes Iron Man to balance the scales and take accountability for the part he's played. Steve was always small and frail, getting protected by others, particularly Bucky who Steve views as all the things he wants to be: Strong, selfless, a soldier. So when he gets the power to do so, we see him do just that because the military has become his family and they needed him.  

We don't get to see Cpt. Marvel powerless at all in this movie. We don't spend any time in those scenes they show snippets of that allude to that character development. Like, the scenes of her standing up every time she falls. Those would have been great scenes to show us! Maybe how her Dad never believed in her or she grew up in a town that always told her she couldnt do something because she was a girl. Maybe that's why being a pilot appealed to her,  the slogan ""Higher. Further. Faster."" could have been on a brochure she got in high school or she saw Cpt. Marvel on the news doing something amazing and she wanted to be just like her. Which would have made it even more impactful when she gets to meet and fly with her. We see none of flight school and her overcoming her challenges there...

The problem with superheroes is that you can't relate to them by nature of them being, well, super. The qualities that make them human and the experiences of their life that shapes and drives them are the real substance. They totally bypassed that substance in this movie and it's why it always felt like it's lacking substance. Like I've walked into a series on season 3 and these moments have no weight to me because I've missed the build-up. I don't care that she's OP, I care that in a movie that's supposed to be an origin story, I got no origin. How am I supposed to care for a character that I don't even know?",0.4516288638114929,C

"The filmmakers wanted to make Captain Marvel ""cool"" by having her be a cocky, super-competent hero who rarely loses, because she's just too cool -- it's like they saw Iron Man 1, and were like ""we want her to be cool like Tony Stark"", but absorbed NONE of the nuances of Stark's character, and just made Captain Marvel an asshole. Here's the difference -- Tony Stark is not JUST an asshole, at least not after the first act of Iron Man 1. He starts out as a real jerk, and he suffers for it. A team of American soldiers get blown and shot to pieces, he gets injured, and, in his attempt to escape, Yinsen is killed. Tony Stark's hubris is not a strength, it's a flaw -- it's why he realizes he needs to shut down those terrorists for good, since they were using his weapons. He shuts down the weapons division of Stark Industries. In Iron Man 2, he's still suffering from the mistakes he and his father made. His recklessness with his suit at the party results in Rhodey knocking him around, and then flying off with the Mark 2 because Tony can't be trusted with his own tech. In Iron Man 3, his arrogance results in Killian's forces blowing up his house, nearly killing Pepper and Maya Hansen.

Iron Man's ENTIRE story arc ends in Endgame, where he makes the ultimate non-selfish sacrifice in snapping away Thanos's army, killing himself in the process. Tony's arrogance may have been funny at times when it wasn't resulting in painful consequences for himself and others, but it was something that was seen as a real flaw.

PLANK, on the other hand, is just Iron Man 1 Tony, without any of the character development or deeper moral bedrock. Stark actually did care about the people around him, despite his arrogance -- Plank, however, shows absolutely zero human empathy. She gets a bit sad with her ""friend"", and is kinda sad about the poor, terrorized Skrulls, but overall, she just had zero empathy, and just walked around blasting shit.",0.18267080187797546,C

"For me this was one of the most interesting conversations i've ever seen on you tube.

I feel so blessed to hear Jonathan's careful and wise answers, but also so very grateful to see this process happening in the public square.    I know so many previously atheist sorts who are reconsidering what they thought they knew of God and of Jesus, and these kind of nuanced and careful conversations are speaking to what I think is a huge transformation taking place in our society.

I think of it like this:  our scientific ancestors rejected the version of Christianity they had inherited because it was not coherent with their new understanding of natural processes.   But now we, as their descendants, having experienced a secular world they couldn't have imagined, are realising that something of immense value was lost in that process and are beginning the process of reconciling the past with the present.

"I understand Elijah's struggle with being a Christian living in a sin-filled world. It's very hard at times and it feels like you are wading through an endless sea of turmoil. But I always try to remember that Jesus calms the storms in our lives and gives us clarity. These people are still people trying to find a place to belong in a country that doesn't actually care about their bodies or mental state, but this country encourages people to act on their most selfish desires. This isn't a surprise, for the bible tells about this. So as a Christian we have to take every day in stride, read our Bible, fast and pray.

Hi there. This'll be the last video for a few weeks. Vaush and I had a lovely discussion yesterday on our concepts of reform and revolution, their place in current organizing, the issues of social-democracy and labour aristocracy, leftist aesthetics and more. Although generally a surface discussion, I believe it was fruitful and beneficial for those involved. I hope you think so as well, and who knows, maybe we'll do another in the future. Lemme know what you think. Love you all!
Special thanks to Alex Bookbinder for recording the segment and sending it my way. Thanks habibi <3

"I only found your channel yesterday after seeing you mentioned in Vaush‚Äôs tweet saying he was having a debate with you (I‚Äôm subbed to his channel but must have missed the other episodes you were on).  So of course I searched you on YT, watched a few vids (adored the Ben Shapiro one) and you‚Äôve earned yourself a subscriber.  

I‚Äôm a 53 year old socialist, and dismayed to watch so many of my left leaning friends of my younger days become financially successful (which is fine if that‚Äôs a goal of yours) and lose the ideals that connected us.  These days I connect mostly by watching and interacting on leftist YouTube, which is mainly people my oldest son‚Äôs age.  I‚Äôm proud of your generation   I‚Äôm excited by your passion and dedication.   Keep doing what you do.

"I gotta say, while I have never been a fan of Vaush, this is the most rational explanation by Vaush of his beliefs that I have seen to date.  If this continues, I could easily see myself coming around regarding him.  Honestly, I think Hakim's abilities to build bridges and dig deep to base understandings of shared root beliefs, really brings out the best in Vaush.

One must be humble before the facts.

Fry's mind & life encompass so much of authentic humanity, and as the years go on, he becomes even more compassionate and mellow. He is a magnificent human being.

"The worst one for me is when you're at a social event, say on a night out with people from work, and you get on with pretty much everyone there and no one is consciously or purposefully trying to exclude you , but there's a point where you look around and realise all the others are off in their own little groups chatting and you're just sat there. Then if you do try and go to one of the groups to join in you feel like you're intruding or putting yourself where you don't belong.

No one ever acts like you don't belong but you've convinced yourself you don't. That kind of loneliness is horrible because I know it's only in my mind but you still feel cut-off even though you're not.",0.4838278889656067,L

"I often get lonely when I see other people (online and offline) having fun with their friends, interacting socially or whatever, and I find it very hard to differenciate whether that is actual loneliness or if I just feel like I need to have (as many) friends/relationships as others to fit in. I recently moved to a new city for university and it seems like everyone has found their little groups except for me. It's really hard for me to be open to new relationships because many of my past friendships were extremely one-sided which made me feel worthless. I also have anxiety and depression, so that's not helping either. 
Thank you for talking about this. I feel so ashamed admitting that I'm lonely. I'll often tell people that I've made new friends here because I feel too ashamed to admit I'm spending my time alone more than I'd like. I'm an introvert, so being alone is amazing and great, but like you said, it only is fullfilling if you socially interact with other people.
You're my hero for taking steps to connect with people! That's so brave and amazing!",0.9510666131973267,L
"ADHD person here. I've always found it extremely difficult to maintain or even establish lasting friendships. For some reason other people just don't seem as interested in making a good friend as I am.¬†It's weird. 

I'm terrified of being lonely. It's the worst thing I can imagine. I'm extremely lucky in that I met my soon-to-be wife at a friend's party nearly ten years ago now. But every night I have horrible nightmares about her leaving me, forgetting me, growing indifferent to staying in contact with me. This is the literal opposite of our relationship - we are, so far as I can tell, irritatingly happy, and have been since we met. But man, that fear of being alone in life just never lets up. I'm equally terrified of anyone I love, or even remotely consider, of being alone and lonely.

I've maintained for a long time now that the single biggest threat to mental health is widespread loneliness. I blame internet culture. I blame an outdated education system which prioritises neurotypical people and punishes and shames those who are different or who struggle with one method of teaching. I blame a society which places greater importance on the glorification of the self and not of the health of the local community. I blame companies and corporations which take everything from poor communities and give nothing back, neither to their staff or needy customers. I blame a government which actively HATES people with disabilities or mental health problems, addicts and the homeless.

"I've never seen someone else talk about the feeling of having to give up parts of yourself in order to be able to relate to people more. I'm totally with you there, ahh

I've always had a habit of burying myself deep in my passions, to the point where I don't really think of much else. I'm quite happy spending days at a time alone, working on little personal projects. But it's left me basically unable to talk to others about much other than my niche interests without intense anxiety, or feeling the same way I do about speaking infront of a crowd.

It sucks a lot, but I value the passion I have for art and writing a lot as well. It's left me stumped, to be honest. I feel like I need to find a way to strike a balance that doesn't end up isolating me, but at the same time I love working on stuff like that!!

"My problem with loneliness is that I've convinced myself that I can't belong anywhere. When I was younger I felt so different from the world around me, nobody was like me and after years of this I was ""came to terms"" that something about me was just broken. I habe since found out that I have adhd, am gender fluid and queer, so that was at least a big part of the reason why I felt like I didn't belong. I still feel lonely because I feel like I can't connect properly with other people because they aren't like me. I recently made friends with two incredible people who make me feel like I belong and I'll have to admit, it's weird. I'm getting used to having people around me where I feel like I can talk to them. Loneliness is still a big problem for me but I think I'll be ok.",0.9682263135910034,L
"I think my personal observation of loneliness, a study many years in the making is that few people talk about how addictive isolation is. Most people i think understand the negative aspects of loneliness to various degrees but many of those accounts assume an extroverted mindset. For an introvert like me isolation can be a wonderful thing. I can do what i want, when i want for as long as i want without interference or expectation from others. Not going out is a massive money saver, not having social engagements means you have so much free time. Having an extended period of isolation allowed me to delve into my own mind and discover several things about myself i never knew. And above everything isolation is easy. It takes almost no effort and for someone who often lacks mental energy it's so damn tempting. And any time i think about reaching out, trying to make new friends or even get back into dating all i can think of is how much effort it will be, how much it will cost in time and money and the potential risks. I am lonely and part of me understands that like a chemical addiction isolation is slowly killing me while telling me how much i need it. But just can't seem to shake it.",0.7638747096061707,L
"One instance of loneliness that I recall so vividly was soon after my dog passed away. I had to attend a birthday party (it hadn't even been a week since my dog passed away) and everyone who'd spoken to me knew about my dog, they'd even knew my dog, and yet still wanted me to be all smiles and sociable. Cheerful, not depressed. I'd felt so lonely and hurt. In order for people to back off and quit expecting me to be happy, my parents told them that I hadn't been feeling well (oh the days you could get away with that excuse).",0.1854003220796585,L
"You touched on my favourite loneliness remedy in the beginning. I'm one of those people that used to feel extremely lonely and depressed most of the time and was fixated on my own traumas and negative events in my life. I thought those traumas made me unique and that no one could ever understand me and that I would be alone forever. When I realized that trauma is not unique and that it made me like a great many other people it helped me expand my worldview and connect with others. Reducing and work on that selfishness in myself has been my main remedy towards the loneliness and, while it's not entirely gone, it's so much more manageable now.",0.9835969805717468,L
"Loneliness is definitely something I have dealt with. Throughout university, I got along with every person I met student wise, lecturers was a different story, but I was only ever chummy with them, I never felt like I had made a friend. I went on to live on my own in second year thinking I'd be okay, I enjoy my own company normally and thought I'll be at uni for a couple of hours a day, couple hours in group projects, and then a bit of socialising/online gaming with my school friends in the evening. I have never been more lonely. I felt invisible, like no one would notice if I wasn't there, even though I think people got along with me too. Surface level friendships are nice don't get me wrong, but when I can talk to my school friends and be myself, make my stupid jokes, talk about my mental/physical health with them, it's night and day the difference. I struggle to trust people I haven't got strong relationships with, but I can't make those strong relationships anymore as I feel I need to trust them to make it. I'm terrified I'm going to lose my friends soon as they all move out of their family houses, get full time jobs etc. And my family just make me feel lonely too. They don't believe in mental health issues so I just have to sit there struggling but trying my best not to show it, which luckily as a mentally ill young chap I'm pretty used to and have gotten pretty good at haha. I just bottle it up, mentally break twice a year or so and start over tbh (BUT I STRESS, do NOT do this, its really bad for you, I am aware.

"I appreciate the notion that being a parent doesn't cure loneliness. In fact, my first months of motherhood were the loneliest time of my life.

Not everyone has the propensity to push paper or use their voice as their money maker.

"Just watching this in the background as I clean my apartment and when she said ""people in the chronically online left"", I honestly cracked up. Mostly because from my perspective, all of this is all too chronically online. Most of this sounds petty and unproductive on the grand scheme of things. These are discussions that i feel don't really need to happen publicly. But maybe it's my age and my disinterest in streaming culture. I don't exactly get how people have these conversations and then believe them to be important. 

""Political hobbyist"" is a really hilarious term to me because that's how I view the vast majority of people who have these conversations over stream, for an audience. It all comes off as so deeply privilege and short sighted. I'm sorry, but she's quite literally describing the things she involves herself in. The people most oppressed by things like transphobia aren't watching these streams and do not care about your debate with a random streamer who insulted your ego. As you say, these debates are inherently performative and not interested in shifting change. It's certainly possible, but most people who show up to watch two streamers debate are rooting for them, as she correctly describes, like sports teams.

"trans fem here whose on progesterone. I tried soo hard to find any evidence for it before i started but there are just zero good studies. But within a few weeks my tits started growing and my nipples especially went from looking pretty much how they had before estrogen to large and feminine within a couple months. Also dramatically improved my mood and overall energy, increased my sex drive, and made my skin and hair look soo much nicer. If you can get it try it. Some people cant tolerate it from the anecdotes Ive heard but its worth trying.

If we listened to the science without question then we would have told binary trans folks in the 90s that they shouldn't question being required to be sterilized before starting HRT. And we would have told enbys that they scientifically cant be trans without dysphoria. Without brave and determined trans folks challenging the scientific consensus we would still be in the dark ages.",0.9161071181297302,L
I definitely have beef with RGR for all the reasons you stated here but I do gotta say I find it simultaneously annoying and endearing that she treats *everything* like a legal proceeding. drafting a list of highly specific terms for a follow from you? fantastic. Asking kalvin garrah a series of pointed questions on record to clear his name? so extra. How incredibly law school of her.,0.5352633595466614,L
"Riley just radiates insecurity vibes, IMO. Like the way that she communicates to her community and other creators through documents that are formatted like legal briefs (complete with emblems, headers, line numbering, jargon language, and bulleted lists) just comes across as though she is a law student who is desperately trying to look ""official"" or ""intelligent"". It reminds me of when I used to go around dropping psychology terms in casual conversation with friends to sound smart when I was in psych 101.",0.3159298002719879,L
"I really think Riley has a similar issue to Blaire White where she can‚Äôt negotiate her trans ness with how she wants to be seen. She views herself as super logical and not emotional and her stances on trans issues reflect that. She isn‚Äôt supportive of self ID, neopronouns or ‚Äúchoosing‚Äù to be trans because then being trans isn‚Äôt just a medical or brain affliction, it‚Äôs something emotional that maybe we just can‚Äôt explain. When she comes at other trans people she is so unsympathetic and tries to ignore their feelings and focus on being rational because she isn‚Äôt comfortable with queer people who don‚Äôt justify themselves with a stack of references. She‚Äôs like Blaire because she wants so badly to distance herself from trans people she find unacceptable. DemonMama is right, RGR isn‚Äôt comfortable being trans because she can‚Äôt truly explain or argue it and so she‚Äôs hyper logical and conservative on trans issues compared to most of the left, she is trying to make up for the fact that she can‚Äôt negotiate how her identity challenges her own worldview.",0.5161162614822388,L
"Honestly i wouldn't consider someone who engaged in friendly conversation with someone like Kalvin my ally either even they were attempting to ""educate"" him.

I DO want him removed from this space. There are some things you can't come back from and years of relentless bullying is one of them. I don't feel safe around Kalvin as a nonbinary person and i never will and a lot of people share that sentiment. This isn't a ""disagreement"" that needs resolving this is a man who lead years of targeted harassment toward specific trans creators.

Until that man deletes every video on his channel, denounces the terrible things he said without being coached, and gives apologies to his victims specifically, i could give a frog's fat ass if he says nonbinary people are valid.

If she wanted at all to sound like she was being even a little introspective without actually making amends with any particular people, that was a super easy one to walk back and doing so could make her seem significantly less insane, at least to some people. But, instead, she abandoned the idea of explaining herself or her positions entirely, in favor of maintaining a smug ""I'm always the flawlessly logical one"" attitude.

"Bravo, thank you for your wonderful presentation. I just wish that some of the less informed members of society could watch this video. I get very tired of hearing those in the US thinking and believing that Communism and Socialism are one and the same, far from it, and that those who espouse ""socialist"", or ""left wing views are all tarred with the same feather. We also experience it in my country, New Zealand. Our current government is a ""left wing"", perhaps socialist leaning, or maybe has a strange mix of socialist and capitalist doctrine. The difficulty is that there are those who think that any form of government intervention is, ""socialism"", and communism, and bitterly complain and moan, and think that we are living under a communist r√©gime. These people wouldn't have a clue what living under a communist regime is like. Long story short, if the government seem heavy handed, or interfering in peoples' lives if certain people don't like a certain thing, they label it as ""socialist"", and ""communist"". A recent example is the government encouraging as many as possible to get vaccinated against Covid 19. They also set a stringent set of rules and regulations, that possible impinged on some of our freedoms, many people opposed the stringent conditions, and labelled the government as communist.

"Thanks azureScapegoat!  This video has been very helpful.  I'm trying to hone in on a new definition of ""Profit"" because I think redefining it is the only way to rescue our Environment.
Profit = our gratefulness and loving care, for our Environment and for the substance that it provides to all of us.  Does this put me in the category of capitalist, socialist or communist?
With our present mis-interpretation of Profit, switching from one technology to another will cause much more damage to the Environment.  If we redefine Profit by acknowledging that
our real Profit is our Environment, then we may become able to feed from our Environment in a more caring, thoughtful way.  Our real Profit is starving because we don't feed it, but
with this kind of definition of Profit, maybe we can work, caring for the Environment, into our conduction of business without treating that as an unacceptable expense.  Substance is provided
to virtually all of us because all of us will work.  Nature paid us in advance and now we work to make the Environment robust, i.e., to protect and increase our Profit.  Thanks again. üëç

Explain the Socialism the way it is, then capitalism, then break down socialism the way it is, and then break down capitalism so we can have a really good comparison - I think that MIGHT help make the concept more understandable rather than leaving out a major chuck.

She is grappling with trying to improve her mental health and finding healthy ways to ease her crippling depression while also being a performer and dealing with her adoring fans that shower her in love which can de-rail the healing process as it is an extremely potent but temporary high that leaves you empty when the curtains close. Truly healing is hard work, it is tempting to just bask in the artificial love of our parasocial relationship with her but just like drugs, its a cycle and the high is never as good as the last so you keep chasing that first high, practice poses you've performed a million times, you're a puppet on a string going through the motions. The solution? Love me more audience! MAYBE if you love me more it will be enough to drown the emptiness out.

To keep yourself from wanting to die, you start to give yourself something tangible to live for, like an event you want to go to, a goal to achieve, etc. This unhealthy cycle repeats, once that event has passed or that goal is reached, you have this need to find something else to live towards, because without it, you can't give yourself the need to live. Eventually, there are no more goals to strive for and nothing new you want to do, you've done everything that is worthy enough to give you the reason to live. That is when you move onto people. Having someone as your reason to be alive is so incredibly damaging to both parties, not just yourself anymore. ""I need you to love me more"" suggests that this is person is your romantic partner, of course, but how the chorus continues illustrates how burdening it can be to have a persons love be why you live. The repetitiveness of the lyrics along with the seemingly chaotic piano and increasing tempo gives this anxiety and urgency to the listener, much like how you'd feel if this person does not love you more and more and more then you'll lose your reason to live and you'll be left with nothing.",0.39741507172584534,L

"The Lyrics <3

If I keep myself at home
I won't make the same mistake
That I made for fifteen years
I could be a new girl
I will be a new girl
I wish that this would go away
But when I'm done singing this song
I will have to find something else
To do to keep me here
Something else to keep me
Here's my hand
There's the itch
But I'm not supposed to scratch
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out
How do other people live?
I wonder how they keep it up
When today is finally done
There's another day to come
Then another day to come
Then another day to come back to mine
We'll pretend it ends tomorrow
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more

"I deeply appreciate her music so much, her music is heart wrenching and so powerful. She shows desperation and her  storytelling and portrayal of the emotions is godly. Mitski truly is an artist. She‚Äôs extremely talented and just an overall interesting person. It must be so emotionally tiring to write these songs at such high demand, i‚Äôm glad she took a break. Mitski‚Äôs work is like reading a book, with all the  details of one. Its sad how ppl have killed said  detail with her work. Shes been narrowed down to another female artist who just write relatable and sad music. That stereotype alone is harmful. They water down the fuck out of her music. Strawberry blonde and other songs about WOC are the prime example. I guess my only critic is the audience she‚Äôs been granted with. The way people describe her is so dehumanizing and just awful, she‚Äôs a person, just like the all of you. she has become a personality trait, her ethnicity and experiences boiled down to what other people can take from it.
Honestly it‚Äôs so disrespectful to her work and her as a person when people minimize her work to ‚Äúomg mitski = quirky and sad ü§™ü§™ü§™‚Äù SHE IS AN AMAZING artist despite all this. I admire her so so much.",0.8803855776786804,L

On the other, it‚Äôs about needing to love yourself more.

I have been in the woods or open field in subzero tempatures for 8-12 hours at a time when working or hunting I will survive with or without a grocery store and dont need oil industry either.

This universe is full of things,  which don't have a rational explanation. Why not open our minds a little bit more and accept a fact that we don't and can't know everything.

The only time I'm talkative is when I want to share something I'm passionate about and to someone I know very well or get along with very well. One major thing in astrology relationships is finding some sort of compliment sign to be coupled with, as a few people know, Sagittarius is the opposite sign. I'm currently dating a Sagittarius and have been for over three years, despite some sources saying that the two signs are incompatible and would only cause war. But in reality, there's just so many other reasons that are not astrology as to why we do great together. I try to live my life as it goes and I don't adhere to what astrology has to say even though its coincidences are interesting when it comes to the way we communicate with others.",0.9357384443283081,L

I didn‚Äôt feel scared or even shocked. I was so overwhelmed with the awesome glowing power of pure energy they were formed off. I told them how beautiful they were and I turned my head to call my partner they vanished. What I witnessed helped me to understand that we exist in a multidimensional universe on multidimensional levels of conscious realities.I believe we are all souls having a human experience.
