## Introduction
Welcome to the repo containing the work for both my individual research project for the Comp 396 course and its extension which will appear as "Chapter 4: Analysis of the impact of algorithms in siloing users: special focus on YouTube" of the upcoming book "AI & Society: Tensions and Opportunities" CRC Press Taylor & Francis Group co-authored by myself (Mika Desblancs) and Joseph Vybihal, Faculty Lecturer at McGill University ([personal website](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jvybihal/index.php)).

## Repository Organization
For my Comp 396 project (Undergraduate Research Project Course): 
- the Final Report can be found in the "\Comp 396 Final Report.[pdf/docx]"([here](https://github.com/mika-jpd/YouTube_Radicalization_Recommendations/blob/master/Comp%20396%20Research%20Project/Comp%20396%20Final%20Report.pdf)),
- the Jupyter notebook with data used in the report can be found at "Comp 396 Research Project\Tree Analysys of YouTube Scraper.ipynb" ([here](https://github.com/mika-jpd/YouTube_Radicalization_Recommendations/blob/master/Comp%20396%20Research%20Project/Tree%20Analysys%20of%20YouTube%20Scraper.ipynb))
- the webscraper code used can be found at "\Comp 396 Research Project\YouTubeScraper.py" ([here](https://github.com/mika-jpd/YouTube_Radicalization_Recommendations/blob/master/Comp%20396%20Research%20Project/YouTubeScraper.py))
- the related YouTube webscrape data in "\Comp 396 Research Project\Project_data\" ([here](https://github.com/mika-jpd/YouTube_Radicalization_Recommendations/tree/master/Comp%20396%20Research%20Project/Project_data))
    - the first section called "Tree_Results (Left-Wing)" contains the data for webscrapes whose root video is a left-wing video
    - the second section called "Tree_Results (Right-Wing)" contains the data for webscrapes whose root video is a right-wing video

For the chapter data, all the relevant data and graphs are in "\YouTube Content Silos Research":
- the notebook with relevant analysis can be found in "YouTube Content Silos\Analysis of all experiments.ipynb"
- the data for the different scrapes can be found in "YouTube Content Silos\[Depth, Breadth, Survey]" folders

(*Note: As the Chapter content is propery of CRC Press Taylor & Francis Group, I am not able to include it in the repository. I will update the repo with a link for purchase once it is available for purchase.*)
