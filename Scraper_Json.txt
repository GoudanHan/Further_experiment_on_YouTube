Professor Sandel asks students whether they consider this policy just.  Many do not, arguing that it is unfair to allow the affluent to avoid serving and risking their lives by paying less privileged citizens to fight in their place. This leads to a classroom debate about war and conscription.  Is todays voluntary army open to the same objection?  Should military service be allocated by the labor market or by conscription?  What role should patriotism play, and what are the obligations of citizenship?  Is there a civic duty to serve ones country? And are utilitarians and libertarians able to account for this duty?\n\nPART TWO:  MOTHERHOOD: FOR SALE\n\nIn this lecture, Professor Sandel examines the principle of free-market exchange in light of the contemporary controversy over reproductive rights.  Sandel begins with a humorous discussion of the business of egg and sperm donation.  He then describes the case of Baby M\"\u2014a famous legal battle in the mid-eighties that raised the unsettling question, Who owns a baby?\" In 1985, a woman named Mary Beth Whitehead signed a contract with a New Jersey couple, agreeing to be a surrogate mother in exchange for a fee of $10,000.  However, after giving birth, Ms. Whitehead decided she wanted to keep the child, and the case went to court. Sandel and students debate the nature of informed consent, the morality of selling a human life, and the meaning of maternal rights.",

Sandel presents some contemporary cases in which cost-benefit analysis was used to put a dollar value on human life. The cases give rise to several objections to the utilitarian logic of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number. Should we always give more weight to the happiness of a majority, even if the majority is cruel or ignoble? Is it possible to sum up and compare all values using a common measure like money?\n\nPART TWO: HOW TO MEASURE PLEASURE\n\nSandel introduces J.S. Mill, a utilitarian philosopher who attempts to defend utilitarianism against the objections raised by critics of the doctrine. Mill argues that seeking the greatest good for the greatest number is compatible with protecting individual rights, and that utilitarianism can make room for a distinction between higher and lower pleasures. Mills idea is that the higher pleasure is always the pleasure preferred by a well-informed majority. Sandel tests this theory by playing video clips from three very different forms of entertainment: Shakespeares Hamlet, the reality show Fear Factor, and The Simpsons. Students debate which experience provides the higher pleasure, and whether Mills defense of utilitarianism is successful.",

Libertarians argue that government shouldnt have the power to enact laws that 1) protect people from themselves, such as seat belt laws, 2) impose some peoples moral values on society as a whole, or 3) redistribute income from the rich to the poor. Sandel explains the libertarian notion that redistributive taxation is akin to forced labor with references to Bill Gates and Michael Jordan. \n\nPART TWO:  WHO OWNS ME?\n\nLibertarian philosopher Robert Nozick makes the case that taxing the wealthy\u2014to pay for housing, health care, and education for the poor\u2014is a form of coercion.  Students first discuss the arguments behind redistributive taxation. Dont most poor people need the social services they receive in order to survive?  If you live in a society that has a system of progressive taxation, arent you obligated to pay your taxes?  Dont many rich people often acquire their wealth through sheer luck or family fortune?  A group of students dubbed Team Libertarian volunteers to defend the libertarian philosophy against these objections.",

Sandel presents some contemporary cases in which cost-benefit analysis was used to put a dollar value on human life. The cases give rise to several objections to the utilitarian logic of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number. Should we always give more weight to the happiness of a majority, even if the majority is cruel or ignoble? Is it possible to sum up and compare all values using a common measure like money?\n\nPART TWO: HOW TO MEASURE PLEASURE\n\nSandel introduces J.S. Mill, a utilitarian philosopher who attempts to defend utilitarianism against the objections raised by critics of the doctrine. Mill argues that seeking the greatest good for the greatest number is compatible with protecting individual rights, and that utilitarianism can make room for a distinction between higher and lower pleasures. Mills idea is that the higher pleasure is always the pleasure preferred by a well-informed majority. Sandel tests this theory by playing video clips from three very different forms of entertainment: Shakespeares Hamlet, the reality show Fear Factor, and The Simpsons. Students debate which experience provides the higher pleasure, and whether Mills defense of utilitarianism is successful.",

Professor Sandel asks students whether they consider this policy just.  Many do not, arguing that it is unfair to allow the affluent to avoid serving and risking their lives by paying less privileged citizens to fight in their place. This leads to a classroom debate about war and conscription.  Is todays voluntary army open to the same objection?  Should military service be allocated by the labor market or by conscription?  What role should patriotism play, and what are the obligations of citizenship?  Is there a civic duty to serve ones country? And are utilitarians and libertarians able to account for this duty?\n\nPART TWO:  MOTHERHOOD: FOR SALE\n\nIn this lecture, Professor Sandel examines the principle of free-market exchange in light of the contemporary controversy over reproductive rights.  Sandel begins with a humorous discussion of the business of egg and sperm donation.  He then describes the case of Baby M\"\u2014a famous legal battle in the mid-eighties that raised the unsettling question, Who owns a baby?\" In 1985, a woman named Mary Beth Whitehead signed a contract with a New Jersey couple, agreeing to be a surrogate mother in exchange for a fee of $10,000.  However, after giving birth, Ms. Whitehead decided she wanted to keep the child, and the case went to court. Sandel and students debate the nature of informed consent, the morality of selling a human life, and the meaning of maternal rights.",

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.\n\nOne percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country\u2019s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. \"Manager Magazin\u201d says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary \"Top of the World\" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as a self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

As the new powers - China and India from Asia and others from Africa and Latin America - rise to the top of the world's pecking order, how should the West react? Kishore Mahbubani argues passionately and provocatively that the West can no longer impose its power and ideals on the world at large, and - paradoxically - that only by admitting its decline can the West set itself up for strategic success in the long term. Mahbubani examines the myths and self-delusions of Western power with an outsider's critical eye, and the shocking freshness of his geopolitical analysis will give all Westerners and political thinkers pause for thought.\n\n================================================\nProf Kishore Mahbubani is Senior Advisor (University & Global Relations) and Professor in the Practice of Policy National University of Singapore. He is also the founding Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n\nThis event is moderated by Prof. Danny Quah, Dean and Li Ka Shing Professor in Economics at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.\n\n================================================\n\nVisit us \nWebsite: ",

Far from fated by the alliance system or the arms race, the war of 1914 was an eminently avoidable catastrophe brought on by the opportunistic scheming by a small handful of statesmen, often driven as much by personal complexes and rivalries as by compelling reasons of state. Though aware, in some sense, of the risks they were running, none of the men responsible could have imagined the scale of the human catastrophe they were about to unleash.\n\nPresented November 7, 2014 as part of the National World War I Museum and United States World War I Centennial Commission 2014 Symposium, \"1914: Global War & American Neutrality.\" \n\nThe Symposium was held in association with The Western Front Association East Coast Branch and the World War I Historical Association.

He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance and wants to step in. But can this really ease inequality?\n\nChristoph Gr\u00f6ner does everything he can to drum up donations and convince the wealthy auction guests to raise their bids. The more the luxury watch for sale fetches, the more money there will be to pay for a new football field, or some extra tutoring, at a children's home. Christoph Gr\u00f6ner is one of the richest people in Germany - his company is now worth one billion euros, he tells us. For seven months, he let our cameras follow him - into board meetings, onto construction sites, through his daily life, and in his charity work. He knows that someone like him is an absolute exception in Germany. His parents were both teachers, and he still worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance. \"What we see here is total failure across the board,\u201d he says. \"It starts with parents who just don\u2019t get it and can\u2019t do anything right. And then there\u2019s an education policy that has opened the gates wide to the chaos we are experiencing today.\" Chistoph Gr\u00f6ner wants to step in where state institutions have failed. But can that really ease inequality? \n\nIn Germany, getting ahead depends more on where you come from than in most other industrialized countries, and social mobility is normally quite restricted. Those on top stay on top. The same goes for those at the bottom. A new study shows that Germany\u2019s rich and poor both increasingly stay amongst themselves, without ever intermingling with other social strata. Even the middle class is buckling under the mounting pressure of an unsecure future. \"Land of Inequality\" searches for answers as to why. We talk to families, an underpaid nurse, as well as leading researchers and analysts such as economic Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, sociologist Jutta Allmendinger or the economist Raj Chetty, who conducted a Stanford investigation into how the middle class is now arming itself to improve their children\u2019s outlooks.\n\nPart 1: ",

And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.\n\nOne percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country\u2019s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. \"Manager Magazin\u201d says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary \"Top of the World\" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as a self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Within a decade, the share of urban dwellers is expected to increase to 75 percent. Construction is booming and competition for residential land is fierce.\n\nBut the right to live in a city in China is conditional. Authorities want their modern cities to be peopled with well-educated, highly-qualified or politically well-connected residents. As a result, certain standards have to be met to be eligible for a modern, urban home. Only members of China's political classes and the financially successful have a hope of qualifying. Yet more than half of the people who live in cities are so-called \"migrant workers.\" They come from rural communities and have no official rights to settle in cities. They are there to work. With no proper rights, they are merely tolerated while they serve as merchants, servants, waitstaff, cleaners, construction workers and tradespeople. But while they are indispensable to daily life in the cities, they are unable to afford their exorbitant rents. This documentary looks at how and where these workers live, and asks whether middle and working class Chinese even figure in the official vision of shiny, high-tech cities. The filmmakers also look at what happens to those who oppose official plans, or stand in the way of the building boom.",

The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind. \n\nFor the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gr\u00f6ner, one of Germany\u2019s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. \"If you have great wealth, you can\u2019t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts. \"Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we\u2019re more independent,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanovi\u0107, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. \"These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,\" Milanovi\u0107 notes. \"Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?\u201d\n\nPart 1: ",

He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance and wants to step in. But can this really ease inequality?\n\nChristoph Gr\u00f6ner does everything he can to drum up donations and convince the wealthy auction guests to raise their bids. The more the luxury watch for sale fetches, the more money there will be to pay for a new football field, or some extra tutoring, at a children's home. Christoph Gr\u00f6ner is one of the richest people in Germany - his company is now worth one billion euros, he tells us. For seven months, he let our cameras follow him - into board meetings, onto construction sites, through his daily life, and in his charity work. He knows that someone like him is an absolute exception in Germany. His parents were both teachers, and he still worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance. \"What we see here is total failure across the board,\u201d he says. \"It starts with parents who just don\u2019t get it and can\u2019t do anything right. And then there\u2019s an education policy that has opened the gates wide to the chaos we are experiencing today.\" Chistoph Gr\u00f6ner wants to step in where state institutions have failed. But can that really ease inequality? \n\nIn Germany, getting ahead depends more on where you come from than in most other industrialized countries, and social mobility is normally quite restricted. Those on top stay on top. The same goes for those at the bottom. A new study shows that Germany\u2019s rich and poor both increasingly stay amongst themselves, without ever intermingling with other social strata. Even the middle class is buckling under the mounting pressure of an unsecure future. \"Land of Inequality\" searches for answers as to why. We talk to families, an underpaid nurse, as well as leading researchers and analysts such as economic Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, sociologist Jutta Allmendinger or the economist Raj Chetty, who conducted a Stanford investigation into how the middle class is now arming itself to improve their children\u2019s outlooks.\n\nPart 1: ",

Within a decade, the share of urban dwellers is expected to increase to 75 percent. Construction is booming and competition for residential land is fierce.\n\nBut the right to live in a city in China is conditional. Authorities want their modern cities to be peopled with well-educated, highly-qualified or politically well-connected residents. As a result, certain standards have to be met to be eligible for a modern, urban home. Only members of China's political classes and the financially successful have a hope of qualifying. Yet more than half of the people who live in cities are so-called \"migrant workers.\" They come from rural communities and have no official rights to settle in cities. They are there to work. With no proper rights, they are merely tolerated while they serve as merchants, servants, waitstaff, cleaners, construction workers and tradespeople. But while they are indispensable to daily life in the cities, they are unable to afford their exorbitant rents. This documentary looks at how and where these workers live, and asks whether middle and working class Chinese even figure in the official vision of shiny, high-tech cities. The filmmakers also look at what happens to those who oppose official plans, or stand in the way of the building boom.",

And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.\n\nOne percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country\u2019s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. \"Manager Magazin\u201d says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary \"Top of the World\" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as a self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind. \n\nFor the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gr\u00f6ner, one of Germany\u2019s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. \"If you have great wealth, you can\u2019t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts. \"Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we\u2019re more independent,\u201d Gr\u00f6ner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanovi\u0107, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. \"These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,\" Milanovi\u0107 notes. \"Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?\u201d\n\nPart 1: ",

Among them: How do we characterize the contemporary state of the American education system? What happens to the quality of education when public universities become more privatized? Are public universities in danger of being converted into facilities that produce graduates-as-commodities for the job market? What is the role of activism in education? With unprecedented tuition increases and budget struggles occurring across American campuses, these are questions that are more relevant than ever.",

And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.\n\nOne percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country\u2019s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. \"Manager Magazin\u201d says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary \"Top of the World\" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as a self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

                "description": "Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market \u2013 the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? \n\nFor years, the world\u2019s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.\n\nThe fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it\u2019s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: \"This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more.\" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it\u2019s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It\u2019s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates.\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

These questions are the subject of the film \"Land of Inequality - Power.\u201d \n\nMany studies show that a small but wealthy part of society defines a country\u2019s political direction. It\u2019s the same all over the world. German researchers evaluated hundreds of opinion polls on the topics of the economy, environment, foreign policy and finance. They then examined what poor people wanted from politics on these issues - and what the rich did. The differences were clear: \"An obvious example is taxes on property,\u201d says Armin Sch\u00e4fer, a political scientist at the University of Munster. \"Higher income groups are more skeptical about any reintroduction of a property tax, whereas lower income groups definitely want it. So far, we have not reintroduced a property tax in that form.\u201d So who gets to decide what Germany looks like? To find out, our film follows building contractor Christoph Gr\u00f6ner, who has made millions from the construction business. Gr\u00f6ner wants to build an entire new district in Cologne, which is facing a severe housing shortfall and where rents are soaring and the poor in particular feel ignored. But he has faced delays in getting building permits. Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker says: \"It is a city\u2019s job to provide land and grant building permits.\u201d But can\u2019t it do that faster? Gr\u00f6ner says the politicians should take their foot off the brakes. To show how much power money really wields, we go to the places where politics and economics come together - to the district town halls and the VIP box at a Bundesliga stadium. And to Europe's largest real estate show in Cannes, where billionaire investors use their financial clout to shape cities and regions as they wish.\n\nPart 1: ",

And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.\n\nOne percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country\u2019s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. \"Manager Magazin\u201d says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary \"Top of the World\" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as a self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "description": "Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market \u2013 the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? \n\nFor years, the world\u2019s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.\n\nThe fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it\u2019s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: \"This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more.\" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it\u2019s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It\u2019s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates.\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.\n\nOne percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country\u2019s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. \"Manager Magazin\u201d says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary \"Top of the World\" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as a self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Big names include Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and electric vehicle companies Lucid Motors, ElectraMeccanica, Nikola and Atlis Motor Vehicles.\n\nIn 2020, Phoenix attracted more residents than any other U.S. city for the fourth year in a row, as highly skilled remote workers flocked to the lower cost of living and wide open spaces of the Grand Canyon State. \n\nWatch the video to hear from Gov.

And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.\n\nOne percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country\u2019s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. \"Manager Magazin\u201d says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary \"Top of the World\" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as a self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This documentary style video show the life of Mangaka from morning until the evening at the mangaka workplace, home and general mangaka working schedule.  Working in Japan and Tokyo life is unique in itself, but even more unique for a Manga artist creating manga in Tokyo Japan.  Mangaka illustrate manga commonly known as comic book.  Maybe in Western societies, Mangaka are referred to as cartoonist or comic book illustrators.  Manga creators in Japan with rensai status work with publishers to produce weekly manga. This Manga artist day in the life follows Reiji Miyajima \u5bae\u5cf6\u793c\u540f , who lives in Tokyo Japan and creates the manga Kanajo okarishimasu \u5f7c\u5973\u304a\u501f\u308a\u3057\u307e\u3059 which translates to Rent a Girlfriend.  Mangaka working in Japan often work in their home and set aside office space for them and their assistants.  In fact, we also get a look into Mangaka Assistant life as well as how manga is created.  Many Manga Creators work on serial comic books with weekly deadlines, meaning that each day of the work week in Japan is different as the manga creation process has to produce 1 new manga per week.  Manga artist must not only know how to draw and create manga, but they also must know how to manage manga assistants.  We even touch on Mangaka salary for first time manga creators.  An inside look on how manga and comic books are made in Japan.  \n\nWatch more Japan Day in the Life Series (Playlist):\n- ",

In Japan, there\u2019s a unique hospitality custom called OMOTENASHI. Directly translated, Omote meaning public face and nashi meaning nothing, combined it means services are always completely genuine and honest.  Because it\u2019s so deeply rooted in Japanese culture, the staff make extra efforts to provide guests with the best experience possible without expecting anything in return.  We follow Yohei's work day in Tokyo from morning until evening .Yohei works as the assistant manager at APA hotel Shinjuku Gyoenmae.  APA is one of the largest hotel chains in japan.  APA hotel uniquely identify as a New Urban style hotel high Quality, High Functionally without all the unnecessary services providing all guests with a good night\u2019s sleep, often mistaken as a Japanese business hotel, which are typically budget style hotels close to the train station, originally intended for Japanese salarymen traveling between cities for business.  Often the rooms are smaller with bare amenities, single bed, desk, tv, refrigerator, unit bath and toilet.  In Japan, tipping is not customary and in some ways can be awkward as it\u2019s unexpected.  It\u2019s ingrained in Japanese culture to take pride in your work no matter at what level, so receiving a tip as an incentive to delivery the best service is viewed as unnecessary, all tying back to Omotenashi.\n\nThe APA Hotel where I filmed (Shinjuku-Gyoenmae)\n- ",

We follow Sho from morning until evening to see what a complete day would be like working at a Japanese figure making company.  Sho works in Japan as a Genkeishi, also known as a Figure Sculptor.  Sho sculpts his anime figure prototypes by hand using Nendo, in English putty or clay, in his case, a polyester putty.  And for his main tools, uses a toothpick to add putty and a sharp q tip to smooth out the surface. Today, he is working on a Nedoroido ( Nendoroid ) style figure.  We also meet and talk to some of the other office workers in the Japanese company and give a full office tour.
