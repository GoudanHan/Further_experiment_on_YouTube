But the passengers have a large part of the journey behind them now and it won\u2019t be long until they reach Peru. They have crossed Brazil and driven through the Peruvian Amazon basin to the Andes. Here, the endless greenery of the basin gives way to increasingly steep rock faces.\n\nThe Incas worshipped these mighty mountains as deities and called them Apus - Gods. The road takes us close to one of them: Apu Ausangate, which is 6,384 meters high. The temperature here is much lower than in the Amazon basin.\n\nThe bus soon reaches Cuzco. For centuries the town was the center of the Inca Empire, until the Spaniards came and burnt it to the ground and built their own palaces on its walls. Today, the city is mainly one thing: a tourist magnet, and the starting point for tours to the legendary ruins of Machu Picchu. The complex is crumbling under the tread of millions of visitors from all over the world, and now the authorities are facing a dilemma: on the one hand, the tourists bring money; on the other the archaeologists want to preserve Machu Picchu for generations to come.\n\nParts 1-5:\nPart 1: ",

                    "description": "CNBC's Bob Pisani reports on how stocks are moving and why there's a sell-off. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nU.S. stocks fell aggressively Monday on concern a rebound in Covid cases would slow global economic growth. The selling picked up though early afternoon and the Dow Jones Industrial average was headed for its biggest drop of the year.\n\nThe Dow dropped 920 points, or 2.7%, exceeding a 2% decline in late January. The S&P 500 fell 2.1% with energy and industrial sectors as the worst performers. The tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite lost 1.5%. The small-cap  Russell 2000 briefly dropped into correction territory, falling 10.7% from its 52-week high on March 15.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield fell to a new five-month low of 1.19%, exacerbating fears about the slowing economy. Crude oil dropped more than 6%.\n\n\u201cYou have two concerns coming together... concerns about market technicals and concerns about growth,\u201d Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser of Allianz and former co-CEO of Pimco, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d before Monday\u2019s opening bell. \u201cThat\u2019s what all the asset classes are telling you.\u201d\n\nCovid cases have rebounded in the U.S. this month with the delta variant spreading among the unvaccinated. The U.S. is averaging nearly 30,000 new cases a day in the last seven days ending Friday, up from a seven-day average of around 11,000 cases a day a month ago, according to CDC data. Cases were already flaring up around the world because of the delta variant.\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index surged 6 points to as high as 24.8 amid the broad market sell-off, hitting the highest level since May. The VIX looks at prices of options on the S&P 500 to track the level of fear on Wall Street.\n\nAirlines got hit, with shares of United, Delta and American sinking more than 5%. Along with shares of cruise lines and airlines, key stocks linked to the global economy pulled back. Boeing fell 5%, and General Motors and Caterpillar dropped more than 2%.\n\n\u201cThe market appears ready to take on a more defensive character as we experience a meaningful deceleration in earnings and economic growth,\u201d Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson said in a note Monday. \u201cMarket breadth has been deteriorating for months and is just another confirmation of the mid-cycle transition, in our view. It usually ends with a material (10-20%) index level correction.\u201d\n\nWilson is advising clients to buy staples such as Mondelez International to weather the decline.\n\nOil prices fell on fears of slowing growth and as OPEC+ agreed to begin phasing out production cuts. Energy stocks were among the worst performers in the market, with with ConocoPhillips off by more than 3%. Exxon Mobil lost 3%. WTI crude shed 6% to about $68.12 a barrel.\n\nBanks took a hit as yields fell, crimping their profitability prospects. JPMorgan and Bank of America each dropped about 2.5%.\n\nBig Tech shares were not immune to the sell-off with Apple and Alphabet each down more than 2%.\n\nYet certain defensive stocks gained amid the market sell-off. Walmart and Procter & Gamble shares traded into the green, along with many utilities stocks.\n\nDespite Monday\u2019s decline, the overall damage to the market remains tame. The S&P 500 is still just 3% below its record reached last week and investors are hoping more better-than-expected earnings results will put a bottom under the market.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s market drop felt unusually jolting after months of quiet markets,\u201d said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally. \u201cBut there\u2019s been a steady rotation into stay-at-home stocks over the past few weeks with economic growth worries replacing runaway inflation concerns. The Delta variant could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.\u201d\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: ",

            "description": "Bhutan's other name is \"The Happy Kingdom.\" The small Himalayan country has one foot in the distant past and the other in the digital age. It's quite a balancing act for Bhutan's citizens.\n\nNo other country has recently undergone more radical change than Bhutan. The millennium brought television, the internet and democratization to the last Himalayan kingdom almost overnight. The capital Thimphu has become one of South Asia's fastest growing cities. At the same time, just a few kilometers to the north, 20 thousand nomads still live from herding yak on the high plains of the Himalayas. This documentary tells of the challenges these people face. \n\nWe meet young Chewang , who often has to leave his family for months and trek to heights above five thousand meters in search of the caterpillar fungus, a fabled medicinal mushroom. We also follows the journey of five-year-old Doryi, who is separated from his poverty-stricken family when they send him to a monastery. Meanwhile, the committed organic farmer Choki is trying to bring the advantages of modern life to her village. And 73-year-old bowman Ap Chimi is finding the modern world quite a challenge, so he's decided to compete in his last archery tournament to show youngsters in the village that he can still hit the bull's eye as easily as they do.\nThis documentary takes viewers on a trip through a time that mirrors Western development in the last century. The loss of a communal life in harmony with nature is juxtaposed against the gains made through globalization. Director Irja von Bernstorff, who has made her home in the Happy Kingdom, gives us a unique peek behind the country's tourist fa\u00e7ade to reveal what makes the wondrous world of Bhutan so special.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A bitcoin bear market could be confirmed if we break below both the April-May support lows (which has not yet happened).  However, there are other major risks that bitcoin could face in the weeks to come.  For example, the action on the major stock markets could likely have a big impact on bitcoin and crypto.  What could happen if the S&P 500 breaks below its June lows?  Could it potentially drag bitcoin lower towards the 20K level?  We look at the charts. ",
