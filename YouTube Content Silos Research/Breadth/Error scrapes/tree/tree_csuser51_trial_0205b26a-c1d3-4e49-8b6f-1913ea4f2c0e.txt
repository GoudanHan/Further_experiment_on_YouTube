Smollett faces six felony charges. He could spend three years in prison if he\u2019s convicted on all of them. Smollett\u2019s lawyers argue hilariously that he is the \u201creal victim,\u201d but no sober person on the planet believes that. Jussie Smollett faked a hate crime. The question is how did anyone, anywhere, ever fall for this story, even for a moment? \n...\nSubscribe to Fox News! ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

        "description": "Marc Lamont Hill sits down with Christopher F. Rufo, a contributing editor for City Journal and a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute, for an extended conversation on why he\u2019s a prominent opponent of Critical Race Theory being taught in schools.   \n\nRufo says Critical Race Theory is \u201cstate-sanctioned racism.\u201d   \n\n\u201cTeaching history, teaching context, teaching competing viewpoints is good. But what is not good is taking an ideology like Critical Race Theory, turning it into official dogma and then compelling students to believe in ideas like race essentialism, racial superiority theory,\u201d Rufo says.   \n\nHill pushes back on Rufo\u2019s claim that is what CRT teaches.   \n\n\u201cCritical race theorists hold that the law and legal institutions in the United States are inherently racist insofar as they function to create and maintain social, economic, and political inequalities between whites and nonwhites, especially African Americans,\u201d per Brittanica. \n\nTo watch BNC programming, visit ",
