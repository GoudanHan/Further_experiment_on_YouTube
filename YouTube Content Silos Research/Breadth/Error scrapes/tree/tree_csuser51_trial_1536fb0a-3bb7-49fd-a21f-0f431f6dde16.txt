            "description": "Skyrim is home to numerous factions and possibly the most notorious is the Thalmor. The rulers of the Aldmeri Dominion, the Thalmor are an infamous organization to Elder Scrolls fans, known for their suspicion of Talos and distaste for man, they're one of Skyrim's primary antagonists. Throughout the events of Skyrim, we're constantly at odds with this faction of high elves, however despite all the time we spend battling it out against them, there's still a lot about the Thalmor that The Elder Scrolls 5 doesn't tell us. So today we'll be taking a look at five things you (probably) didn't know about the Thalmor of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.",

        "description": "Skyrim and indeed the entire Elder Scrolls universe have long harbored many mysteries, however perhaps the greatest mystery in Elder Scrolls history is whatever happened to the Dwemer. The Dwemer, were of course a society of increadibly gifted elve native to modern day Skyrim and Morrowind who mysteriously vanished in the 700s of the First Era. In today's video we'll explore the theory that they very likely survived their disappearances and that the Dwemer are still out there somewhere in The Elder Scrolls universe.",

        "description": "Skyrim is home to many cities, and one of its most iconic is Whiterun. An ancient trade hub that occupies a critical position in central Skyrim, for centuries Whiterun was among the most prosperous settlements in the world. However, by the time the events of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim kick off, the city has been weakened by generations of instability and today it's not quite the same as it once was. Regardless, Whiterun occupies a pivotal role in Skyrim's main questline and many of its side narratives. So today we'll be digging a bit deeper into the lore and lesser-known details of this legendary city. Sit back and relax as we explore five things you (probably) never knew about the city of Whiterun in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.",
