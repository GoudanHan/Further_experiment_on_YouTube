                            "description": "Today, I will be raiding Roblox Bleeding Blades with the Chaos Legion. \n\nBleeding Blades is a 36 vs 36 Roblox melee sword fighting game where two teams fight and stab each other. The game ends when one of the two teams is wiped out. Each team has distinct units with unique weapons. We will be playing the two battles available at the time of recording: Battle of Thermopylae and Siege of Halicarnassus. We also played all available factions aka the Greeks (Spartans, Thebans, Thespians, Locrians and Phocians), Persians and Macedonians. The new map, Battle of Milvian Bridge, was not available at the time of the recording, so we didn\u2019t play as the Romans. If this Roblox Bleeding Blades video does well, I plan to make another one focusing on the Romans.\n\nWe tried many different strategies, including the Greek Phalanx, shield wall and mass archers. We had a lot of fun trying to replicate real life war tactics in a Roblox game and even though it wasn\u2019t the most effective strategy most of the time, it still looked pretty impressive. Of course, there were many things that will not be shown in the video because either it didn\u2019t look epic enough, not funny enough or simply because the footage is bad, this includes the Double Siege Tower master flank, ladder assault, Immortal + Archer on rock, mass sapper, sword only, etc.\n\nOf course, we also did a little bit of trolling and did some funny tactics such as mass melee archers and that was pretty poggers.\n\nAnyways, we had a lot of fun killing noobs and people surrendering in Roblox Bleeding Blades, you know, bringing the haha funny to Roblox, the usual. We had many epic and funny moments, and by the end of the raid which lasted 5 hours, we all became big Roblox pro at the game.\n\nI think this video turned out to be pretty funny, and like always, this Roblox video is filled with a crapload of jokes and memes in the form of funny moments/funny montages with an epic trailer. The video is by all means not a tutorial nor a guide. I hope you enjoyed this Roblox video, and don\u2019t forget to like and subscribe if you did for more Chaos Legion raid montages and cinematics. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis video contains a crap load of dead memes and bad jokes. Viewer discretion advised.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBe sure to leave a like if you enjoyed this Roblox video!\nThanks for watching!\nLike and subscribe for more Roblox Bleeding Blades and other funny videos.\n\nPlay Roblox Bleeding Blades: ",

It is, in my opinion, one of the best games on Roblox, and I honestly think it deserves more recognition.\n\nIn Trenches, you can build trenches, artilleries, pillboxes, foxholes, machine gun turrets and other stuff to fortify your position from enemy assaults. There are also a lot of classes that you can play, such as rifleman (sharpshooter or sniper), medic, LMG gunner, engineer, grenadier or anti-tank infantry. There are also vehicles that you can play such as the landship, behemoth, medium tank, troop carriers APCs and Artillery tank. \n\nBecause this is a CL raid, our forces will be extremely organized and coordinated. We will be doing some artillery volley fire, creeping barrage, trench charge and mass armor assault. I will be playing the role of the officer and the leader of the company. \n\nWe will be mainly using Great War tactics but also some WW2 tactics such as panzer elite tank rush and combined arms for some haha funny.\n\nSo yeah, this is the prequel of my Roblox WW2 D-Day video here\u2019s the link: ",

                        "description": "Roblox WW1 Experience in Roblox Trenches Alpha.\n\nToday, the Chaos Legion will be giving some kids PTSD in a WW1 Roblox game called Trenches Alpha. It is, in my opinion, one of the best games on Roblox, and I honestly think it deserves more recognition.\n\nIn Trenches, you can build trenches, artilleries, pillboxes, foxholes, machine gun turrets and other stuff to fortify your position from enemy assaults. There are also a lot of classes that you can play, such as rifleman (sharpshooter or sniper), medic, LMG gunner, engineer, grenadier or anti-tank infantry. There are also vehicles that you can play such as the landship, behemoth, medium tank, troop carriers APCs and Artillery tank. \n\nBecause this is a CL raid, our forces will be extremely organized and coordinated. We will be doing some artillery volley fire, creeping barrage, trench charge and mass armor assault. I will be playing the role of the officer and the leader of the company. \n\nWe will be mainly using Great War tactics but also some WW2 tactics such as panzer elite tank rush and combined arms for some haha funny.\n\nSo yeah, this is the prequel of my Roblox WW2 D-Day video here\u2019s the link: ",
