He says that the illegal rave scene in the UK and lack of funding as a university student drove him to sell drugs on a larger scale. Pieter's operation eventually supplied many big time dealers in the UK. He then began importing cocaine from Ecuador to Europe through a cartel connection. Pieter was arrested in Ecuador and sentenced to 12 years in one of the worlds most violent and corrupt prisons. He now works as a public speaker on the dangers of drugs, and also presents a show on local radio station \u201cincapable staircase\u201d every Friday from 4-5:30 pm GMT.",

As the 1980's wound down, Mechner found himself fighting against not only the limitations of the Apple II hardware but the impending death of the platform itself. Decades later, Prince of Persia remains a classic example of how the constraints of early gaming led to solutions that advanced the artform.\n\nDirected and Produced by Justin Wolfson\nEdited/GFX by Parker Dixon\n\nFootage used in this video:\nAchievementX360Nerds:",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
