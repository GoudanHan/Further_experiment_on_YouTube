I got a lot of tips, in particular, from Ethan (Hahaae321 on YouTube), and I don't think I would have ever done it without his advice and knowledge. If he comes back to defend, he will likely be the ultimate victor on this track. His skills are insane here.\n\nI also want to take a moment and thank everyone in Discord for their support and encouragement and being there for all the fails along the way. The community is a huge factor in motivation, and I probably wouldn't have done this without your support. You guys are awesome; thank you. :)\n\nLastly, I want to take a moment of silence for Seb: the man, the myth, and the legend. He maintained WR status on this track for over 7 years, and it took all my effort to finally squeeze 2 frames ahead of him after all this time. Sadly, this WR also means that he holds no more WRs, so unless he comes back, he will now be fading into history. I'm sorry i wasn't active while you were around Seb; I would have really enjoyed the competition. I'll have a beer tonight in honor of your WR here and all the WRs you set over the years.\n\nI don't think there's much else to say. I can get a better time than this, but I want to aim at a few other goals first, such as getting rid of my final #3 time (RR flap). I also have 77/80 unique WRs, and I might be able to one day make it 80/80. We'll see.\n\nCheers, hope you enjoyed the run!\n\n- Andy Lundeen",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
