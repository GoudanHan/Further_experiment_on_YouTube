                            "description": "One of the most highly anticipated championship fights in history between 2 of the absolute best heavyweights of the 1990's ends in one of the most controversial decisions boxing had seen.  \"The Lion\" Lennox Lewis vs \"The Real Deal\" Evander Holyfield.  More info below...\n\nLennox Lewis may just be the most skilled heavyweight to come out of the UK.  He had a stellar amateur career in which he won numerous Canadian titles and a gold medal at the 1988 Olympic Games, but it was as a pro that he truly made his mark.  Turning pro in 1989 Lewis quickly built a reputation as a talented fighter with both power and smarts.  Within 14 months he would capture the European Heavyweight title by stopping Jean-Maurice Chanet of France.  In his very next fight, Lewis would face his first ever undefeated opponent, Gary Mason (35-0), forcing a stoppage in Rd 7 and winning the BBBoC Heavyweight title.  He defended the BBBoC and European titles against former IBF World Cruiserweight Champion, Glenn McCrory in 1991 with a quick 2nd Rd KO.  In 1992 he added the Commonwealth Heavyweight title to his waist by stopping Dereck Williams in 3, which also netted him the Lonsdale Belt for 3 successful wins in BBBoC title fights.  In October 1992 Lewis took part in an eliminator for the WBC Heavyweight title, knocking out the dangerous Donovan Ruddick in 2 rounds.  The win put him as the number 1 contender for the title but in a surprise move, then undisputed Heavyweight Champion, Riddick Bowe, forfeited the WBC title by saying \"If Lewis wants the belt, he has to get it out of the garbage\" after both parties were unable to agree to terms.  The WBC instead, gifted their Heavyweight title to Lewis.  Lewis' 1st defence of the WBC title was against former IBF World Heavyweight Champion, Tony Tucker, winning by unanimous decision. Lewis would successfully defend the title twice more against Frank Bruno and Phil Jackson but then in 1994, Lewis suffered an upset, getting knocked out by Oliver McCall (24-5) losing his WBC title.  Lewis fired his trainer, Pepe Correa,  after the loss and hired McCall's trainer, Emanuel Steward, to rebuild himself in preparation for regaining a World title.  In 1995 Lewis fought heavy hitting Tommy Morrison for the IBC Heavyweight title, knocking him down 4 times on way to a 6th Rd TKO.  In 1996 Lewis met Ray Mercer in an absolute slugfest, pulling off a majority decision which the fans loudly booed.  In 1997, Lewis finally got his rematch with Oliver McCall for the now vacant WBC World Heavyweight title.  McCall acted extremely odd during the fight, refusing to go to his corner, crying between rounds and not throwing punches which led to ref Mills Lane to stop the fight in Rd 5, an easy day at the office for Lewis and now he was a 2 x World Champion.  Lewis would successfully defended the WBC title 4 times, twice by KO, once by decision and once by DQ, to take his record to 34-1.  \n\nEvander Holyfield had been a pro since 1984 but he to had a stellar amateur career, capped off by winning a bronze medal at the 1984 Olympics as a light heavyweight.  Holyfield started his pro career as a cruiserweight, establishing himself as a sharp, accurate, heavy puncher with a solid chin but also proving he could go the distance if needed and box smartly.  After going undefeated in 11 fights, Holyfield challenged WBA World Cruiserweight Champion, Dwight Muhammad Qawi.  It would turn out to be one the greatest Cruiserweight title fights of all time, with Holyfield claiming the win via split decision after 15 rounds.  Holyfield would go on to unify the Cruiserweight titles when he won the IBF title in 1987 from Ricky Parkey and then the WBC title in 1988 from Carlos De Leon, both by TKO.  Following the win, Holyfield turned his attention to the more lucrative heavyweight division, whom Mike Tyson was the reigning king.  Holyfield started his heavyweight journey by forcing James Tillis and then Pinklon Thomas to retire on their stools, and then in 1989 he won the WBC Continental Americas title, by 10th Rd TKO against Michael Dokes in what The Ring Magazine called the best heavyweight fight of the 1980's.  Holyfield would successfully defend the title 3 times while waiting for his shot at unified World Champion Mike Tyson... But the heavyweight division was turned on its head when Buster Douglas knocked out Tyson in February 1990.  Holyfield was the mandatory challenger and in October 1990 he stopped Douglas in 3 rounds to win the Unified World title, ending Douglas' fairy tale story.  Holyfield became arguable the biggest heavyweight attraction of the 90's with fights against men like George Foreman, Larry Holmes, Bert Cooper, Michael Moorer, Riddick Bowe, Ray Mercer and Mike Tyson.  Although he would suffer losses to Riddick Bowe and Michael Moorer, Holyfield always bounced back strong and was a 3 x World Heavyweight Champion by 1999.  His record was 36-3 and he was the reigning WBA & IBF World Heavyweight Champion.",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
