I use examples from my own life, and from others with Aspergers Syndrome to give a picture of how it feels to live with this condition, and the struggles we face day to day.\n\nMy hope is that videos like this help people to understand Autism, particularly Autism Spectrum Disorders such as Aspergers syndrome, as better mental health awareness is definitely needed.\n\nIf you really want to show your support for the channel, I have a Patreon page  --  ",

A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

A leading expert on animal behavior, she has even been the subject of a movie, in which Claire Danes played her in an award-winning performance. Her accomplishments are legion, including her creation of livestock-handling facilities based on animals' natural behavior. But her greatest impact might be as one of the most prominent adults with autism. The condition has given Grandin unique insights, orienting her work on animals and allowing her to rethink human nature. The result is a series of best-selling books\u2014\"Animals Make Us Human,\" \"Animals in Translation,\" and \"Thinking in Pictures,\" among many others\u2014as well as the hug (or \"squeeze\") machine, used for calming hypersensitive patients. More recently, autism itself has become the subject of her research. Her most recent book, \"The Autistic Brain,\" presents the latest physiological research and charts the shift from neurological to genetic approaches to the condition. Grandin shares this new work with her trademark intelligence and accessibility.\n\nThis program is generously underwritten by Rose L. Shure.",

He and I exchanged some words regarding racism, politics, and psychology, and hilarity ensued. As a disclaimer, there is no educational merit to this exchange whatsoever. This is 90 minutes of Jesse saying the dumbest things imaginable, and me mocking him relentlessly in response. Only watch this if that sounds entertaining to you.\n\nNote: I turned off comments because I got tired of spending 1-2 hours a day explaining basic logic to ignorant bigots. If you were planning to drop a comment on another video, or message me on some other platform, please first read the following:\n1) Out of wedlock does not mean single. You don't have be married to raise children together, and in fact, black couples disproportionately don't marry. Out of wedlock does not equal single parent. Read that sentence as  many times as you need to in order to get it into your skull. Jesse misrepresented the statistic, and then piled other claims on top regarding crime and drug use with no basis. He was wrong. Let me repeat. He was wrong.\n2) Jesse's ancestors were indeed slaves. He was lying. He is a liar. Google it.\n3) The history of slavery is irrelevant, so stop acting like you're a history scholar. It doesn't matter if there were times that slavery wasn't racist. When one race enslaves another race, it's racist.\n4) If you were planning on saying nothing but spewing Jesse's catch phrases, congratulations, you are among the dumbest people alive.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates/discussions: ",

He didn't like it much, so he decided to make a 14-part series about how dumb I am. He really pulled out all the stops, parading all of his classic fallacious talking points, with plenty of bald-faced lies and deliberate misrepresentations of scientific research peppered in for good measure. Honestly, I was rather shocked at how stupid it was. With so much material to work with, I ended up with quite a lot to say in response, and had to split it into two parts.\n\nIn this Part 1, we discuss how James pretends to be an expert on origin of life research but objectively isn't, and how he deliberately ignores mountains of research regarding the emergence of homochirality.\n\nPart 2 of this response: ",

            "description": "Keeping in the theme of debunking all kinds of cranks and con men in the realm of \"alternate cosmology\", let's add one more nutjob to the mix. Pierre-Marie Robitaille is a former radiologist who likes to pretend that he understands astrophysics better than astrophysicists. He doesn't. When he talks, he makes ridiculous claims and blatant errors that can be spotted by anyone with a basic understanding of physics and astronomy. Nevertheless, many gullible people speak about him like he's a genius, so I thought I'd explain quite thoroughly how he definitely isn't. If you're someone who has fallen for his lies, please watch.\n\nOther debunks in this genre:\nDebunking the SAFIRE Project: ",

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
