This video covers it all, the entire story including every single event and plot point from FNAF 1, to FNAF 2, FNAF 3, FNAF 4, FNAF Sister Location, FNAF 6, Ultimate Custom Night (UCN), FNAF AR: Special Delivery, FNAF VR: Help Wanted and FNAF: Security Breach. This is the Entire FNAF Story Explained / a FNAF Story Recap! This was absolutely insane and crazy.\n\nThis is a THEORY and not confirmed in any way/shape/form. Not everything is right, not everything is wrong, some parts might be right, some parts might be wrong, we'll never know. The Entire Timeline is simply explained in dot points at the very bottom of the description for those confused.\nThe SCRIPT for the entire video/readable version can be found here: ",
