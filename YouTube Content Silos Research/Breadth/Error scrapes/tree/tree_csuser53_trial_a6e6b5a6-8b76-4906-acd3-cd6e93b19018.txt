You pass an ornate statue as you scan the Royal Library\u2019s collections of books and antiquities. Rain falls softly on the roof above as you pull out a dusty, ancient tome. You smile as you open the book and return down the staircase.\nSeated in a cozy armchair, you pause and reflect on the perfect study ambience of the library, enjoying the quiet tranquility. Kept warm by the crackling fireplace, you make yourself comfortable, safe from the thunderstorm outside. Your thoughts wander as you sit in silent reflection. The accumulated wisdom and history of countless generations are within the leatherbound covers of the books all around you\u2014and you have it all to yourself.\n\nHope you enjoy it!\n\nPlease visit our website and check out your favorite soundscapes available to purchase:",

Unbeknownst to some, the original concept for Diablo called for a traditional, turn-based RPG - a genre Brevik came of age with and was heavily influenced by. However, following a fateful vote by show of hands at the Blizzard North offices, Diablo became something new entirely and an initially reluctant David Brevik was on the cusp of creating the first entry in a legendary action role-playing series.\n\nFootage used in this video:\nApple 2 programming tutorial",
