This video covers it all, the entire story including every single event and plot point from FNAF 1, to FNAF 2, FNAF 3, FNAF 4, FNAF Sister Location, FNAF 6, Ultimate Custom Night (UCN), FNAF AR: Special Delivery, FNAF VR: Help Wanted and FNAF: Security Breach. This is the Entire FNAF Story Explained / a FNAF Story Recap! This was absolutely insane and crazy.\n\nThis is a THEORY and not confirmed in any way/shape/form. Not everything is right, not everything is wrong, some parts might be right, some parts might be wrong, we'll never know. The Entire Timeline is simply explained in dot points at the very bottom of the description for those confused.\nThe SCRIPT for the entire video/readable version can be found here: ",

        "description": "By most accounts, America was founded in 1776 when the Founding Fathers wrote the Declaration of Independence. More recently, The New York Times Magazine launched an initiative known as the 1619 Project, aiming to redefine America\u2019s birth as being 1619, when the first slave ship arrived on American shores. Which is it: 1619 or 1776? Professor Leslie Harris outlined the 1619 Project\u2019s positions and shed light on misunderstandings about slavery in traditional teachings of American history. On the other side of this debate, Professor John McWhorter introduced the 1776 Unites campaign, which maintains 1776 as America\u2019s true founding date, upholding America\u2019s founding principles and challenging assertions that the nation is permanently scarred by its past sins. Moderated by The Atlantic\u2019s Conor Friedersdorf, this lively conversation explored if the legacy of slavery or the nation\u2019s Declaration of Independence is what truly defines America.\n\nLeslie Harris, Professor of History, Northwestern University\nJohn McWhorter, Associate Professor of English, Columbia University\nConor Friedersdorf, Staff Writer, The Atlantic (Moderator)",
