Though Rebels began its production in 2013 on the heels of layoffs, budget cuts, an accelerated development period, and the delicate expectations of the Star Wars community, it would eventually inspire a new generation of fans, and leave a new etching in the legacy of George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars mythology: a prophecy of hope. This is an analysis of that prophecy, and all the work that went into bringing it to life.\n\nCHAPTER SELECT",

Indeed, the time has come to ask the fateful question: how does liberty die?",
