The reason I pinpoint this one is because we have so many examples of Johnson doing an admirable job at acting while crying, but in that scene she\u2019s suddenly delivering her lines like she just got home from the dentist.\n\nWritten and produced by Dan Olson\n\nDrip: ",

During the extremely needed bath, which she hates, I lost control of her head and she managed to latch onto my arm and break the skin with two teeth. It looked kinda rough, so I figured I should get a tetanus shot in the morning. By the time the clinic opened I was in some of the worst pain of my life, the swollen bite looked like a tennis ball was embedded inside my arm, and the selling was pressing constantly against my ulnar nerve. The pressure was so intense that I could feel gravity pulling on my skin and fingers. Anyway, that's a big part of why this is late.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: ",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",
