And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020. \n\n\nArtist:                   Secret Garden\nAlbum:                Earthsongs\nTrack:                   Lotus\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                            "description": "Nearly 80% of college students report that procrastination is a significant issue for them. Procrastination is not a matter of mere \u201claziness\u201d and the solution is not simply \u201cbetter time management\u201d. Could it be that procrastination is actually a highly effective strategy for self-protection and that\u2019s why we continue to do it? In this talk, Nic unravels the surprising and perplexing motivational dynamics underlying our procrastination that lead so often to disengagement and burnout. Illustrated with examples drawn from two decades of coaching students, he introduces self-worth theory of motivation, a powerful research-based conceptual framework for understanding and overcoming procrastination, avoidance, and over-commitment. Dominic (Nic) Voge is Senior Associate Director of Princeton University\u2019s McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning, and author of \u201cLife Beyond Grades\u201d (Cambridge University Press). His work focuses on helping students truly thrive and achieve a sense of well-being not only academically, but in all realms of their lives. Nic is a founding member of The Resilience Consortium, the Princeton Perspective Project, and Principedia, initiatives designed to deepen engagement and learning among students. He maintains private consulting and coaching practices. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

                        "description": "Nearly 80% of college students report that procrastination is a significant issue for them. Procrastination is not a matter of mere \u201claziness\u201d and the solution is not simply \u201cbetter time management\u201d. Could it be that procrastination is actually a highly effective strategy for self-protection and that\u2019s why we continue to do it? In this talk, Nic unravels the surprising and perplexing motivational dynamics underlying our procrastination that lead so often to disengagement and burnout. Illustrated with examples drawn from two decades of coaching students, he introduces self-worth theory of motivation, a powerful research-based conceptual framework for understanding and overcoming procrastination, avoidance, and over-commitment. Dominic (Nic) Voge is Senior Associate Director of Princeton University\u2019s McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning, and author of \u201cLife Beyond Grades\u201d (Cambridge University Press). His work focuses on helping students truly thrive and achieve a sense of well-being not only academically, but in all realms of their lives. Nic is a founding member of The Resilience Consortium, the Princeton Perspective Project, and Principedia, initiatives designed to deepen engagement and learning among students. He maintains private consulting and coaching practices. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

        "description": "By facing long-held assumptions, one woman reevaluates her own gender biases. Documentary Filmmaker, The Red Pill \n\nCassie Jaye founded Jaye Bird Productions in 2008, which has since produced a  collection  of documentary films that have been praised for being thought-provoking, entertaining and respectful in representing multiple competing views within each film. Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye\u2019s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.",
