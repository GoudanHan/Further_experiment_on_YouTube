Lyons addresses the issues of Islam and modernity, Islam and violence, and Islam and women and proposes new ways of thinking about the Western relationship to the Islamic world.\n\nSpeaker Biography: Jonathan Lyons spent twenty years as a foreign correspondent and editor for Reuters, much of it in the Islamic world. His research focuses on the shifting boundaries between East and West, and his publications include \"The House of Wisdom: How the Arabs Transformed Western Civilization\" and (with Geneive Abdo) \"Answering Only to God: Faith and Freedom in Twenty-first-Century Iran.\" He has a doctorate in sociology and lives in Washington, D.C.\n\nFor captions, transcript, and more information visit ",

The film begins and ends with a shot of burning wood. The footage taken in the daytime features Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Keith Richards and Mick Jagger appear as spectators during The Flying Burrito Brothers' set. The nighttime footage features the Rolling Stones. The footage is quite dark, with Mick Jagger most visible. Most of the footage is of the performers onstage. There are also long shots of the crowd and of individuals dancing and singing. In both the daytime and nighttime footage, there are shots of Hells Angels on stage with the performers, and some shots of them getting rough and pushing people off the stage.",

While proudly continuing the unbroken nomadic lineage central to his music, Tenzin also embraces opportunities to take his music into more contemporary, uncharted territory, both in the studio and on stage. Tenzin has nine independent albums, three of them with his fusion band Tibet2Timbuk2, and regularly performs with Camerata Brisbane\u2019s acclaimed Chamber Orchestra. His collaborative albums include The Last Dalunderai Lama? with Philip Glass and the 2021 Grammy-nominated Songs from the Bardo with Laurie Anderson and Jesse Paris Smith, which is a moving interpretation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. An outstanding composer/ performer with a great depth of musical knowledge, intuition and inventiveness, Tenzin continues to bring together the two worlds of Eastern and Western music in unique compositions, collaborations and special cultural events.\n\nFor transcript and more information, visit ",

In directing this film about the crew of a B-17 \"flying fortress\" bomber as it approached its 25th mission, William Wyler insisted on using only genuine footage and soldiers, showing civilian audiences a more startlingly realistic view of the war than they'd seen before. Wyler's direct style of telling a story, masterfully written by Lester Koenig, required no embellishment. \"The situation was dramatic in itself. You didn't have to dramatize.\" Wyler was assisted by several Hollywood-trained cinematographers, often under enemy fire, and later back in Hollywood by editor John Sturges, who would go on to direct a number of popular films after the war. Upon viewing the film, President Franklin D. Roosevelt urged, \"This has to be shown right away, everywhere.\" Named to the National Film Registry in 2001.",

He spent the following few years in Kenya where he studied African traditional musical instruments and rhythms. He mastered the kalimba (thumb piano), marimba (wooden xylophone), litungu (seven-stringed Kenyan lyre) and various flutes, both traditional and western, and learned both traditional melodies and original compositions. He played with the popular African Heritage Band and the Bacchus Club Jazz Band, and played frequently at the Mount Kenya Safari Club and other leading Kenyan venues. Samite emigrated to the United States in 1987, and continued to play traditional and original music, as well to compose for film scores. He has released albums on the Shanachie, Triloka, Xenophile, and Windham Hill labels, as has been featured on compilations from Putumayo, Ellipsis Arts, and Narada. Samite spent the summer of 1999 traveling through parts of Africa, filming a PBS documentary titled Song of the Refugee, inspired by his desire to present African refugees\u2019 hopes for the future in spite of the loss and suffering they have endured. Samite founded the humanitarian non-profit organization Musicians for World Harmony in 2002. His recent work, Resilience, features \"On the Same Journey,\" which was nominated for a Hollywood Music in Media Award in 2019. In his concerts, Samite reflects on these experiences by performing songs and music from his and other African cultures.\n\nFor transcript and more information, visit ",

In directing this film about the crew of a B-17 \"flying fortress\" bomber as it approached its 25th mission, William Wyler insisted on using only genuine footage and soldiers, showing civilian audiences a more startlingly realistic view of the war than they'd seen before. Wyler's direct style of telling a story, masterfully written by Lester Koenig, required no embellishment. \"The situation was dramatic in itself. You didn't have to dramatize.\" Wyler was assisted by several Hollywood-trained cinematographers, often under enemy fire, and later back in Hollywood by editor John Sturges, who would go on to direct a number of popular films after the war. Upon viewing the film, President Franklin D. Roosevelt urged, \"This has to be shown right away, everywhere.\" Named to the National Film Registry in 2001.",
