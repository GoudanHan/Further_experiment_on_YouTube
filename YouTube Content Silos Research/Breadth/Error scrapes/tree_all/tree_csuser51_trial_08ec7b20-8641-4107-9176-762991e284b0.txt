                        "description": "At Ohio\u2019s Correctional Reception Center, the rules are tough. This is the first stop for inmates coming into the sixth largest prison system in America. Whether drug dealer or murderer, everyone is subject to the same ethos that dictates how inmates dress, walk, keep their hair, and clean their cells. It is here that Ohio sets the tone, figures out who the inmates are and moves them on to their final prison to do their time. The key to survival here is fitting in and following the rules - or face the consequences. This first episode begins a full year in Ohio\u2019s largest prisons following inmates as they are broken in to a world behind bars. Ross Correctional Institution is where our look at hard time begins in the state of Ohio. Here, over two thousand of Ohio\u2019s hardest convicts live on a camp composed of both medium and close security levels.  Weekly, a fresh crop of offenders enters the back gates of Ross to start their sentences. Knowing how to navigate this territory can only come from experience, and for those heading to close security, the learning curve is steep. Some will obey the rules, and some will break them. But no matter how inmates choose to do their time, there will be consequences, either served out by the system - or by each other. Forget what you thought you knew about women behind bars: they\u2019re the fastest growing prison population in America, and one of the toughest to manage.  At the Ohio Reformatory for Women, the system is tested daily by every kind of female offender: from capital murderers, to nursery mothers - and everything in between.  Behind these bars, there are \"pseudo-families\" instead of gangs, infants being raised by inmates, and a complicated web of contraband trades and power plays.  This is a world of women unlike any you\u2019ve ever seen.  \n----\n\"Hard Time\" is an exclusive, groundbreaking documentary series that takes a look behind the scenes of US high security prisons and immerses viewers in the brutality of life there. Prisoners, guards, wardens, families - these are stories full of desperation and hope, truth and consequence. In season 1 we accompany new prisoners and young prison guards in training. Season 2 takes us on a year-long journey behind bars in an Ohio prison, where respect is hard-earned, violence is a constant threat, and reparation is hard to come by. \"This is World War III, and we fight it every day,\" says a bitter prison guard in Season 3, which takes us to two notorious state prisons in Georgia, one of which is an all-woman prison. By focusing on a small number of inmates and guards in each episode, the series spans a strong and often heartbreaking web of lost souls.",
