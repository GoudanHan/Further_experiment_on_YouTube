                            "description": "Most characters and enemies level with you, although only up to a point. Other enemies actually have and maintain their levels regardless of how powerful you are. So with all of these things in mind, who is the strongest you can find in this game?\n\nI have compiled 3 different lists to answer this question. The first one is a list of the strongest non uniques non dragon leveled enemies you can find. This list is not literal, as a lot of vampires would be stronger than even the strongest bandits. So i tried to make it so that i could add as many cool different variations of enemies as i could find. \n\nBecause of this the first list is not authorative at all, but just a list I thought would be fun to create; and is merely a list of honorable mentions.\n\nThe second list is of the literal strongest enemies you will find in the game, unique or not. And this one is in fact literal. We will talk about difficulty for these enemies, their levels, their hp, their abilities, and everything else that is pertinent to answer the question.\n\nThe last list is for followers and we will answer which follower is the strongest in the game; and if you were to fight them, which one would pose the greater threat to you.\n\nFor those of you who don't understand how the leveling system works for enemies, is as follows: Enemies like draugrs for example who level with you will wait until you reach a threshold level. As soon as you reach that level, the game will start throwing newer and stronger versions of draugrs against you. Then as soon as you reach the next threshold, it will do so again. Until you reach the Draugr Death Overlord who is the last. This won't stop the game from sending you lesser draugrs, but merely makes it so that you can encounter stronger ones randomly. \n\nUnique enemies that scale to your level on the other hand, usually have a level multiplier that follows your level. So whatever your level is, you would multiply that with an arbitrary number like 1.2 or 1.5 and the result would be the level of the enemy. That number of course changes depending on the enemy.\n\nFollowers will always be your level, regardless of anything; up until their designated max level. After that, then they stagnate. \n\nSorry about my poor grammar. Me just a gamer. Me don't know much else.\n\nLove you all",

This is partly due to the fact that they managed to port it onto PC, Xbox, playstation, switch and Samsung smart fridge. The list goes on. Anyway today we are discovering that skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits well excluding the fork. So today I chose to revisit the game and ask the question. What if they just used a fork to defeat the dragon. and Can you beat skyrim with a fork? These are the important questions which have gone unanswered for too long! So yes today we are going to break the game with the power of Enchanted Forks! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this skyrim challenge! \n\n\nPatreon: ",

                        "description": "Most characters and enemies level with you, although only up to a point. Other enemies actually have and maintain their levels regardless of how powerful you are. So with all of these things in mind, who is the strongest you can find in this game?\n\nI have compiled 3 different lists to answer this question. The first one is a list of the strongest non uniques non dragon leveled enemies you can find. This list is not literal, as a lot of vampires would be stronger than even the strongest bandits. So i tried to make it so that i could add as many cool different variations of enemies as i could find. \n\nBecause of this the first list is not authorative at all, but just a list I thought would be fun to create; and is merely a list of honorable mentions.\n\nThe second list is of the literal strongest enemies you will find in the game, unique or not. And this one is in fact literal. We will talk about difficulty for these enemies, their levels, their hp, their abilities, and everything else that is pertinent to answer the question.\n\nThe last list is for followers and we will answer which follower is the strongest in the game; and if you were to fight them, which one would pose the greater threat to you.\n\nFor those of you who don't understand how the leveling system works for enemies, is as follows: Enemies like draugrs for example who level with you will wait until you reach a threshold level. As soon as you reach that level, the game will start throwing newer and stronger versions of draugrs against you. Then as soon as you reach the next threshold, it will do so again. Until you reach the Draugr Death Overlord who is the last. This won't stop the game from sending you lesser draugrs, but merely makes it so that you can encounter stronger ones randomly. \n\nUnique enemies that scale to your level on the other hand, usually have a level multiplier that follows your level. So whatever your level is, you would multiply that with an arbitrary number like 1.2 or 1.5 and the result would be the level of the enemy. That number of course changes depending on the enemy.\n\nFollowers will always be your level, regardless of anything; up until their designated max level. After that, then they stagnate. \n\nSorry about my poor grammar. Me just a gamer. Me don't know much else.\n\nLove you all",

From saving to world to leading its factions, The Elder Scrolls 5 certainly makes you feel like quite the benevolent protagonist. However, Skyrim does occasionally offer the Dragon a once-in-awhile opportunity to become the bad guy and embrace an inner evildoer. Sure, being the hero is fun, but sometimes siding with the villains can pay off in a special kind of way and be particularly entertaining. So today, we\u2019ll be taking a look at five more evil things you can do and may have missed in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.",

From picking between the Stormcloaks and Empire to deciding whether or not to spare Paarthurnax, The Elder Scrolls 5 is a game that affords the player a large amount of agency over its many narratives. Thankfully, many of the decisions we get to make in Skyrim are anything but easy, full of moral ambiguity rewards so tempting it\u2019s impossible to choose. These opportunities to exercise our own judgement are by far some of the most thought provoking and interesting moments in the entire world of Skyrim.

Someone could argue these are the best kids to adopt because of their very poor situations.  As such, these can be some of the saddest encounters or locations one can find when exploring.\n\nThat's always a peak of interest - sad encounters.  And in many are hidden things like Skyrim secrets, or weird secret encounters.  Which often lead to fan theories or perhaps your own theory?  Although here, deciding who the best children are comes down to some of the hardest decisions, as, generally speaking, the kids in this land don't give off such a good impression.

In today's video I explore all the shouts in Skyrim, including those in the Dawnguard and Dragonborn expansions and rank them accordingly.\n\nDragon Shouts also referred to as Shouts or Thu'um in the Dragon language, are an ancient form of magic. They use the vocalization of specific \"words of power\" to create powerful magical effects, usually for offensive purposes. Each Shout is made up of three words, however, one or two words of a given Shout may be used, but the effect is correspondingly less powerful compared to the full force of the whole shout.\n\nThis ranking is based solely on the third tier of all shouts and so doesn\u2019t include the first and second tiers. Additionally, perks and attributes that buff the standard shout are not covered, otherwise this video would more than likely be double its length! And just to point out, this is in my own opinion and may vary for you depending on your own build, approach, your opinion in general, etc. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more top notch Skyrim content!",

Windhelm certainly looks cool, but after lots of thinking and consideration, we probably wouldn't want to spend much time there. In this video you will meet the faces of Windhelm, hear their stories, and perhaps get an insight into this Skyrim city that you may not have previously thought about. Just keep your wits about you, for Calixto could be lurking around any corner!\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series and was released worldwide on November 11, 2011. The game's main story revolves around the player character and their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The videogame is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. \n\nAt FudgeMuppet, we uncover the elder scrolls lore secrets that make this game so sensational, and in this video we're going to be diving into all of the events in Windhelm! We'll talk to the richest families and the poorest dock workers, piecing together their stories and building a picture of it all which proves that this city is sad no matter where you look. We do have many Skyrim mods on display which enhance the appearance of Skyrim's cities, and if you were to look at vanilla Skyrim, particularly the Gray Quarter, it is far less festive than shown in this video. If you think about it, this only strengthens the message of the video. It is also worth noting, which is talked about towards the end of the video, that even if you decide to take over the city with the Empire and wipe out the Stormcloaks, all you do is shift around the vibes and emotions in the city, as opposed to actually improving them.\n\nMERCH: ",

From picking between the Stormcloaks and Empire to deciding whether or not to spare Paarthurnax, The Elder Scrolls 5 is a game that affords the player a large amount of agency over its many narratives.

These opportunities to exercise our own judgement are by far some of the most thought provoking and interesting moments in the entire world of Skyrim. So today, we\u2019ll be exploring some of the absolute best as we dive right into my top five toughest choices in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.",
