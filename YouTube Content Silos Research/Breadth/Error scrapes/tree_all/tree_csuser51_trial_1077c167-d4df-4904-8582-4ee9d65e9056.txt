It happened to be his birthday, and we were there just in time to answer his prayers. This was a beautiful experience for all of us, and luckily, we caught it on video!\n\nSpecial thanks to CopyPress for throwing the Unconference in Chicago, where attendance was free as long as attendees donated a backpack for our charity event the next day. This generous gesture, along with the generosity of all who attended, created some magical moments, and helped dozens of homeless people in downtown Chicago! Here's footage of the event, including a clip of Albert! ",
