Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.\n\nIn this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u2019s original holy city \u2013 as detailed in the Qur\u2019an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u2019s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u2018forbidden gathering place\u2019. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.\n\nIn the film \u2018The Sacred City\u2019 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u2013 while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.\n\nWhile clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u2019s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u2019an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.\n\nIn a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.\n\nBeautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

This golden age was threatened by the growing power of Karnak's priests, and Joann reveals how Tutankhamen's early death was a chance for Egypt to start afresh and rewrite history, but was undermined by decades of state-sanctioned looting of the tombs.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

One hundred and fifty years ago, a corporation was a relatively insignificant entity. Today, it is a vivid, dramatic, and pervasive presence in all our lives. Like the Church, the Monarchy and the Communist Party in other times and places, a corporation is today\u2019s dominant institution. Charting the rise of such an institution aimed at achieving specific economic goals, the documentary also recounts victories against this apparently invincible force.\n\n'The New Corporation' was released in 2020.\nSee the film and the trailer that Twitter censored!

You have to challenge\u201d\n\nRecently a team of fossil hunters working in Kenya came upon a set of fossilised teeth and a series of bones. Their find set in motion a chain of events that ignited excitement across the scientific world, for if they were correct in their findings, not only would they have found the oldest human ancestor, but much of the received wisdom humankind\u2019s evolution would have to be rewritten. This programme is the story of their discovery and the implications it has for understanding of how we split from the apes. Dubbed \u201cMillennium Man\u201d by the press, he is twice as old as the most famous skeleton in the world \u201cLucy\u201d. The remarkable link between Millennium Man and humans is his ability to walk on two legs, overturning previously accepted scientific opinion on why, how and when humans began to walk. As Professor Senut who worked on the project points out, \u201cScience doesn\u2019t proceed or get better with established ideas. You have to challenge\u201d and Millennium Man seems to be challenging an awful lot of accepted science. Documentary first broadcast in 2001.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

            "description": "The Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was perhaps the most widely documented act of political violence in history. The New York Times obtained, analyzed and mapped out thousands of cellphone videos, police bodycam recordings and internal police audio to provide the most complete picture to date of what happened \u2014 and why. Our Oscar-shortlisted documentary \u201cDay of Rage\u201d charts in chilling detail how the peaceful transition of power was disrupted by rioters who stormed a seemingly impenetrable seat of government.\n\nThe team behind \u201cDay of Rage\u201d will release scenes and other reporting that were left on the cutting room floor on the film\u2019s Twitter account, @dayofrage.\n\nSign up for our Visual Investigations newsletter: ",
