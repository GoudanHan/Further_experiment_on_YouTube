                        "description": "Half a century ago, on 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong was in the final stages of the lunar descent, just a few thousand feet above the surface, when suddenly his on-board computer indicated a critical alarm. For three nail-biting seconds it looked as if the mission would have to be aborted. However, Armstrong was given a \"go\" to continue, and after several more alarms the Eagle touched down safely on the Moon.\n\nRobert Wills introduces the amazing hardware and software that made up the Apollo Guidance Computer, walks you through the landing procedure step-by-step, and talks about the pioneering design principles that were used to make the landing software robust against any failure. He also explains the problems that occurred during the Apollo 11 landing, and shows you how the Apollo Guidance Computer played its part in saving the mission.\n\nChapters:",

            "description": "Former US submarine commander L. David Marquet rated the realism of submarine scenes in popular movies, judging their technological accuracy as well as the depiction of life on board.\n\nMarquet addresses the realism of nuclear crisis movies, such as \"The World Is Not Enough\" and \"K-19: The Widowmaker,\". He also rated the accuracy of standoff scenes in \"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"The Enemy Below\", \"Hunter Killer,\" and \"Crimson Tide.\" He also breaks down the realism of costumes, tactics, and terminology from \"U-571.\"\n\nIs life on board a submarine, including confined conditions and drills, as depicted in \"Das Boot\"? Would Navy SEALs enter a submarine from a HALO drop similar to \"Act of Valor\", and is it possible for a submarine to hear music from the water's surface, like in  \"The Wolf's Call\"? Can holes on a submarine be plugged with pins and other metal objects, as we see in \"The Simpsons\"? Would nuclear missiles be triggered by dislodging in a ship interior, such as in \"Aquaman\"?\n\nMarquet graduated top of his class from the US Naval Academy and served for 28 years on submarines, including as an engineer officer aboard the USS Will Rogers, then as captain on the USS Olympia and the USS Santa Fe. Having retired in 2009, he is now a Wall Street Journal best-selling author of \"Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders.\"\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

Here, he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from jungle-warfare movies and rates them based on their accuracy. \n\nMason reviews classic Hollywood movies such as \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), \"Platoon\" (1986), \"Tears of the Sun\" (2003), \"Forrest Gump\" (1994), and \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002). He also rates the realism of the HBO miniseries \"The Pacific\" (2010).How reasonable are the jungle tactics in \"Predator\" (1987)? Does Christian Bale use the correct method for jungle helicopter rescue in \"Rescue Dawn\" (2006)? How realistic are the stealth and sniping tactics in \"Sniper\" (1993)? And would the camouflage Sylvester Stallone uses in \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" (1985) be successful? The Jungle Operations Training Course in Hawaii is a 12-day program for US Army regiments that covers mobility training, waterborne operations, combat tracking, jungle tactics, and survival training. Students learn tactics, techniques, and procedures required to fight, win, and survive. There are 10 courses a year for regular active-duty soldiers, Marines, sailors, and airmen, and menu-based training for Special Operations. Mason has been involved in the course since 2014 and became the senior instructor in 2018. \n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

            "description": "To celebrate the release of \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d we had physicist (and lifelong comic book fan) Jim Kakalios take a closer look at the physics of the Marvel universe. Here he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from Marvel movies and rates them based on their accuracy. Find out what exactly quantum mechanics, time dilation, Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, and spider silk tell us about the superheroes of the Marvel franchise.\n\nWhich weapon would you rather have in a fight: Thor\u2019s Mjolnir hammer or Captain America\u2019s shield? Hint: The answer has to do with the conservation of energy \u2014 and the sonoluminescence of vibranium. Dr. Kakalios breaks down the physics behind this and many other Marvel phenomena, including Shuri\u2019s holographic car in \u201cBlack Panther;\u201d  Peter Parker\u2019s spider-webbing train save in \u201cSpider-Man 2;\u201d the multiverse theory of \u201cDoctor Strange;\u201d the role of Pym particles and the Higgs boson in \u201cAnt-Man;\u201d artificial gravity in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy;\u201d and Tony Stark\u2019s cybernetic helmet and gold-titanium exoskeleton in \u201cIron Man.\u201d He sheds light on why Carol Danvers doesn\u2019t age from \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d to \u201cAvengers: Endgame;\u201d why the Space Stone is so powerful when yielded by Thanos in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War;\u201d and what\u2019s with all the talk of quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling, and \u201cquantum mumbo-jumbo\u201d in \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp.\u201d\n\nKakalios is the author of three books \u2014 \u201cThe Physics of Superheroes,\u201d \u201cThe Physics of Everyday Things,\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics.\u201d He was a science consultant for Sony\u2019s 2012 film \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man.\u201d Before that, he won an Emmy for his work as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. superhero film \u201cWatchmen.\u201d A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.\n\nFor more, visit:",

In the sport of fast draw, competitors attempt to be the quickest to shoot a target. They use wax bullets or black powder blanks to hit targets at various distances and of various sizes.\n\nFranks rates the realism of quick-draw scenes in films such as \"Django Unchained\" (2012), \"The Good the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966), and \"Westworld\" (2016). She breaks down some of the differences between modern quick draws with semiautomatic guns, like in \"Collateral\" (2004) and  \"John Wick\" (2014).\n\nShe analyzes classic Western movies like \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964), \"Tombstone\" (1993), \"Trinity Is Still My Name\" (1971), and \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960), discussing the different styles of guns, gun holsters, and stances. She even takes a look at some futurist quick draws, like those shown in \"The Mandalorian\" (2020) and \"Star Wars: Episode V \u2014 The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980).\n\nMORE  HOW REAL IS IT?\nMiss USA 2019 Rates 8 Pageant Scenes In Movies and TV | How Real Is It?",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
