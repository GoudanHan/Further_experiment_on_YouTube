Craig is one of the world\u2019s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the \u201cnew atheism\u201d movement. \n\nIn front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christ\u2019s resurrection.

This means you can heal yourself with your mind, you can manifest your desires, and you can commune with the universe to achieve ultimate transcendence! At least that's what some would have you believe. In actuality, physics says nothing of the sort. This is all just a ridiculous narrative spewed by con men that has come to be known as quantum mysticism. Together let's identify its origin, with figures like Deepak Chopra, and trace its development over the past few decades, culminating in YouTube channels like Spirit Science and Actualized.org, which go beyond mere pseudoscience and act as literal cults. Cults are bad, don't you agree? Let's expose and disarm them together.\n\nThanks to Chester Ho for help researching Actualized.org, check out his channel: ",

Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.\n\nDirected by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?\n\nFind out more: ",
