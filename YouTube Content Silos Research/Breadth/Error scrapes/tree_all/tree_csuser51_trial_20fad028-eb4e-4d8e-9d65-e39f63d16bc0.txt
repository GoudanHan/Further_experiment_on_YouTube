            "description": "Michael Franzese, a former New York mobster and ex-caporegime of the Colombo crime family, rates classic mafia movie scenes on how accurate they are. The US mafia is featured in many classic movies from the 1920s onwards. We discuss the cultural significance and accuracy of famous crime scenes in movies and TV shows, such as \"The Godfather\" and \"The Sopranos.\" Franzese also points out inaccuracies in scenes from mob comedies such as \"Analyze This\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nFranzese discusses true stories and real-life characters featured in \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino.\" He talks about his proximity to the events of Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman,\" the Oscar-nominated movie starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. \n\nAfter Franzese was released from prison in 1995, he became the only high ranking official of a major mafia family to ever walk away, without protective custody, and survive. Franzese is the author of \"Blood Covenant\" and \"I\u2019ll Make You An Offer You Can\u2019t Refuse.\" He now works as a public speaker and motivator.\n\nMORE 'HOW REAL IS IT?':\n\nExplosives Expert Rates Movie Explosions: ",
