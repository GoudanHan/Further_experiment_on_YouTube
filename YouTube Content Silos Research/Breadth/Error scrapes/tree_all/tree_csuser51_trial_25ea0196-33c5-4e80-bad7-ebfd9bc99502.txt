                            "description": "The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza presented an engaging program featuring renowned forensic pathologist, consultant and author Dr. Cyril H. Wecht. In this two-part presentation, Museum Curator Stephen Fagin led Dr. Wecht in conversation on his remarkable career and longtime interest in the assassination. Wecht then delivered a multimedia lecture on key areas of the Warren Commission\u2019s 1964 investigation, including President Kennedy\u2019s autopsy and the controversial single bullet theory. \n\nDr. Wecht began researching the Kennedy assassination when he was invited to speak before the 1965 meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. More than half a century later, Wecht continues to lecture and give media interviews on the assassination. As a distinguished elder statesman of the assassination research community and current chairman of the Citizens Against Political Assassinations organization, Wecht remains an outspoken critic of the Warren Commission\u2019s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. \n\nThis video contains adult language and graphic imagery which may be disturbing. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nThis presentation took place on April 11, 2017.

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

In the fifth estate\u2019s season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science \u2014 and the reaction from the food industry \u2014 to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?\n\nA small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nWe put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists \u2013 and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.\n\nOriginal airdate : October 4th, 2013\n\nFor more on the fifth estate : ",

            "description": "Keeping in the theme of debunking all kinds of cranks and con men in the realm of \"alternate cosmology\", let's add one more nutjob to the mix. Pierre-Marie Robitaille is a former radiologist who likes to pretend that he understands astrophysics better than astrophysicists. He doesn't. When he talks, he makes ridiculous claims and blatant errors that can be spotted by anyone with a basic understanding of physics and astronomy. Nevertheless, many gullible people speak about him like he's a genius, so I thought I'd explain quite thoroughly how he definitely isn't. If you're someone who has fallen for his lies, please watch.\n\nOther debunks in this genre:\nDebunking the SAFIRE Project: ",

Rand and his brother, Robyn, compressed the image and audio data as much as they could so the game could run smoothly on 1x CD-ROM drives.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
