Subscribe! \u25ba http://goo.gl/WCIhMQ\n\nIn 1984, during the Cold War, a Russian programmer named Alexey Pajitnov created something special: A puzzle game called Tetris. It soon gained a cult following within the Soviet Union. A battle for the rights to publish Tetris erupted when the game crossed the Iron Curtain. Tetris not only took the video game industry by storm, but it also helped break the boundaries between the United States and the Soviet Union. \n\nIntro - ",

The 3DO Interactive Mulitplayer and Atari Jaguar both launched in 1993, Nintendo used the Super FX chip to create polygonal 3D games like Star Fox and Stunt Race FX on the Super Nintendo, while Sega used the SVP chip to create a home port of arcade hit Virtua Racing on the Genesis.  In 1993, Nintendo partnered with Silicon Graphics to develop their next-generation hardware, while in 1995, the release of both the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation signaled the \"real\" beginning of home 3D gaming.   After numerous delays, Nintendo finally joined the next generation of consoles, as the Nintendo 64 was launched in Japan and North America in mid 1996.  Although many gamers who grew up playing the Nintendo Entertainment System had, by the mid 90's, moved on to more \"grown-up\" systems like the Playstation and Saturn, the Nintendo 64 was a big part of the 90's childhood, and made Nintendo fanatics out of a whole new generation of gamers.\n\nCheck out Banjo Guy Ollie: ",

Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.\n\nIn this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u2019s original holy city \u2013 as detailed in the Qur\u2019an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u2019s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u2018forbidden gathering place\u2019. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.\n\nIn the film \u2018The Sacred City\u2019 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u2013 while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.\n\nWhile clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u2019s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u2019an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.\n\nIn a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.\n\nBeautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
