Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.\n\nDirected by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?\n\nFind out more: ",

More than 20 collisions between American and Soviet submarines are only the tip of the iceberg as far as these secret operations are concerned. The underwater interface was perhaps the most merciless frontier between East and West. This documentary reveals previously unknown information from the military apparatus of both sides, and shows that submarines continue to be an important weapon in the espionage war even today.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa It's like Netflix for history...

She is the recipient of four United States Attorney Awards for Distinguished Service. She now hosts the true-crime podcast \"FBI Retired Case File Review\" and works as a technical consultant for TV shows and movies depicting the FBI. \n\nWilliams is the author of \"FBI Myths and Misconceptions: A Manual for Armchair Detectives\": ",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
