Rand and his brother, Robyn, compressed the image and audio data as much as they could so the game could run smoothly on 1x CD-ROM drives.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",

This is the true story of The Nazi\u2019s Temple of Doom.\n\nAlthough disappointed by the discovery that a Celtic Cauldron was in fact manufactured in the 20th Century, it soon became apparent that this mysterious item could tell us more about the intricacies of Nazi plans for Germany than has ever been explored before. \n\nThe Nazi Temple Of Doom follows the journey of how one item, found in Chiemsee Lake in Germany, revealed dark secrets about a group that were already known for their interest in Ancient Mythology and the Occult: the Nazis. Using the Nazi-made Celtic cauldron as a starting point, experts piece together the fascinating depths to which the Nazi ideology reached and explore their goals and expectations. It was long the objective of Heinrich Himmler, one of the highest members of the Third Reich and Head of the SS, to create a racially pure society in which a glorious German history was celebrated. In 1934, Himmler chose Wewelsburg Castle and its dark past as the SS base, and the beginnings of a Nazi cult, based on pre-Christian Germany, as he believed Christianity had no place in the ideology ofthe SS. \n\nThis documentary special tells the tale of how Himmler drafted in experts to research and re-write a mythological, glorious German history and to build a Nazi-Vatican. The cauldron played an integral part in furthering Himmler\u2019s cult and proving what he believed were Germany\u2019s true Celtic origins. \n\nUsing library footage, interviews and a gripping storyline, The Nazi Temple Of Doom reveals previously unexplored territory in the Nazi regime. \n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

A duel of false promises, evasion and delusion ensued, which was far removed from the more familiar image of friendship and loyalty. World War II was not only a military conflict. It was also a series of private psychological battles waged by the four great leaders: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. In these mental duels, the 'warlords' lied, schemed, charmed, flattered and cheated to win. \n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.\n\nDirected by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?\n\nFind out more: ",

And I think that's a mistake, because volume just isn't something the human brain is great at. So instead, here's the difference between a million and a billion, in a more one-dimensional way: distance.\n\n\nREFERENCES:\nHumphrey Yang's rice TikTok: ",

Smollett faces six felony charges. He could spend three years in prison if he\u2019s convicted on all of them. Smollett\u2019s lawyers argue hilariously that he is the \u201creal victim,\u201d but no sober person on the planet believes that. Jussie Smollett faked a hate crime. The question is how did anyone, anywhere, ever fall for this story, even for a moment? \n...\nSubscribe to Fox News! ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
