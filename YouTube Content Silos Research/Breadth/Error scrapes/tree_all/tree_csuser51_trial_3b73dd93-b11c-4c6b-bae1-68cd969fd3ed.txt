It's bad, very, very bad, and join me as I take you through, analyzing and picking apart each and every little bit of this terrible, terrible title. I review it's cutscenes, story, and particularly gameplay to demonstrate how it fails to do what Half Life 2 did flawlessly, while also failing on it's own merits, it's rife with glitches, bad acting, and it's just shit.\n\nIt also has Keemstar playing the US president, while IHE and Pyrocynical play US marines, it's fucking wild.\n\nPatreon: ",
