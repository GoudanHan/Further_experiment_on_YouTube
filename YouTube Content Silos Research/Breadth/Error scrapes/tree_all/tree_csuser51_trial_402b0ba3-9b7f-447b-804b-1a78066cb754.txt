Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice investigate the limits of temperature and a lot more. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn why there\u2019s really no limit of how hot you can make something. On the flip side, we dive into why making things colder is a different story. How do you create a place where there is no heat? You\u2019ll find out more about the Kelvin scale or absolute temperature scale. \n\nNeil takes us through the process of cooling things down. Discover the differences between temperature and heat energy. We explore the vibration of particles and dip our toes into Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution. Then, Neil tells us why we can never philosophically or theoretically reach absolute zero. \n\nTo wrap things up, we investigate what happens when quantum physics take over. Discover more about superfluidity. All that, plus, you\u2019ll hear about the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate and how we can \u201cshape-shift\u201d matter.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: ",

In April 2017, National Geographic renewed the series for a second season, which follows the life and artistry of Pablo Picasso and aired from April 24 to June 19, 2018. In April 2018, National Geographic renewed the series for a third season, which is set to follow the life of Aretha Franklin and will premiere late in 2020.\n\nThis content is owned by National geographic and is posted here only for Educational purpose.\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under Section 107 of the copyright act 1976, allowance is made for fair use for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarship, and research.
