A lot, it turns out: the search for extraterrestrials requires the help from astronomers, planetary scientists, chemists, computer scientists, and geneticists, just to name a few. But are we barking up the wrong carbon-based tree? Could alien life develop in ways we haven't dreamed of here on Earth? Hear Paul Davies, Sara Seager, Jack Szostak, and other experts give updates on the search for life outside our planet in \"Alien Life: Will We Know It When We See It?\" part of the Big Ideas series at the 2014 World Science Festival.\n\nThis program is part of the Big Ideas Series, made possible with support from the John Templeton Foundation.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel for all the latest from WSF.\nVisit our Website: ",
