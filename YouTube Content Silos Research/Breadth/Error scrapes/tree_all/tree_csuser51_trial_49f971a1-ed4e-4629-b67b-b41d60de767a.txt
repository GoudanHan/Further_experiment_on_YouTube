In celebration of Tyson\u2019s new book, \u201cAstrophysics for People in a Hurry,\u201d the duo will discuss his illustrious career as a science communicator and the resurgence of \u201cnerd\u201d culture, as well as a bevy of mind\u2013bending questions such as the nature of space and time, how we fit within the universe, and how the universe fits within us. In a world where few of us have time to contemplate the cosmos, Tyson brings the universe down to earth succinctly and clearly, with sparkling wit, in tasty chapters consumable anytime and anywhere in your busy day.\n\nFilmed live at TheTimesCenter.",

I feel that after 7+ years of constant, ignorant comments, that it is better to simply shut it off.  I apologize to those who actually had thoughtful, intelligent exchanges in the comments.

This means you can heal yourself with your mind, you can manifest your desires, and you can commune with the universe to achieve ultimate transcendence! At least that's what some would have you believe. In actuality, physics says nothing of the sort. This is all just a ridiculous narrative spewed by con men that has come to be known as quantum mysticism. Together let's identify its origin, with figures like Deepak Chopra, and trace its development over the past few decades, culminating in YouTube channels like Spirit Science and Actualized.org, which go beyond mere pseudoscience and act as literal cults. Cults are bad, don't you agree? Let's expose and disarm them together.\n\nThanks to Chester Ho for help researching Actualized.org, check out his channel: ",

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",
