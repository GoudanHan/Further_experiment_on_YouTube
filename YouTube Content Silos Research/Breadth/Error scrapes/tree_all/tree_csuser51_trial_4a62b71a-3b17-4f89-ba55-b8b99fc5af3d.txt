Known as \"The Reaper,\" Irving says he killed 33 enemies as a sniper for the US 3rd Ranger Battalion. He is the co-author of \"Reaper: Drone Strike: A Sniper Novel.\"\n\nIrving rates the realism of classic war movies such as \"Clear and Present Danger\" (1994), \"Enemy at the Gates\" (2001), and \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998). He breaks down long-range-sniping scenes featuring Will Smith in \"Gemini Man\" (2019) and Mark Wahlberg in \"Shooter\" (2007). \nHe also looks at modern-day war movies set in Iraq and Afghanistan, such as \"American Sniper\" (2014), \"Jarhead\" (2005), \"Lone Survivor\" (2013), and \"The Hurt Locker\" (2009). Irving rates the realism of the weapons used, along with body position, stealth, and environment. \n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nForensic Pathologist Rates 11 Autopsy Scenes In Movies | How Real Is It?",
