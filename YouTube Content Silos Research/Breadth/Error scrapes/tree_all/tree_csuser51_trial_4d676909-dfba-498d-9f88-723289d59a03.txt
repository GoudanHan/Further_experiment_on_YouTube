History is now repeating itself around the world.\n\nBased on a book by Professor Richard Werner, a visiting researcher at the Bank of Japan during the 90s crash, during which the stock market dropped by 80% and house prices by up to 84%. The film uncovers how the Bank of Japan pumped up and then crashed the Japanese economy, with an aim of inducing change. Today, what happened in Japan 25 years ago is repeating itself in Europe, with an aim of centralising power in the Eurozone.\n\nThe film shows why it is important for central banks to be accountable and transparent. It also explains how International Financial Organisations such as the IMF seek to impose conditions on countries that are mainly of benefit to dominant Western interests. For anyone interested in understanding recent developments and the significance of the establishment of institutions such as the AIIB and the BRICS led New Development Bank, Princes of the Yen provides the background.\n\nPrinces of the Yen reveals with clarity the control levers that underpin the dominant ideology of the 21st Century. Piece by piece, reality is deconstructed to reveal the world as it is, not as those in power would like us to believe that it is.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

(one or two days is even better!)\n#3 Get yourself a good instant read thermometer, pushing your thumb in the palm of your hand DOES NOT WORK!\n#4 Searing the steak DOES NOT seal in the juices. (its only purpose is to create a delicious crust)\n#5 Be sure to let it rest at least 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven. Before cutting into it.\n\nRecipe Link: ",

Across the Harlem River, 10 minutes to the north, is the other Park Avenue in South Bronx, where more than half the population live on food stamps and children are 20 times more likely to be killed. In the last 30 years, inequality has rocketed in the US -- the American Dream only applies to those with enough money to lobby politicians for friendly bills on Capitol Hill.\n\nFilmmaker: Alex Gibney\nProducer: Blair Foster\nProduced by Jigsaw Productions & THE WHY Foundation\nReleased: 2012\n\nThis film was originally released as part of THE WHY series WHY POVERTY?.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
