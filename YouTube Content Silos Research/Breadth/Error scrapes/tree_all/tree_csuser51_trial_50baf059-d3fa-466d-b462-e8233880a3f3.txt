            "description": "Bomb disposal expert Lloyd Davies rates the realism of bomb-disposal scenes in popular movies and TV shows. \n\nDavies addresses land mines in the TV show \"SEAL Team\" (2018) and other improvised explosive devices in \"The Hurt Locker\" (2008), \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" (1995), and \"Bodyguard\" (2018). \nHe breaks down the \"red wire, blue wire\" movie device from \"Juggernaut\" (1974) and \"Blown Away\" (1994). \n\nWould nuclear devices have countdown timers as seen in \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\" (2018)? Does sarin gas release the way it's shown in \"The Rock\" (1996)? And would a bathtub protect you from an explosion such as in \"Lethal Weapon 2\" (1989)? \n\nDavies led specialist teams in Iraq and Afghanistan as one of the British Army's leading bomb-disposal and weapons-intelligence experts. As an advanced IEDD operator, he also trained deployable EOD teams and served as the principal bomb-disposal operator within the UK's premier counterterrorism unit. He was the military advisor to the Ministry of Defence's Special Projects Search and Countermeasures delivery team and remains an internationally recognized authority on CT bomb disposal and defense robotics.\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nPhysicist Rates 11 'Fast And Furious' Movie Stunts | How Real Is It?",
