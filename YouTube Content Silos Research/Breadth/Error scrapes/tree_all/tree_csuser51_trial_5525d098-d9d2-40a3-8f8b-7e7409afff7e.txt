The HyperCard-developed title ran into some snags when trying to run on the CD-ROM format. \"I had a really powerful Mac, with a lot of memory and a lot of hard drive space, and we were still working in mud,\" said Rand, discussing the game's performance early-on. Rand and his brother, Robyn, compressed the image and audio data as much as they could so the game could run smoothly on 1x CD-ROM drives.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",

This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal. The last three were all awarded by the now-extinct government of the Republic of Vietnam.  He received the PUC and the two Vietnamese unit citations as a member of 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. You can find more at his website -www.wdehrhart.com. ",

            "description": "To celebrate the release of \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d we had physicist (and lifelong comic book fan) Jim Kakalios take a closer look at the physics of the Marvel universe. Here he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from Marvel movies and rates them based on their accuracy. Find out what exactly quantum mechanics, time dilation, Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, and spider silk tell us about the superheroes of the Marvel franchise.\n\nWhich weapon would you rather have in a fight: Thor\u2019s Mjolnir hammer or Captain America\u2019s shield? Hint: The answer has to do with the conservation of energy \u2014 and the sonoluminescence of vibranium. Dr. Kakalios breaks down the physics behind this and many other Marvel phenomena, including Shuri\u2019s holographic car in \u201cBlack Panther;\u201d  Peter Parker\u2019s spider-webbing train save in \u201cSpider-Man 2;\u201d the multiverse theory of \u201cDoctor Strange;\u201d the role of Pym particles and the Higgs boson in \u201cAnt-Man;\u201d artificial gravity in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy;\u201d and Tony Stark\u2019s cybernetic helmet and gold-titanium exoskeleton in \u201cIron Man.\u201d He sheds light on why Carol Danvers doesn\u2019t age from \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d to \u201cAvengers: Endgame;\u201d why the Space Stone is so powerful when yielded by Thanos in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War;\u201d and what\u2019s with all the talk of quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling, and \u201cquantum mumbo-jumbo\u201d in \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp.\u201d\n\nKakalios is the author of three books \u2014 \u201cThe Physics of Superheroes,\u201d \u201cThe Physics of Everyday Things,\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics.\u201d He was a science consultant for Sony\u2019s 2012 film \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man.\u201d Before that, he won an Emmy for his work as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. superhero film \u201cWatchmen.\u201d A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.\n\nFor more, visit:",

Furious about this, Elon Musk has taken to twitter to fight back against Warren while at the same time exposing her corrupt behaviour, showing that she herself has not paid tax, while in fact Elon Musk will be paying more tax this year than any individual throughout history.",
