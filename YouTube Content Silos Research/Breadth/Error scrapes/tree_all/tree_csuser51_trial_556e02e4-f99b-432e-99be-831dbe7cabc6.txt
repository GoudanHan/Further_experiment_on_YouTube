It starts with a very simple question: what is the difference between those who do something special with their lives and everyone else?  In Outliers we\u0393\u00c7\u00d6re going to visit a genius who lives on a horse farm in Northern Missouri. We\u0393\u00c7\u00d6re going to examine the bizarre histories of professional hockey players and look into the peculiar childhood of Bill Gates and spend time in a Chinese rice paddy.  We will investigate the world\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s greatest law firm and wonder about what distinguishes pilots who crash planes from those who don\u0393\u00c7\u00d6t.  And in examining the lives of the remarkable among us\u0393\u00c7\u00f6the brilliant, the exceptional and the unusual\u0393\u00c7\u00f6we will learn that the way we think about success is all wrong.",

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

I have been warning everyone since last year about what these \"fact-checkers\" represent, and we are inching ever-closer to a totalitarian state. I began suing the fact-checkers last year because I knew that their actions would culminate into this extraordinary moment in American history: a sitting President of the United States has been censored. This means none of us are safe from being wiped away. My Facebook page has long since been demonetized but I believe we can make this video viral by sharing person to person.
