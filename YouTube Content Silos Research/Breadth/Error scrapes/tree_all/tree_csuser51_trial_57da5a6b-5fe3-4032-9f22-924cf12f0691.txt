Over 50 million car tires are sold each year in Germany alone. But where does the natural rubber for them come from?\n\nThe biggest producer of natural rubber for tires is Thailand. More than four million tonnes of rubber are harvested annually in plantations there. And demand for rubber is ever growing - because ever more tires are needed. But the labor conditions in Southeast Asia are harsh - with working days of up to 12 hours and very low wages. In addition, toxic herbicides banned in Europe are used to fight weeds on the plantations. After the harvest, the \u2018white gold\u2019 rubber is sold to brokers, who, in turn, sell it on. German tire manufacturers, like Continental, for example, are keen to stress that they use \"natural commodities conscientiously.\u201d But many car drivers don\u2019t give a second thought about where the rubber in their tires comes from - and why we don\u2019t recycle used tires more effectively. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In the fifth estate\u2019s season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science \u2014 and the reaction from the food industry \u2014 to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?\n\nA small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nWe put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists \u2013 and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.\n\nOriginal airdate : October 4th, 2013\n\nFor more on the fifth estate : ",

Are you using regular and damaging your engine? This video will bust all of the myths and tell you the FACTS on what fuel you should use and why.\n\nMany people throw money away and fill their car with the incorrect fuel every day. Running premium or midgrade in a car designed to run regular is a waste of money and has no HP or MPG benefits. You will not make more power or get better fuel economy running premium fuel if the car manufacturer tunes the car to use regular gas in most cases. I also see some people run regular gas in cars that need premium and the knock sensors have to adjust timing significantly to prevent damaging engine knock. I also hear a lot of people say that premium gasoline has more energy or burns cooler or slower so I will put a rest to all of these \"myths\" with facts.\n\nMore info on fuels and additives: ",
