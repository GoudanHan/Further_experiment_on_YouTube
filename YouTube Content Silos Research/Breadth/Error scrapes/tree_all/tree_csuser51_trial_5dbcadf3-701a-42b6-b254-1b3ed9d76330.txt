After a 40-year absence, The Joker invades Bruce Wayne's estate, revealing his knowledge of Wayne's past secret identity. The Joker nearly kills his nemesis, but Batman, alias Terry McGinnis, Wayne's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, saves Wayne's life for now. Pressured by Terry to divulge the truth, Commissioner Gordon retells the events of the night she witnessed the total annihilation of the psychopathic Joker. So how can the Clown Prince of Crime be alive? Will this inexperienced Batman meet The Joker's challenge? Bruce Wayne's life depends on it in the action-packed animated adventure Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker.",
