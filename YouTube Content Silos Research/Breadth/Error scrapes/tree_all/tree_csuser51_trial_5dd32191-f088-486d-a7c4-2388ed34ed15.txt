This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal. The last three were all awarded by the now-extinct government of the Republic of Vietnam.  He received the PUC and the two Vietnamese unit citations as a member of 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment.

He created a further 8 before his abdication in 1814. A few were aristocrats, but others were the sons of shopkeepers or tailors. The most favoured became princes and kings. Among their ranks were legendary figures such as Marshals Lannes, Ney, Soult, Davout and Mass\u00e9na, but also less well know figures like P\u00e9rignon, Brune and Moncey. Our series explores the lives of all 26 Marshals, and ranks them according to our own judgement of their achievements as Marshals. \n\nThank you to our series historical consultant Lt.Col.R\u00e9my Porte, whose blog on military history (in French) you can read here: ",

                        "description": "In 1813, following his disastrous invasion of Russia, Napoleon faced a desperate battle to save his empire. His enemies were gaining in strength, as Prussia and Sweden joined the Sixth Coalition against him, while Russian armies advanced across Poland and into Germany. The French Emperor worked miracles to raise a new Grande Arm\u00e9e of young conscripts, leading them to victory at L\u00fctzen and Bautzen. But Napoleon knew everything might ultimately depend on Austria - which side would his father-in-law,  Austrian Emperor Francis I, chose to support? The matter would be settled after a fateful and ill-tempered meeting in Dresden between Napoleon and Austrian foreign minister von Metternich...\n\nSpecial thanks to Alexander Averyanov for kind permission to use his paintings 'On the Frontier' & 'Horse Guards at the Battle of Borodino'.
