What is the origin of the universe? How are stars and planets created? Is there life elsewhere in the universe? Brian Greene brings together four scientists who will use the Webb to investigate these very questions: John C. Mather, NASA\u2019s lead scientist on the project and a Nobel Laureate; Natalie Batalha, NASA\u2019s lead scientist on the Kepler Mission, which discovered the first rocky planets outside our solar system; Adam Riess, who earned a Nobel Prize for his revelations about the expansion rate of the universe; and Ewine van Dishoeck, a Kavli Laureate for her pioneering work in the field of astrochemistry.\n \nThis program is part of the Big Ideas series, supported by the John Templeton Foundation.\n\nParticipants:\n- John C. Mather \n- Natalie Batalha\n- Adam Riess  \n- Ewine van Dishoeck \n\nModerator:\nBrian Greene \n \nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS on this program through a short survey: ",

What will it take to be able to peer back in time to an era when the first stars and galaxies came into existence or peer with unprecedented vision at planets around stars other than our Sun? Preparations for the first observations with the telescope are underway, and astronomers are eagerly anticipating the opportunity to propose science programs that will lead to a host of new discoveries.\n\nIn this lecture, Ken Sembach, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, will highlight some of the exciting science to be conducted in JWST\u2019s first year of observations. He will also provide a behind-the-scenes look at the complex science and flight operations activities needed to prepare the telescope and the astronomical community for an amazing journey across time and space.",

NASA and SpaceX continue to review launch opportunities and monitor weather conditions. Astronauts Kayla Barron, Raja Chari, and Thomas Marshburn of NASA will fly to the International Space Station alongside astronaut Matthias Maurer of the European Space Agency. Once there, the crew of four will spend about six months conducting science experiments and performing maintenance upgrades aboard the orbiting laboratory. For Barron, Chari, and Maurer, this will be their first spaceflight, and the third for Marshburn.\n\nLearn more about the mission: ",

What will it take to be able to peer back in time to an era when the first stars and galaxies came into existence or peer with unprecedented vision at planets around stars other than our Sun? Preparations for the first observations with the telescope are underway, and astronomers are eagerly anticipating the opportunity to propose science programs that will lead to a host of new discoveries.\n\nIn this lecture, Ken Sembach, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, will highlight some of the exciting science to be conducted in JWST\u2019s first year of observations. He will also provide a behind-the-scenes look at the complex science and flight operations activities needed to prepare the telescope and the astronomical community for an amazing journey across time and space.",

A lot, it turns out: the search for extraterrestrials requires the help from astronomers, planetary scientists, chemists, computer scientists, and geneticists, just to name a few. But are we barking up the wrong carbon-based tree? Could alien life develop in ways we haven't dreamed of here on Earth?
