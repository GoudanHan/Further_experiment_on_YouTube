Wilson is an assistant professor at the US Naval War College and an expert in 18th-century naval warfare. \n\nWilson discusses the accuracy of naval warfare scenes in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" (2003), starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley; \"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\" (2003), starring Russell Crowe; and \"Game of Thrones\" (2017). He comments on the reality of the combat in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" (2007), \"300: Rise of an Empire\" (2014), and \"The Adventures of Tintin\" (2011). Wilson also analyzes which sailing battle tactics are most accurate in \"Moana\" (2016), \"Admiral\" (2015), and \"Black Sails\" (2016).\n\nYou can learn more about Evan Wilson here:\nWebsite: ",

                        "description": "Former US submarine commander L. David Marquet rated the realism of submarine scenes in popular movies, judging their technological accuracy as well as the depiction of life on board.\n\nMarquet addresses the realism of nuclear crisis movies, such as \"The World Is Not Enough\" and \"K-19: The Widowmaker,\". He also rated the accuracy of standoff scenes in \"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"The Enemy Below\", \"Hunter Killer,\" and \"Crimson Tide.\" He also breaks down the realism of costumes, tactics, and terminology from \"U-571.\"\n\nIs life on board a submarine, including confined conditions and drills, as depicted in \"Das Boot\"? Would Navy SEALs enter a submarine from a HALO drop similar to \"Act of Valor\", and is it possible for a submarine to hear music from the water's surface, like in  \"The Wolf's Call\"? Can holes on a submarine be plugged with pins and other metal objects, as we see in \"The Simpsons\"? Would nuclear missiles be triggered by dislodging in a ship interior, such as in \"Aquaman\"?\n\nMarquet graduated top of his class from the US Naval Academy and served for 28 years on submarines, including as an engineer officer aboard the USS Will Rogers, then as captain on the USS Olympia and the USS Santa Fe. Having retired in 2009, he is now a Wall Street Journal best-selling author of \"Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders.\"\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?
