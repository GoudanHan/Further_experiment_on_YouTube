I hope you enjoy it! \n\nSummary:\n\nThe tragic events surrounding Colonel Russell Williams stunned all Canadians and none more so than the members of the Canadian Forces.\n\nIn October of 2009, Russell Williams was a 46-year-old commander of the largest and highest functioning air force base in Canada. Williams was a model military man and highly respected by his peers. \n\nHe had been described as an elite pilot over the course of his 23-year career. He had flown Queen Elizabeth, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Governor General of Canada, the Prime Minister of Canada, and many other dignitaries in the Canadian Forces VIP aircraft.\n\nHe seemed to be the perfect example of a military leader, but something sinister and deadly was lurking deep within him. In October of 2010, he pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of sexual assault and confinement, and 82 other counts of break and enter, and theft. \n\nWhen that news came out, it made the headlines across Canada and around the world for months; a man that Canada had placed in a senior position of trust and authority turned out to have a dark secret life as a deviant killer. \n\nOn February 7, 2010, Williams was asked to be present at the Ottawa Police Service headquarters.\n\nEven 10 years after the interrogation took place at the Ottawa police headquarters, the Russell Williams interrogation video still packs a massive punch. It captures a vividly emotional and intellectual game of cat and mouse between a seasoned investigator and a powerful yet terrifying man who is slowly realizing that his game is up, and there is no room to maneuver.\n\nCredits:\n\nMusic:\nLemmino",

And for many Democrats, it\u2019s obvious that Republicans are thwarting progress toward a more equal society.\n\nBut what happens when Republicans aren\u2019t standing in the way?\n\nIn many states \u2014 including California, New York and Illinois \u2014 Democrats control all the levers of power. They run the government. They write the laws. And as we explore in the video above, they often aren\u2019t living up to their values.\n\nIn key respects, many blue states are actually doing worse than red states. It is in the blue states where affordable housing is often hardest to find, there are some of the most acute disparities in education funding and economic inequality is increasing most quickly.\n\nInstead of asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d Democrats need to spend more time pondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with California?\u201d\n\nSubscribe: ",
