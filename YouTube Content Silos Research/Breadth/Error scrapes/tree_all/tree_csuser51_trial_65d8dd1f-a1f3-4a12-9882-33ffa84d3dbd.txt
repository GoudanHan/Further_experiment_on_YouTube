Lost World of the Maya surveys their dramatic rise to prominence in the 'pre-classic era' of the Maya as well as new evidence of the collapse of their civilization in the 800-900's AD.

A worsening climate combined with political upheaval, famine and economic difficulties to plunge the state into a dark era of civil war, with the land dividing into smaller city-states headed by ambitious small-town leaders. In an obscure tomb in Thebes, she uncovers the stories of warriors who fought in the bloody battle that would eventually lead to Egypt's reunification, and reveals how settlers known as the `Hyksos' tried to infiltrate the fledgling nation's government to seize the throne.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

This film shows why he was both feared and respected by his enemies. Hannibal\u2019s tactical genius is illustrated with the latest three-dimensional graphics technology and exciting dramatic reconstructions of his victories. This is the story of the General who took on the might of Rome. Hannibal led his forces, including a squadron of elephants, through France, over the Alps and into the heart of Italy. For 15 years he fought the Romans using their own country as his battlefield and his base. With his small forces, he destroyed larger well-trained Roman Armies with almost contemptuous ease. This feature length special also shows how Rome, after defeating Hannibal, destroyed the city of Carthage and attempted to wipe out an entire civilisation.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

In Outliers we\u0393\u00c7\u00d6re going to visit a genius who lives on a horse farm in Northern Missouri. We\u0393\u00c7\u00d6re going to examine the bizarre histories of professional hockey players and look into the peculiar childhood of Bill Gates and spend time in a Chinese rice paddy.  We will investigate the world\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s greatest law firm and wonder about what distinguishes pilots who crash planes from those who don\u0393\u00c7\u00d6t.

                "description": "This compilation of our Napoleonic Wars series covers the period from 1809 to the Emperor's abdication in 1814. Along the way we encounter the horrors of the French occupation of Spain and Portugal, Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia, and the great struggle for German in 1813. The series concludes with arguably Napoleon's finest campaign - his doomed defence of Paris in 1814. \n\nSupport Epic History TV on Patreon from $1 per video, and get perks including ad-free early access & votes on future topics ",
