                            "description": "Half a century ago, on 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong was in the final stages of the lunar descent, just a few thousand feet above the surface, when suddenly his on-board computer indicated a critical alarm. For three nail-biting seconds it looked as if the mission would have to be aborted. However, Armstrong was given a \"go\" to continue, and after several more alarms the Eagle touched down safely on the Moon.\n\nRobert Wills introduces the amazing hardware and software that made up the Apollo Guidance Computer, walks you through the landing procedure step-by-step, and talks about the pioneering design principles that were used to make the landing software robust against any failure. He also explains the problems that occurred during the Apollo 11 landing, and shows you how the Apollo Guidance Computer played its part in saving the mission.\n\nChapters:",

People confuse them sometimes, as that run is not counted towards the leaderboard and the runs on my Youtube all were. Any records on my Youtube were beaten a long time ago though! Really awesome for memories sake :) I don't speedrun competitively anymore, and the records you'll see on my channel were before speedrunning Minecraft competitively was a huge thing, so don't take these half decent times too seriously haha\n\nThis is a Minecraft World Record for Minecraft RANDOM SEED, glitches, on versions 1.9+.\n\nPrevious WR was ",

            "description": "This just in! Quantum physics tells us that consciousness creates reality! The physical realm is just a mental construct! This means you can heal yourself with your mind, you can manifest your desires, and you can commune with the universe to achieve ultimate transcendence! At least that's what some would have you believe. In actuality, physics says nothing of the sort. This is all just a ridiculous narrative spewed by con men that has come to be known as quantum mysticism. Together let's identify its origin, with figures like Deepak Chopra, and trace its development over the past few decades, culminating in YouTube channels like Spirit Science and Actualized.org, which go beyond mere pseudoscience and act as literal cults. Cults are bad, don't you agree? Let's expose and disarm them together.\n\nThanks to Chester Ho for help researching Actualized.org, check out his channel: ",
