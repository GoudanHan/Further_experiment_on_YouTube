Of course Spiff is going to be ignoring all of these updates and new secret societies game mode and instead playing the strangest and most challenging game of Civ 6 yet. The Spiffing Brit will be trying to win the Game without settling a city! Thats right a No City Win Only Challenge! Is it even possible to win a game without placing down your settler and getting one city. Well it turns out Spiff has found a way! So is Civ 6 a perfectly balanced game WITH NO EXPLOITS, Except for the maori and the no city challenge. So is spiff going for a conquest victory, science victory, tourism or perhaps a diplomatic victory! Who knows what he can even do HE DOESNT HAVE A CITY!!!! He cant research and he cant make any money so what can he do! I guess he has found a way to break the game so lets find out. Surely Civilization vi is a perfectly balanced game ;)\n\nSo sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Civilization 6 is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if the No City Only Challenge is broken!! How can you even win a game of civ without settling a city! This is almost 100X better than the civ 6 one city challenge videos ;)\n\nThis video game exploit video will be jam packed with a best bits funny moments montage style of editing similar to that of Valefisk, Robbaz and RTgame. So sit back relax and grab a cup of tea to enjoy with the spiffing brit! \n\nMagestic Merch: ",

                        "description": "Skyrim is the ultimate RPG game designed by Video Game God Todd Howard and Exploit Creators Bethesda. In Their divine wisdom they gave the players of skyrim the most overpowered mage build in terms of damage outputs in skyrim. We took the strongest spell in skyrim and decided to see if we could also add it to our 100% resistant to magic build that we would need to do the absorb Magic Only challenge again! AND THEN add an additional 12,000% damage to that spell thanks to the fortify restoration loop exploit!   So how on earth can a player beat skyrim with only a 100% Resistance To Magic a skill which is exceedingly limited and has few overpowered gameplay features alongside the most overpowered mage build in the universe... You can take a level 1 character and turn them into the most powerful character in the entirety of the elder scrolls universe by having them become immune to magic and have magic powers that can evaporate a dragon in 1 second. So lets see if The Spiffing Brit can prove if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game or if spiff can exploit skyrim and beat the game with only Magic. \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this Skyrim Magic only challenge! How on earth can one english bugger beat Skyrim Special Edition with only resisting spells and using the most powerful lightening imaginable!! Its the most overpowered build yet!  Is it really a Magic Challenge... I mean there is not much of a challenge when you can 1 hit every single enemy...\n\nmajestic merch: ",

So yes today we are going to break the game with the power of modern weapons! \n\nThis video is going to be packed with funny clips in a montage style of british humor!\nIf you enjoyed this then check out my other 100 stat man videos!\nIt is also rather similar to Robbaz , Valefisk and RT Game in style of content!\n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this skyrim challenge! \n\n\nPatreon: ",

This is the full release of the series in its 2 hour entirety like I promised. If you have already watched the 8 separate pieces then you have already seen it all, this does not add anything new. This is the video as it was presented to my patreon supporters more than a month ago. \n\nIt took me an entire month to do this, from the planning phase to script writing, all the way to the editing. It was a very lengthy process but i am very satisfied with the result and i hope you are too!

                    "description": "Skyrim is the ultimate RPG game designed by Video Game God Todd Howard and Exploit Creators Bethesda. In Their divine wisdom they gave the players of skyrim the most overpowered mage build in terms of damage outputs in skyrim. We took the strongest spell in skyrim and decided to see if we could also add it to our 100% resistant to magic build that we would need to do the absorb Magic Only challenge again! AND THEN add an additional 12,000% damage to that spell thanks to the fortify restoration loop exploit!   So how on earth can a player beat skyrim with only a 100% Resistance To Magic a skill which is exceedingly limited and has few overpowered gameplay features alongside the most overpowered mage build in the universe... You can take a level 1 character and turn them into the most powerful character in the entirety of the elder scrolls universe by having them become immune to magic and have magic powers that can evaporate a dragon in 1 second. So lets see if The Spiffing Brit can prove if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game or if spiff can exploit skyrim and beat the game with only Magic. \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this Skyrim Magic only challenge! How on earth can one english bugger beat Skyrim Special Edition with only resisting spells and using the most powerful lightening imaginable!! Its the most overpowered build yet!  Is it really a Magic Challenge... I mean there is not much of a challenge when you can 1 hit every single enemy...\n\nmajestic merch: ",

                "description": "In our latest Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim video we discuss what we believe is the MOST tragic city in all of Skyrim! Windhelm certainly looks cool, but after lots of thinking and consideration, we probably wouldn't want to spend much time there. In this video you will meet the faces of Windhelm, hear their stories, and perhaps get an insight into this Skyrim city that you may not have previously thought about. Just keep your wits about you, for Calixto could be lurking around any corner!\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series and was released worldwide on November 11, 2011. The game's main story revolves around the player character and their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The videogame is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. \n\nAt FudgeMuppet, we uncover the elder scrolls lore secrets that make this game so sensational, and in this video we're going to be diving into all of the events in Windhelm! We'll talk to the richest families and the poorest dock workers, piecing together their stories and building a picture of it all which proves that this city is sad no matter where you look. We do have many Skyrim mods on display which enhance the appearance of Skyrim's cities, and if you were to look at vanilla Skyrim, particularly the Gray Quarter, it is far less festive than shown in this video. If you think about it, this only strengthens the message of the video. It is also worth noting, which is talked about towards the end of the video, that even if you decide to take over the city with the Empire and wipe out the Stormcloaks, all you do is shift around the vibes and emotions in the city, as opposed to actually improving them.\n\nMERCH: ",

The Stormcloak cause is a controversial one, some see them as righteous liberators, restoring freedom to Skyrim - While others view them has a group of disorganized bandits with little legitimacy. However you see them, the Stormcloaks and their leader, Ulfric Stormcloak, are an iconic and influential force in the game. And like everything else in Skyrim Special Edition, there's quite a few Easter Eggs, tiny details and hidden facts surrounding them. So today we'll be taking a look at five things you (probably) didn't know about the Stormcloaks of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.",
