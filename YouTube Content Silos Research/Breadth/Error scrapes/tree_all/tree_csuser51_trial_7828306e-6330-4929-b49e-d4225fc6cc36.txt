                            "description": "After the surprise public impact of Sputnik 1, the satellite and launch teams were called back from vacation and in one month assembled Sputnik 2 (using equipment already developed for dog sounding rocket flights). The spacecraft, which remained attached to the upper stage, carried the dog Laika. No recovery was possible, and the dog perished in orbit due to higher-than-expected temperatures.\n\nThe life-support system and the consumables were designed for a 7-day flight. Control of the internal atmosphere was provided by a carbon dioxide absorbing device, an oxygen generator, an oxygen regulator, and a fan that activated when the cabin temperature went above 15 deg C. Food and water were ejected by tube directly into the stomach in jelly form, and wastes were removed by another implanted tube. Restraints kept Laika from moving far -- she could not even turn around. Her electrocardiogram, and data on respiration rate and maximum arterial pressure, were radioed to the ground when over the Soviet Union. Some kind of device (a crude television monitor?) allowed her movements in the cabin to be seen.\n\nThree dogs -- Albina, Laika and Mushka -- were involved in flight preparations. Albina was the back-up dog, and had survived earlier sounding rocket flights into space. Mushka was the stand-in for tests. All the dogs had been trained to survive in small cages in preparation for the flight. Laika was sealed into her cramped cabin four days before launch.\n\nDespite her ordeal on the ground she survived the launch and her heart rate returned to normal after a time. She had proven that an animal could survive in sustained spaceflight. But in practice the environmental control system was not up to the task. Telemetry showed that temperature and humidity increased relentlessly. By the fourth orbit none of the physiological sensors were returning data -- Laika had evidently died. This fact was not revealed until the 21st Century.",

                "description": "Flight to the Lights 2 was the second private chartered flight from New Zealand to fly south to the Antarctic circle with the aim to see and photograph the Aurora Australis, the southern lights. In 2017 a Boeing 767 was flown out of Dunedin, New Zealand, on the inaugural flight. \n\nThe plane departed Christchurch, New Zealand at 7.35pm on the 22nd of March, 2018, and landed at the same airport 10 hours later. The plane was a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Air New Zealand. Only the window seats were sold on the flight, in seated pairs. \n\nThe time lapse, taken on the starboard side of the aircraft, is slightly cut down from it's original duration of seven hours; due to taking the westward track down we were exposed to more daylight than expected, so the first hour of the time lapse was deemed unnecessary. \n\nOne second of time lapse = one minute of real time.\n\nSpecs:\nCamera: Sony a7S Mk1\nLens: ZEISS Batis 18mm f2.8\nDuration: 3.2\" exposures, 1 photo every 5 seconds.\nImages processed in Adobe Lightroom Classic CC and exported as a time lapse in Final Cut Pro 7. \n\nCamera was fixed in place and mounted on a tripod on a seat, secured with a combination of gaffer tape and low-tack tape for securing to the window. \n\nSpecial thanks must go to Ian Griffin and his staff of elves at the Otago Museum in Dunedin, Air New Zealand for providing the aircraft and extremely friendly and helpful flight crew, Orbit Travel Dunedin for organising the charter, NHNZ Ltd in Dunedin for the loan of my camera gear (and Braydon for the awesome ZEISS lens!), Jonathan's Photo Warehouse for graciously providing some camera bodies and lenses for passengers to use, plus Stephen, Taichi and Paul for helping to organise and run the successful event. \n\nTo use this video in a commercial player or in broadcasts, please email licensing@storyful.com",

TikTok is trash because Tiktok makes money from your misery. Tiktok is garbage because it is funding China's 2049 plan. CCP's Bytedance is making billions of dollars from AI technology that is ruining society. Tiktok makes money by destroying society and culture. Tiktokers are making millions of dollars and making lots of money from selling out to the business of China's Bytedance which is why Tiktok is bad and Tiktok is trash.\n\nSupport the channel here (all funds go back into the channel):\n\u25ba  Become a Patron:  ",
