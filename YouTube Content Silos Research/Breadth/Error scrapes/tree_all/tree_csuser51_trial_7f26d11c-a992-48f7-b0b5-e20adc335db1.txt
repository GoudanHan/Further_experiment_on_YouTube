Documentary Filmmaker, The Red Pill \n\nCassie Jaye founded Jaye Bird Productions in 2008, which has since produced a  collection  of documentary films that have been praised for being thought-provoking, entertaining and respectful in representing multiple competing views within each film. Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye\u2019s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.",

Craig is one of the world\u2019s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the \u201cnew atheism\u201d movement. \n\nIn front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christ\u2019s resurrection. It was a compelling clash of worldviews and an examination of the major arguments for and against Christianity and atheism.",
