Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.\n\nIn this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u2019s original holy city \u2013 as detailed in the Qur\u2019an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u2019s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u2018forbidden gathering place\u2019. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.\n\nIn the film \u2018The Sacred City\u2019 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u2013 while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.\n\nWhile clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u2019s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u2019an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.\n\nIn a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.\n\nBeautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

History is now repeating itself around the world.\n\nBased on a book by Professor Richard Werner, a visiting researcher at the Bank of Japan during the 90s crash, during which the stock market dropped by 80% and house prices by up to 84%. The film uncovers how the Bank of Japan pumped up and then crashed the Japanese economy, with an aim of inducing change. Today, what happened in Japan 25 years ago is repeating itself in Europe, with an aim of centralising power in the Eurozone.\n\nThe film shows why it is important for central banks to be accountable and transparent. It also explains how International Financial Organisations such as the IMF seek to impose conditions on countries that are mainly of benefit to dominant Western interests. For anyone interested in understanding recent developments and the significance of the establishment of institutions such as the AIIB and the BRICS led New Development Bank, Princes of the Yen provides the background.\n\nPrinces of the Yen reveals with clarity the control levers that underpin the dominant ideology of the 21st Century. Piece by piece, reality is deconstructed to reveal the world as it is, not as those in power would like us to believe that it is.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

He is the originator and popularizer of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology and science in general, including funny enough the introduction of the word meme in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which in the context of a gene-centered view of evolution is an exceptionally powerful idea. He is outspoken, bold, and often fearless in his defense of science and reason, and in this way, is one of the most influential thinkers of our time.\n\nPS: There is some occasional noise in the audio, which I tried to clean up in the edit.\n\nSupport this podcast by signing up with these sponsors:\n- Cash App - use code \"LexPodcast\" and download:\n- Cash App (App Store): ",

A lot, it turns out: the search for extraterrestrials requires the help from astronomers, planetary scientists, chemists, computer scientists, and geneticists, just to name a few. But are we barking up the wrong carbon-based tree? Could alien life develop in ways we haven't dreamed of here on Earth?

We were sipping cocktails in the art-deco building with string theorist and science superstar Robbert Dijkgraaf as he told us all about the fundamental laws of Nature. Afterwards, cellist and composer Benjamin Glorieux performed a musical piece together with invited guests especially commissioned for the occasion, while live-video artist Klaas Verpoest accompanied them with his visual magic.\n\nWhat is string theory? What happens to stuff that falls inside a black hole? What are the fundamental building blocks of space and time? Did Nature have any choice in picking the fundamental laws of physics? What is the role of mathematics in physics?\n\nThis talk by professor Robbert Dijkgraaf was recorded on 13 July 2019 at Flagey in Brussels.

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

When it comes to saving humanity from an asteroid impact, Tyson stressed that rather than establishing colonies in space, we would be better to try to deflect the asteroid.\n\n\u062a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0646\u064a\u0644 \u062f\u064a\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646\u060c \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0643\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0639\u062b\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u064f\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629\u064b \u0625\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0623\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u062f\u0641\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u062a\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u063a\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0627. \u0648\u0641\u064a \u063a\u064a\u0627\u0628 \u0636\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635\u060c \u062a\u062a\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0645\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0645\u062c \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062c\u0644\u060c \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0628\u064f\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0623\u0648 \u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a. \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0648\u0629 \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u0637\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0643\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u062d\u0633\u0628\u064b\u0627 \u0644\u0623\u064a \u062f\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0642\u062f \u064a\u062d\u0644\u0651 \u0628\u0643\u0648\u0643\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0646\u062a\u064a\u062c\u0629 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636\u0647 \u0644\u0627\u0635\u0637\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u064a\u0632\u0643\u060c \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0632\u0643 \u064a\u0638\u0644 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am.
