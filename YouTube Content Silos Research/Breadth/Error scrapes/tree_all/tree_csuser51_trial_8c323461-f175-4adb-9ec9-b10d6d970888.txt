These seemingly intelligently controlled craft are operating above the clouds, in our oceans and in our orbit \u2013 travelling at hypersonic speeds far beyond any known human technology and completing manoeuvres unknown to science. \n\nThe subject of conspiracy and derision for years, UFOs are now the hottest topic in Washington and the world.\n\nFive-time Walkley Award-winning investigative journalist Ross Coulthart \u2013 who has been investigating the phenomena for the past two years \u2013 led the 7NEWS Spotlight team across the US, amassing never-before-seen compelling evidence and speaking to the key players behind an event that will change the course of history. \n\nFeaturing interviews with the highest echelons of military defence and intelligence officials, leading researchers, scientists and witnesses in America and Australia, this mind-blowing documentary years in the making seeks to answer the most fundamental question there is: are we alone? \n\nThe US director of national intelligence is expected to hand down an unclassified report next month that will change our understanding of life itself. On Spotlight, we reveal what is in that report. \n\n7NEWS Spotlight: The UFO Phenomenon unearths startling new evidence of Australian Government cover-ups and extraordinary vision of unidentified aerial phenomena in Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland \u2013 all credible and important additions to the worldwide data being accumulated by the US. \n\nFor Coulthart, the project has become the most fascinating and challenging of his career, becoming the focus of his new book 'In Plain Sight', available now in Australia and soon in other territories:\n\nAustralia: ",

        "description": "Attorney Marilyn York owns a Men\u2019s Rights Family Law Firm in Reno Nevada, established in 2001. She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",
