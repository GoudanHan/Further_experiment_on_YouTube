Warmbier was released the following year, but he died of brain damage shortly after his return to the United States. Was he really the victim of torture?\n\nOtto Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2016 after being convicted of attempting to steal a propaganda poster during a trip to Pyongyang. Just over a year on he was dead, having been sent home to the US in a vegetative state. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been \"tortured beyond belief \" in North Korea. The US president blamed both the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the Obama administration for Warmbier\u2019s death - and Trump appeared before the media with the student\u2019s parents. This was at the peak of the North Korean missile crisis. Later, as relations between Trump and Kim Jong Un became warmer, the US president changed his tune. In 2019 Trump said that he believed that Kim did not know what happened to the US student much to the consternation of Warmbier\u2019s parents. \n\nWhat really happened to Otto Warmbier in North Korea? Veteran foreign correspondent Klaus Scherer sets out to try to find out. In the documentary, Scherer interviews a number of people with knowledge of the case who have been largely unheard up to now. He shows that a US court investigating a liability case against North Korea brought by Warmbier\u2019s parents also ignored important witnesses, who continue to cast doubt on the torture allegations. These include the coroner in Cincinnati who examined Warmbier\u2019s body. She believes that the account given by North Korean doctors is credible. They claim that Warmbier had inadvertently been given too high a dose of sedatives by prison staff. This, the medics say was the cause of his state of unresponsive wakefulness. Could Trump\u2019s initial torture charges simply have been motivated by political opportunism?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It seemed too good to be true\u2014and was, as Carreyrou, a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning Wall Street Journal reporter, revealed in a series of detailed articles. Undaunted by pressure from the company\u2019s CEO and lawyers, Carreyrou raised enough doubts about Theranos policies, procedures, and promises that by 2015 Holmes and her corporation were being investigated by a host of medical authorities, investors, state attorneys general, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and others.

Was Khashoggi so much of a threat to the Saudi regime that it was prepared to commit a terrible crime to get rid of him?\n\nThis documentary reconstructs Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s personal plans and movements in his final days. It also examines records, leaks and reports related to his assassination, as well as motivations that may have led Saudi Arabia to commit such a shocking crime.\n\nThe film\u2019s key feature is exclusive testimony from Khashoggi\u2019s close circle, including from his fianc\u00e9e Hatice Cengiz. She tells of her emotional struggle in dealing with his death; hoping against hope he was still alive despite accounts of how he was killed; the struggle to discover his fate; and the pain of not knowing where his body is.\n\nThe documentary also uncovers how the Saudi government handed the incident, including the attempts it made to cover up the story. In London, Washington, Istanbul and Montreal, the film visits and speaks with Khashoggi\u2019s friends, security experts, analysts and activists. The events surrounding Khashoggi's killing and the assassination itself are reconstructed in reenactments and with aerial photographs, graphics and animations, including archive footage. In the words of one official close to the case, UN Special Rapporteur Agn\u00e8s Callamard: \"There is credible evidence that requires further investigation into the involvement of senior Saudi officials in the crime, including the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "description": "Cyan Worlds co-founder Rand Miller goes behind the scenes of the development of one of the best selling PC games of all time, Myst. The HyperCard-developed title ran into some snags when trying to run on the CD-ROM format. \"I had a really powerful Mac, with a lot of memory and a lot of hard drive space, and we were still working in mud,\" said Rand, discussing the game's performance early-on. Rand and his brother, Robyn, compressed the image and audio data as much as they could so the game could run smoothly on 1x CD-ROM drives.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
