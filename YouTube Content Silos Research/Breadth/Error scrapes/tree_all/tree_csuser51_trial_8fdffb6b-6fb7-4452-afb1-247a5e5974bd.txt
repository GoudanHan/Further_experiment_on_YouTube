The gang smokes marijuana, plays with guns, and sells crack and heroin for six weeks, completely unaware that their every move is being recorded.\n\nCustomers come and go, unaware that their private lives are being revealed. This is an intimate portrait of a crack house's rise and fall, as well as a drug-addled American urban culture. Interviews with gang members, their friends, and police disclose the unavoidable tragedy - and the occasional dark humour - of a reality that exists underneath the surface of any major community.\n\nFrom Crack House USA \n\nTwitter: ",

He says that the illegal rave scene in the UK and lack of funding as a university student drove him to sell drugs on a larger scale. Pieter's operation eventually supplied many big time dealers in the UK. He then began importing cocaine from Ecuador to Europe through a cartel connection. Pieter was arrested in Ecuador and sentenced to 12 years in one of the worlds most violent and corrupt prisons. He now works as a public speaker on the dangers of drugs, and also presents a show on local radio station \u201cincapable staircase\u201d every Friday from 4-5:30 pm GMT.",
