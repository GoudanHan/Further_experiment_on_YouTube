A show and podcast about big ideas and how they came to be. \n\nIn this episode, I get to chat with four amazing friends who happen also be the producers of the show Impractical Jokers that runs on TBS. I caught up with the Jokers, Sal, Murr, Q, and Joe just as they were beginning shooting for Season 8 and right before the launch of their first feature film.\n\nDuring this episode, we hear directly from the guys just how they developed the show, the multiple failures they had on the way, and of course their moment of Eureka.\n\nLet me know what you think and also subscribe for more interviews like this.",
