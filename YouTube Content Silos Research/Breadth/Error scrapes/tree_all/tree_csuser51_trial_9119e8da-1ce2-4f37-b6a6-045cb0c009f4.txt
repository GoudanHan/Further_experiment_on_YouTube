KC is a card-counter, and so he has been banned from multiple casinos across the country, and this forces him to disguise himself to get into certain establishments. It is not a one-way street either, as many casinos blatantly break the law when dealing with KC.\n\nSubscribe to WONDER to watch more documentaries: ",

This documentary goes behind the scenes at Prestige and discovers that, when it comes to upmarket pawn, everyone has a story to tell. Headed up by slick former property developer James Constantinou, and with a quirky team of asset experts including salt-of-the-earth jewellery expert Lawrence and feisty PA Jo, Prestige is the go-to place for people who want fast cash in well-heeled Surrey, pawning everything from million-pound helicopters to Lambourghinis and \u00a325,000 Hermes handbags. And it's an empire on the move: James is taking big risks investing in a new store in Richmond and has bigger plans too. But will expanding make or break the business? \n\n\nFrom Posh Pawn \n\nSubscribe To Trade Off: The home of all things trade!

Our host Frank Pinello, a born and bred Brooklynite, remembers the importance of his neighborhood pizzeria growing up. We start at Roberta's in Bushwick, a pizzeria that has truly changed an entire neighborhood. Then we spend some time with Mark Iacono, owner of Lucali in Carroll Gardens, who built his restaurant by hand and is working tirelessly to preserve the tradition of his neighborhood through pizza. And what would any pizza show be without visiting the king: Dom DeMarco of Di Fara in Midwood? Dom is a legend, and even when great pizzaiolos visit him, like Frank and Mark, they can end up questioning their own pies.\n\nWATCH NEXT:\nChef's Night Out with Paulie Gee's: ",
