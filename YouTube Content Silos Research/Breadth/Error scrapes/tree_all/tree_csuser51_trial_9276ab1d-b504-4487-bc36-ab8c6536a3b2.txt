                        "description": "Professor Jim Al-Khalili traces the story of arguably the most important, accurate and yet perplexing scientific theory ever: quantum physics.\n\nThe story of quantum physics starts at the beginning of the 20th century with scientists trying to better understand how light bulbs work. This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.\n\nAlbert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s. Professor Al-Khalili repeats this critical experiment, posing the question does reality really exist, or do we conjure it into existence by the act of observation?\n\nElsewhere, we explore how the most famous law of quantum physics \u2013 The Uncertainty Principle \u2013 is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis. Could quantum mechanics explain the greatest mystery in biology - evolution?\n\nContent Provided By TVF International.

But there have never been recommended limits for sugar on Canadian food labels, despite emerging research that suggests the sweet stuff may be making more of us fat and sick. In the fifth estate\u2019s season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science \u2014 and the reaction from the food industry \u2014 to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?\n\nA small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nWe put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists \u2013 and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.\n\nOriginal airdate : October 4th, 2013\n\nFor more on the fifth estate : ",
