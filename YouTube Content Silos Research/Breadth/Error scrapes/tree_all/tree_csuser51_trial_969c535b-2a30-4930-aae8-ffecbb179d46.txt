The US mafia is featured in many classic movies from the 1920s onwards. We discuss the cultural significance and accuracy of famous crime scenes in movies and TV shows, such as \"The Godfather\" and \"The Sopranos.\" Franzese also points out inaccuracies in scenes from mob comedies such as \"Analyze This\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nFranzese discusses true stories and real-life characters featured in \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino.\" He talks about his proximity to the events of Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman,\" the Oscar-nominated movie starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. \n\nAfter Franzese was released from prison in 1995, he became the only high ranking official of a major mafia family to ever walk away, without protective custody, and survive. Franzese is the author of \"Blood Covenant\" and \"I\u2019ll Make You An Offer You Can\u2019t Refuse.\" He now works as a public speaker and motivator.\n\nMORE 'HOW REAL IS IT?':\n\nExplosives Expert Rates Movie Explosions: ",

In the video, Williams analyzes scenes where money is being laundered through businesses. Another form of money laundering is simply spending more than $10,000 of illegally-obtained funds. \n\nWilliams served as an FBI special agent for 26 years, working on major economic fraud investigations. She is the recipient of four United States Attorney Awards for Distinguished Service. She now hosts the true-crime podcast \"FBI Retired Case File Review\" and works as a technical consultant for TV shows and movies depicting the FBI. \n\nWilliams is the author of \"FBI Myths and Misconceptions: A Manual for Armchair Detectives\": ",

He says he robbed over 100 banks across California between 1999 and 2001. He eventually turned himself in and served nine years in prison after pleading guilty to six robberies. He now works as a life coach and motivational speaker, helping newly released prisoners reintegrate into society. He's also a partner in two production companies. \n\nAnyone who has been affected by violent crime can contact the National Center for Victims of Crime on 1 (202) 467-8700 or ",

                    "description": "Former US submarine commander L. David Marquet rated the realism of submarine scenes in popular movies, judging their technological accuracy as well as the depiction of life on board.\n\nMarquet addresses the realism of nuclear crisis movies, such as \"The World Is Not Enough\" and \"K-19: The Widowmaker,\". He also rated the accuracy of standoff scenes in \"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"The Enemy Below\", \"Hunter Killer,\" and \"Crimson Tide.\" He also breaks down the realism of costumes, tactics, and terminology from \"U-571.\"\n\nIs life on board a submarine, including confined conditions and drills, as depicted in \"Das Boot\"? Would Navy SEALs enter a submarine from a HALO drop similar to \"Act of Valor\", and is it possible for a submarine to hear music from the water's surface, like in  \"The Wolf's Call\"? Can holes on a submarine be plugged with pins and other metal objects, as we see in \"The Simpsons\"? Would nuclear missiles be triggered by dislodging in a ship interior, such as in \"Aquaman\"?\n\nMarquet graduated top of his class from the US Naval Academy and served for 28 years on submarines, including as an engineer officer aboard the USS Will Rogers, then as captain on the USS Olympia and the USS Santa Fe. Having retired in 2009, he is now a Wall Street Journal best-selling author of \"Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders.\"\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

Here, he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from jungle-warfare movies and rates them based on their accuracy. \n\nMason reviews classic Hollywood movies such as \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), \"Platoon\" (1986), \"Tears of the Sun\" (2003), \"Forrest Gump\" (1994), and \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002). He also rates the realism of the HBO miniseries \"The Pacific\" (2010).How reasonable are the jungle tactics in \"Predator\" (1987)? Does Christian Bale use the correct method for jungle helicopter rescue in \"Rescue Dawn\" (2006)? How realistic are the stealth and sniping tactics in \"Sniper\" (1993)? And would the camouflage Sylvester Stallone uses in \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" (1985) be successful? The Jungle Operations Training Course in Hawaii is a 12-day program for US Army regiments that covers mobility training, waterborne operations, combat tracking, jungle tactics, and survival training. Students learn tactics, techniques, and procedures required to fight, win, and survive. There are 10 courses a year for regular active-duty soldiers, Marines, sailors, and airmen, and menu-based training for Special Operations. Mason has been involved in the course since 2014 and became the senior instructor in 2018. \n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?
