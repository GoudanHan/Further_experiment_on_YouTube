Turning the game into a blended platformer with some RPG elements lead to a very creative Mario game.

Luigi, your own brother, gets brainwashed and because a villain known as Mr. L.

            "description": "I know that I've become known for my flat earth destructions, but now that I've driven that one so far into the ground that it's coming out the other side of the spherical earth, it's time to tackle some other topics. There exists an obscure fad called the electric universe, which tends to attract exemplars of the Dunning-Kruger effect who think they understand physics better than Einstein. Literally.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
