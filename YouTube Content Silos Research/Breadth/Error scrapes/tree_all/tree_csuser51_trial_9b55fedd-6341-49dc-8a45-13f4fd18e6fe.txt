Most lawyers do.  It is just a great movie that involves great lawyering.  Everyone should watch this movie.  But the question is: Is Vinny Gambini a good lawyer?  We'll find out today.\n\nThe movies starts with two students driving through the South on their way to California. Once they arrive in Alabama, they stop at a local convenience store to pick up a few snacks. The store clerk is murdered just after they leave and, in a case of mistaken identity, they are fingered for the crime.  Facing execution, the students do not have enough money for a lawyer, so they hire their cousin, Vincent Laguardia Gambini (Joe Pesci). After failing the bar 5 times, Vinny has been a lawyer for about six weeks and has to learn the process on the job.  Vinny has to defend his clients and battle an uncompromising judge, some tough locals, and even his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei).   \n\n(Thanks to Indochino for sponsoring this video and helping to make this channel possible)\n\nNew episodes weekly!

Most lawyers do.  It is just a great movie that involves great lawyering.  Everyone should watch this movie.  But the question is: Is Vinny Gambini a good lawyer?  We'll find out today.\n\nThe movies starts with two students driving through the South on their way to California. Once they arrive in Alabama, they stop at a local convenience store to pick up a few snacks. The store clerk is murdered just after they leave and, in a case of mistaken identity, they are fingered for the crime.  Facing execution, the students do not have enough money for a lawyer, so they hire their cousin, Vincent Laguardia Gambini (Joe Pesci). After failing the bar 5 times, Vinny has been a lawyer for about six weeks and has to learn the process on the job.  Vinny has to defend his clients and battle an uncompromising judge, some tough locals, and even his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei).   \n\n(Thanks to Indochino for sponsoring this video and helping to make this channel possible)\n\nNew episodes weekly!
