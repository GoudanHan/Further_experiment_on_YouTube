He breaks down long-range-sniping scenes featuring Will Smith in \"Gemini Man\" (2019) and Mark Wahlberg in \"Shooter\" (2007). \nHe also looks at modern-day war movies set in Iraq and Afghanistan, such as \"American Sniper\" (2014), \"Jarhead\" (2005), \"Lone Survivor\" (2013), and \"The Hurt Locker\" (2009).
