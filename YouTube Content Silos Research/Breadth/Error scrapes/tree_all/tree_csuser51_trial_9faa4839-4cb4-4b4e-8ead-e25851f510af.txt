Yet, the sole hope for triumph over evil lies with a brave hobbit, Frodo, who, accompanied only by his loyal friend Sam and the hideous, wretched Gollum, ventures deep into the very dark heart of Mordor on his seemingly impossible quest to destroy the Ring of Power.",

I got frustrated with the limitations of my voice, so I decided to take a few voice lessons. A friend of mine introduced me to his old vocal coach, Neil Semer. I thought we\u2019d be working on scales and practicing breathing. But after a couple of lessons, Neil turned to me and said, \u201cI think you\u2019re afraid of your masculinity.\u201d That wasn\u2019t territory I expected my voice teacher to cover. But it hit home. I was afraid of things we often associate with masculinity (even if women possess them too) \u2013 aggression, competitiveness, toughness. I realized I wasn\u2019t just frustrated with my singing voice; I was frustrated with where I had ended up in life. I felt unaccomplished, powerless, a guy who couldn\u2019t defend or assert himself. I thought I was proud of being the \u201csensitive\u201d guy but now I saw I had conflicted feelings about being the \u201csoftie.\u201d I also started to see that in rejecting old-school macho manliness, I had failed to tap into any authentic masculine part of myself. Clearly I had a lot of baggage around being manly. And when I talked to friends about this, I realized that just about every guy I knew had his own baggage. Very few men I knew related to the old model of manhood, but very few could fathom what would replace it. How should men be men, if all the old ways of defining manhood no longer seemed relevant to our 21st century lives? As a documentary filmmaker, I was used to pointing my camera at other people, but this time I felt like the only way to get the access and intimacy I wanted to explore the emotional landscape of masculinity was to make myself the subject. So for over six years, I filmed my own life. It turned out to be a momentous six years. I met my wife and we had two sons. I did a lot of work to heal my relationships with members of my family. And I did things for the film that seemed like a lark \u2013I went on a men\u2019s weekend, I went to see a life coach, I went hunting \u2013 and each in their own way transformed my life, and the story I wo",

Most lawyers do.  It is just a great movie that involves great lawyering.  Everyone should watch this movie.  But the question is: Is Vinny Gambini a good lawyer?  We'll find out today.\n\nThe movies starts with two students driving through the South on their way to California. Once they arrive in Alabama, they stop at a local convenience store to pick up a few snacks. The store clerk is murdered just after they leave and, in a case of mistaken identity, they are fingered for the crime.  Facing execution, the students do not have enough money for a lawyer, so they hire their cousin, Vincent Laguardia Gambini (Joe Pesci). After failing the bar 5 times, Vinny has been a lawyer for about six weeks and has to learn the process on the job.  Vinny has to defend his clients and battle an uncompromising judge, some tough locals, and even his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei).   \n\n(Thanks to Indochino for sponsoring this video and helping to make this channel possible)\n\nNew episodes weekly!

            "description": "Tobias Capwell is the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. Here, he reacts to seven memorable scenes featuring medieval weapons and armor and rates them based on their historical accuracy. \n\nCapwell looks at armor and weapons within fantasy franchises, such as Eomer's helmet in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" (2002).  Using artifacts from The Wallace Collection, Capwell addresses the realism of knightly combat in \"Henry V\" (1944), \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" (2005) and \"Game of Thrones\" (2011). Does chain mail look anything like it does in Netflix's \"Outlaw King\" (2018)? And would armor deflect arrows as in \"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\" (1999)? \n\nTobias Capwell is an author, lecturer, broadcaster, and the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. He has been a horseman and martial artist since childhood, is a founding member of the modern historical jousting community, and has fought in major international tournaments all over the world. Capwell has written many books and articles on weapons, armor, tournaments, and knighthood, including \"Armour of the English Knight 1400-1450,\" \"Arms and Armour of the Medieval Joust,\" and \"Masterpieces of European Arms and Armour in the Wallace Collection.\" In 2015 he had the honor of serving as one of the two fully armored knights who escorted the remains of King Richard III from the battlefield at Bosworth to their final resting place in Leicester Cathedral.\n\nFind out more about The Wallace Collection here: ",

Here, he reacts to 11 memorable scenes featuring medieval weapons and armor and rates them based on their historical accuracy. \n\nCapwell looks at armor and weapons within fantasy franchises, such as Sauron's armor in the battle of Orodruin in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001).  He addresses how helmets in \"The Mandalorian\" (2019) are influenced by Greek and Corinthian styles. Using artifacts from The Wallace Collection, Capwell addresses the realism of flails and maces as seen in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003). And he rates how realistic shields and swords are in \"Vikings\" (2014) and \"The Last Kingdom\" (2015). \n\nIs it possible to reforge swords, as seen in \"Game of Thrones\" (2011)? And how difficult would it be to fight in mud in full armor, like Robert Pattinson and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet do in \"The King\" (2019)?

Does sarin gas release the way it's shown in \"The Rock\" (1996)? And would a bathtub protect you from an explosion such as in \"Lethal Weapon 2\" (1989)? \n\nDavies led specialist teams in Iraq and Afghanistan as one of the British Army's leading bomb-disposal and weapons-intelligence experts. As an advanced IEDD operator, he also trained deployable EOD teams and served as the principal bomb-disposal operator within the UK's premier counterterrorism unit. He was the military advisor to the Ministry of Defence's Special Projects Search and Countermeasures delivery team and remains an internationally recognized authority on CT bomb disposal and defense robotics.\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nPhysicist Rates 11 'Fast And Furious' Movie Stunts | How Real Is It?",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
