Rocked by explosive decompression, the pilots fight to control the plane as the cabin and cockpit fill with heavy fog.\n\nUnable to descend to a safer altitude and with their emergency oxygen running out, they are flying straight out to sea in a plane on the verge of tearing itself apart. The pilots bring the plane to within a few hundred feet of the runway, but quickly realize that they are travelling too fast. \n\nOnce on the ground, the plane\u2019s tremendous speed is more than the emergency brakes can handle. They burst into flames. The plane then veers off the runway, runs into a ditch and comes to a grinding stop. After a six-hour ordeal, the crew has safely landed the crippled plane, saving the lives of everyone on board.\n\nWant to see more Mayday Air Disaster episodes in full? Watch them here: ",

A few minutes later, all four engines flame out. The St. Elmo's fire and engine flame-outs were caused by volcanic ash spewed by Galunggung in Indonesia during a major eruption. St. Elmo's fire is a weather phenomenon in which luminous plasma is created by a corona discharge from a rod-like object such as the leading edges of airplanes, as in the case of British Airways Flight 9. \n\nSubscribe to WONDER to watch more documentaries: ",

As tensions mounted in the pacific, the importance of breaking the enigmatic cypher became all the more pressing.

                "description": "The Spartans chronicles the rise and fall of one of the most extreme civilisations the world has ever witnessed. A civilization that was founded on discipline, sacrifice and frugality where the onus was on the collective and the goal was to create the perfect state, and the perfect warrior.  Classical historian Bettany Hughes reveals the secrets and complexities of everyday Spartan life: homosexuality was compulsory, money was outlawed, equality was enforced, weak boys were put to death and women enjoyed a level of social and sexual freedom that was unheard of in the ancient world. It was a nation of fearsome fighters where a glorious death was treasured. This can be aptly demonstrated by the kamikaze last stand at Thermopylae, where King Leonidas and his warriors fought with swords, hands and teeth to fend off the Persian invaders and show the rest of the world what it meant to be Spartan.    Sparta was ruthlessly militaristic and founded on a belief that good order and justice protected against chaos and lawlessness. Policed by secret spies the society was supported by a nation of slaves so all Spartan men had to do was fight. Boys were indoctrinated with the Spartan code of death and glory, separated from their mothers at seven and left to fend for themselves. It led Aristotle to comment that Sparta \"turned its children into animals.\" The training continued throughout adolescence, the most able boys being let loose as death squads preying on the slave population to keep them quiet.  It cannot lay claim to the philosophers or artists of Athens but Sparta contributed as much to western civilisation as Athens did. Indeed it was Sparta, not Athens that was the first city to offer citizenship to its inhabitants. To many, the ideals formed 2500 years ago in Sparta can be seen as a fore-runner of modern-day totalitarianism.  By setting out to create a perfect society protected by perfect warriors, Sparta made an enemy of change. A collapsing birth-rate, too few warriors, rebellious slaves, and outdated attitudes to weaponry and warfare combined to sow the seeds of Sparta's destruction. Eventually the once great warrior state was reduced to a stop for Roman tourists who came to view the bizarre sado-masochistic rituals. Documentary first broadcast in 2003.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

A duel of false promises, evasion and delusion ensued, which was far removed from the more familiar image of friendship and loyalty. World War II was not only a military conflict. It was also a series of private psychological battles waged by the four great leaders: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. In these mental duels, the 'warlords' lied, schemed, charmed, flattered and cheated to win. \n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
