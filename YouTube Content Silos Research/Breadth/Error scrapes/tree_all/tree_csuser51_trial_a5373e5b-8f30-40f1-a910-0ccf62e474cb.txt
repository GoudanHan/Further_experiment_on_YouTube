The Legacy manages to make a safe landing at an airbase, but the Gol jet crashes with no survivors. Air traffic controllers had cleared both aircraft to fly at the same altitude in opposite directions, and the Legacy's transponder was switched off, making both aircraft's traffic collision avoidance systems useless in preventing the collision.\n\nSubscribe to WONDER to watch more documentaries: ",

                    "description": "Sit back as we bring to you a mega marathon showcasing some of the worst plane crashes of all time here on Mayday! \u2708\ufe0f\n\nWhat has been your favorite episode of Mayday?\n\nFull episodes included are:\n\nSeason 5 Episode 3 \"Behind Closed Doors\": June 12, 1972 \u2013 The crew of American Airlines flight 96 is preparing their brand new DC-10 for the short flight from Detroit, Michigan, to Buffalo, New York. A billion-dollar investment by manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, this plane is the latest advance in passenger jets. It\u2019s so new that neither the pilot nor the co-pilot has more than 75 hours of experience flying the aircraft.  Within minutes of take-off, an explosion rips a gaping hole in the cabin. While the plane begins to fall from the sky, the pilots struggle to safely land the crippled aircraft. \n\nThe badly damaged Flight 96 plane roars back to the Detroit airport. After a harrowing touchdown, the jet comes to a stop just 300 meters from the end of the runway.  As investigators search the damaged plane for clues, they quickly conclude that the design of the DC-10\u2019s rear cargo door is to blame as the locking device is faulty. They also discover that it\u2019s possible for baggage handlers to believe the door is properly locked when it isn\u2019t. Investigators recommend several changes that could be made to make the door safe. \n\nSeason 5 Episode 7 \"Explosive Evidence\": June 23, 1985 \u2014 Air India Flight 182 is cruising over the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 on its way from Canada to India. Air traffic controllers in Shannon, Ireland are monitoring the flight when suddenly its signal disappears from their screens. Search and rescue crews are quickly dispatched to scour the North Atlantic for the plane. Within hours, pieces of the aircraft and bodies are found scattered on the ocean surface.  All 329 people on board the 747 are dead. \n\nInvestigators begin the painstaking process of unravelling the mysterious tragedy.  The wreckage is spread over nine square miles off the ocean floor. This is a vital clue for investigators as It tells them that the plane disintegrated at a great height. Investigators soon suspect the aircraft was brought down by a mid-air explosion. Investigators horrifying conclusions lead to major improvements in the way luggage is screened, and to stricter regulations for forwarding luggage on connecting flights. The quality of training for security guards also comes under scrutiny and continues to be an area of concern for security experts.\n\nSeason 5 Episode 2 \"Glimi Glider\": July 23, 1983 - It\u2019s a calm summer evening. Air Canada flight 143 is on its way to Edmonton from Montreal. Captain Bob Pearson and First Officer Maurice Quintal are both veteran pilots, but they\u2019re flying a new automated Boeing 767.  Midway through the flight, things begin to go horribly wrong. The plane is in danger of running out of fuel. Pearson decides to land as soon as possible. He heads for Winnipeg. As he descends he loses one engine, then another.\n\nBut the only way for Pearson to get his plane safely down is to try a manoeuvre that only glider pilots would know about. Bob Pearson flies gliders in his spare time and forces the plane into a sideways free fall. It\u2019s called a sideslip. As Pearson touches down, his front landing gear collapsed, his rear tires blow. The first-ever 767 to land without engines does so without so much as a single serious injury. \n\nAfter successfully landing the first-ever Boeing 767 without engines, investigators quickly discover that a faulty computer processor disabled the plane\u2019s fuel gauges. There was no way for the crew to notice that they took off with only half the fuel they needed for the trip.  Interviews with the flight crew and ground crews discover that the error which led to the fuel shortage involved basic math. In 1983 most planes in Canada used imperial measurements to calculate the amount of fuel required for a flight but the new 767 was outfitted with metric gauges. The plane needed 22,300 kilograms of fuel for the trip but was only given half that: 22,300 pounds. \n\nWelcome to the OFFICIAL Mayday: Air Disaster YouTube Channel. \n\nMayday: Air Disaster is a dramatic non-fiction series that investigates high-profile air disasters to uncover how and why they happened. Mayday: Air Disaster follows survivors, family members of crash victims and transportation safety investigators as they piece together the evidence of the causes of major accidents. So climb into the cockpit for an experience you won\u2019t soon forget. \n\nSubscribe to the OFFICIAL Mayday: Air Disaster channel here: ",

                "description": "Professor Jim Al-Khalili traces the story of arguably the most important, accurate and yet perplexing scientific theory ever: quantum physics.\n\nThe story of quantum physics starts at the beginning of the 20th century with scientists trying to better understand how light bulbs work. This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.\n\nAlbert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s. Professor Al-Khalili repeats this critical experiment, posing the question does reality really exist, or do we conjure it into existence by the act of observation?\n\nElsewhere, we explore how the most famous law of quantum physics \u2013 The Uncertainty Principle \u2013 is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis. Could quantum mechanics explain the greatest mystery in biology - evolution?\n\nContent Provided By TVF International.

            "description": "This interview was not conducted to be a stand-alone interview, it was conducted for a Dutch documentary about male/female-dynamics in Canada. Within this documentary, we explored how an event like the Toronto van attack could happen in Canada and how Canadians are trying to heal from it. More broadly, we looked at misogyny and violence against women within Canada, and what it is about contemporary feminism that makes some men angry or lost. We also paid attention to men suffering from violence that their female partners had inflicted upon them. As prominent Canadian voices, we included both Margaret Atwood and Jordan Peterson.\n\nPsychology professor Jordan Peterson has become a controversial figure ever since speaking out against Bill C-16 (2016), a law which adds gender expression and gender identity to the Canadian Human Rights Act. He has received both praise and criticism after the publication of his self-help book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018). His fans are thankful for the advice he\u2019s given them to take responsibility for their lives, his critics argue that his emphasis on the danger posed by \u2018postmodern neo-marxists\u2019 is dangerous in itself. He has been accused of being anti-feminist and feeding into the alt-right. While he gained support among people who do identify with the alt-right, he himself does not. \n\nPeterson has become an important inspiration for various men\u2019s groups, an influential voice. Therefore, we wanted to get clear where he stands on contemporary feminism and how he interprets the van attack, which took place in the city he lives in. Since the documentary episode only allowed for brief passages from the interview, while Peterson\u2019s answers are extensive, we decided to provide the entire interview.\n\nWe talked to Peterson on the 4th of June 2019, in Toronto, Ontario. Since there were some breaks (for adjusting the camera and for having coffee) during the interview, it consists of multiple takes. Apart from leaving out the breaks themselves and making the transition between breaks more fluent, no further editing has been done. \n\nThe documentary about the Toronto van attack and male-female dynamics in Canada is available here: ",
