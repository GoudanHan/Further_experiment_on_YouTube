While both options are terrifying, Hasan has a plan. Hasan then takes things back to middle school with a discussion about snacks he never got to have growing up in an Indian household. He also chats with a Facebook employee about her experiences working with Mark Zuckerberg and what it was like to be in a book club with him. To close things out, Hasan tells the story of one of his scariest experiences. It\u2019s safe to say he doesn\u2019t mess around with haunted hotels anymore. \n\nWatch Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj on Netflix:",
