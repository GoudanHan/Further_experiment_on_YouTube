This can be a big problem on set, as any of these unwanted sounds can get in the way of dialogue. To ensure the sound team gets the best sound possible, the prop team will create silent versions of real products. Prop master Scott Reeder replaced loud pool balls with much quieter painted racquetballs for bar scenes in shows like \"Friday Night Lights.\" Meanwhile, Tim Schultz of Prop TRX uses vinyl and fabric to make quieter versions of grocery bags, sandwich bags, and cellophane, as seen on \"Entourage,\" \"Mike & Molly,\" and \"The Kominsky Method.\" Reeder and Schultz showed us how they found quiet alternatives to some of the loudest props out there.\n\nFind more of Tim Schultz\u2019s silent products here:",

Look at one of his favorite inventions \u2014 a bladeless turbine, or Tesla Turbine. The Tesla turbine had a simple, unique design, yet it was able to beat the efficiency levels of steam turbines at that time. Normal turbines are complex in design, with blades of complicated geometry and stator parts. Nikola Tesla once said the Tesla turbine is his favorite invention and he even claimed an efficiency level of 97% for this turbine. Let\u2019s start a design journey to understand this interesting piece of technology, and towards the end we will also verify Tesla\u2019s efficiency claim.\n\nBe our supporter or contributor: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",

Smollett faces six felony charges. He could spend three years in prison if he\u2019s convicted on all of them. Smollett\u2019s lawyers argue hilariously that he is the \u201creal victim,\u201d but no sober person on the planet believes that. Jussie Smollett faked a hate crime.
