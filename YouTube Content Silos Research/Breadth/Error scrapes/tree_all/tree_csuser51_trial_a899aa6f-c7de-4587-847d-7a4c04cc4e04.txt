Strength? Agility? In Dr. Joseph's TEDx Talk, he explores self confidence and how it is not just the most important skill in athletics, but in our lives.\n \nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

Senior Video Correspondent Graham Flanagan spent four days at the Army's Maneuver Center of Excellence located inside the Fort Benning military installation near Columbus, Georgia, where he observed different companies at various stages of training.\n\nAfter a processing period that takes one to two weeks, recruits experience what's known as a \"shark attack,\" when drill sergeants create a high-stress environment through a series of rapid-fire instructions and commands. Once the intensity subsides and training begins, the dynamic between the drill sergeants and the recruits evolves into one found between a teacher and students in a classroom.\n\nDespite rainy conditions that rarely let up during filming, we saw various dynamic aspects of training, such as marksmanship, tear gas exposure, and MOUT, which stands for military operations in urban terrain.\n\nIn the video, we incorrectly refer to duffle bags as rucksacks. Insider regrets the error.\n\nMORE BOOT CAMP CONTENT:\nWhat New Marine Corps Recruits Go Through In Boot Camp",

Paratroopers who successfully meet course requirements get to wear the coveted Silver Wings on their uniform, which they receive during graduation.

            "description": "Tobias Capwell is the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. Here, he reacts to 11 memorable scenes featuring medieval weapons and armor and rates them based on their historical accuracy. \n\nCapwell looks at armor and weapons within fantasy franchises, such as Sauron's armor in the battle of Orodruin in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001).  He addresses how helmets in \"The Mandalorian\" (2019) are influenced by Greek and Corinthian styles. Using artifacts from The Wallace Collection, Capwell addresses the realism of flails and maces as seen in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003). And he rates how realistic shields and swords are in \"Vikings\" (2014) and \"The Last Kingdom\" (2015). \n\nIs it possible to reforge swords, as seen in \"Game of Thrones\" (2011)? And how difficult would it be to fight in mud in full armor, like Robert Pattinson and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet do in \"The King\" (2019)? Does knightly combat look anything like \"Excalibur\" (1981), \"El Cid\" (1961), and \"Tale of Tales\" (2015)?\n\nTobias Capwell is an author, lecturer, broadcaster, and the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. He has been a horseman and martial artist since childhood, is a founding member of the modern historical jousting community, and has fought in major international tournaments all over the world. Capwell has written many books and articles on weapons, armor, tournaments, and knighthood, including \"Armour of the English Knight 1400-1450,\" \"Arms and Armour of the Medieval Joust,\" and \"Masterpieces of European Arms and Armour in the Wallace Collection.\" In 2015 he had the honor of serving as one of the two fully armored knights who escorted the remains of King Richard III from the battlefield at Bosworth to their final resting place in Leicester Cathedral.\n\nFind out more about The Wallace Collection here: ",

Senior video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent five days at the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot in Parris Island, South Carolina, where he observed different companies at various stages of training.\n\nRecruits endure a series of intense physical challenges such as entering a gas chamber, rappelling down a 47-foot-tower, and fighting each other with \u201cpugil sticks.\u201d The Marine Corps is the only US military branch that separates male and female recruits during basic training. In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson from the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot at Parris Island said, \u201cThe same gender platoon model allows for appropriate acclimation to the training environment, development of key relationships with drill instructors, and optimal focus during the beginning of their transformation.\u201d\n\nAfter weeks of extreme physical and psychological challenges, training culminates with \u201cThe Crucible,\u201d a 54-hour event where recruits endure exhausting combat scenarios while running on minimal food and sleep.\n\nMORE BOOT CAMP:\nWhat New Navy Plebes Go Through On Their First Day At Annapolis",
