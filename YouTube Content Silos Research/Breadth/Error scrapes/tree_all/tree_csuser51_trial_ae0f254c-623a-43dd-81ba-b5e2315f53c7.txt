He says that the illegal rave scene in the UK and lack of funding as a university student drove him to sell drugs on a larger scale. Pieter's operation eventually supplied many big time dealers in the UK. He then began importing cocaine from Ecuador to Europe through a cartel connection. Pieter was arrested in Ecuador and sentenced to 12 years in one of the worlds most violent and corrupt prisons. He now works as a public speaker on the dangers of drugs, and also presents a show on local radio station \u201cincapable staircase\u201d every Friday from 4-5:30 pm GMT.",

It's such a ubiquitous substance, everywhere around us, and inside of us, and since we need it to survive, it's fertile grounds for pseudoscience. What kinds of lies do people tell about water? There are many colorful examples we will cover, but this first part will focus on the main conspiracy surrounding water, and that is the fluoridation of tap water. From government mind control to neurotoxic effects, there is no shortage of misinformation associated with this incredible achievement of modern society, so let's run through the most common talking points and see what they're all about, shall we?\n\nFluoride mechanisms of action:\nFeatherstone review of 1990s work: ",

Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money.
