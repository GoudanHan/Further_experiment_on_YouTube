Italian spaghetti bolognese, Indian curry, Irish coddle, Chinese Kung Pao chicken, or Belgian chocolate? These all have one thing in common, other than the fact that they\u2019re delicious. They all rely on Native American plants.\n\nBefore Columbus stumbled upon the wrong continent, famines regularly ripped through Europe, Africa and Asia.\n\nAfter 1492, tables everywhere were introduced to corn, potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, chocolate, vanilla and many other foods.\n\nNow, over 60% of the food consumed worldwide originated in the Americas. But how did the Native Americans create and manage these incredible crops. What amazing effects did they have, and how did potatoes and bird poop create the modern world. Well, Let\u2019s Find Out.\n\nFollow me on twitter",
