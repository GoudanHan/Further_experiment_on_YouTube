I hope you enjoy it! \n\nSummary:\n\nThe tragic events surrounding Colonel Russell Williams stunned all Canadians and none more so than the members of the Canadian Forces.\n\nIn October of 2009, Russell Williams was a 46-year-old commander of the largest and highest functioning air force base in Canada. Williams was a model military man and highly respected by his peers. \n\nHe had been described as an elite pilot over the course of his 23-year career. He had flown Queen Elizabeth, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Governor General of Canada, the Prime Minister of Canada, and many other dignitaries in the Canadian Forces VIP aircraft.\n\nHe seemed to be the perfect example of a military leader, but something sinister and deadly was lurking deep within him. In October of 2010, he pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of sexual assault and confinement, and 82 other counts of break and enter, and theft. \n\nWhen that news came out, it made the headlines across Canada and around the world for months; a man that Canada had placed in a senior position of trust and authority turned out to have a dark secret life as a deviant killer. \n\nOn February 7, 2010, Williams was asked to be present at the Ottawa Police Service headquarters.\n\nEven 10 years after the interrogation took place at the Ottawa police headquarters, the Russell Williams interrogation video still packs a massive punch. It captures a vividly emotional and intellectual game of cat and mouse between a seasoned investigator and a powerful yet terrifying man who is slowly realizing that his game is up, and there is no room to maneuver.\n\nCredits:\n\nMusic:\nLemmino",

Charged with selling two illegal sawed-off shotguns to an undercover agent, Weaver had failed to appear in court and law enforcement was tasked with bringing him in. For months, the Weavers had been holed up on their property with a cache of firearms, including automatic weapons. When the federal agents surveilling the property crossed paths with members of the family, a firefight broke out. The standoff that mesmerized the nation would leave Weaver injured, his wife and son dead, and some convinced that the federal government was out of control. Drawing upon eyewitness accounts, including interviews with Weaver's daughter, Sara, and federal agents involved in the confrontation, Ruby Ridge is a riveting account of the event that helped give rise to the modern American militia movement.\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

            "description": "MESSAGE FROM RYAN HAYASHI TO THE VIEWERS: Ryan Hayashi, The Samurai Madman and European Champion of Magic, fools Penn & Teller with his award-winning Ultimate Matrix coin act. Damn, this sounds epic. Well actually, it was. I AM Ryan Hayashi, this is my YouTube channel, and I am writing about myself. This was one of the most epic and emotional moments of my life. It was a very special performance for me, showing magic to two of my heroes in magic. I was staring them in the eyes and performing for them the whole time, and I was nearly in tears walking off that stage. When they found me backstage after the show and gave me more kind words, I lost my mind. I'm normally a solid performer, but looking at this video, my precision, stage presence and comedic timing were off the chart! I hope you enjoy watching this performance as much as I do. This aired on July 9, 2018 on Season 5 of Fool Us. Ryan Hayashi",
