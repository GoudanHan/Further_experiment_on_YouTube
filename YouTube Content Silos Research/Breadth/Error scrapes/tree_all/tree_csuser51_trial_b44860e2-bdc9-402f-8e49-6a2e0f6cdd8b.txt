                    "description": "Skyrim is the ultimate RPG game designed by Video Game God Todd Howard and Exploit Creators Bethesda. In Their divine wisdom they gave the players of skyrim the most overpowered mage build in terms of damage outputs in skyrim. We took the strongest spell in skyrim and decided to see if we could also add it to our 100% resistant to magic build that we would need to do the absorb Magic Only challenge again! AND THEN add an additional 12,000% damage to that spell thanks to the fortify restoration loop exploit!   So how on earth can a player beat skyrim with only a 100% Resistance To Magic a skill which is exceedingly limited and has few overpowered gameplay features alongside the most overpowered mage build in the universe... You can take a level 1 character and turn them into the most powerful character in the entirety of the elder scrolls universe by having them become immune to magic and have magic powers that can evaporate a dragon in 1 second. So lets see if The Spiffing Brit can prove if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game or if spiff can exploit skyrim and beat the game with only Magic. \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this Skyrim Magic only challenge! How on earth can one english bugger beat Skyrim Special Edition with only resisting spells and using the most powerful lightening imaginable!! Its the most overpowered build yet!  Is it really a Magic Challenge... I mean there is not much of a challenge when you can 1 hit every single enemy...\n\nmajestic merch: ",

From picking between the Stormcloaks and Empire to deciding whether or not to spare Paarthurnax, The Elder Scrolls 5 is a game that affords the player a large amount of agency over its many narratives. Thankfully, many of the decisions we get to make in Skyrim are anything but easy, full of moral ambiguity rewards so tempting it\u2019s impossible to choose. These opportunities to exercise our own judgement are by far some of the most thought provoking and interesting moments in the entire world of Skyrim. So today, we\u2019ll be exploring some of the absolute best as we dive right into my top five toughest choices in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.",

Ancient, undead foes that guard the various Nordic ruins and tombs of The Elder Scrolls 5. While they're generally though to be one of Skyrim's more generic, less unique enemies, there's much about these skeletal beings that the game leaves out and is worth investigating. So today we'll be taking a look at five things you (probably) didn't know about the draugr of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.",

Brought to you by Raycon\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNOTE 1: I've attached a link below that covers some basic safety information about cyanide and how it was carefully handled when making this video.\n\nNOTE 2: I have revised my opinion about what it smells like. In the video, I said it was like an indoor pool and I correlated it to the chlorine. However, I think it's more accurate to say the pool locker room or shower. It is musty/moldy, with a background of pool smell. \n\nNOTE 3: After posting this video, I got a few messages from people saying that in their experience, cyanide DOES smell like almonds. So, I spent an hour tonight doing some tests, and I think the results are interesting. I did some direct comparisons and the smell of cyanide is distinctly different from the smell of almonds. However, if I EAT the almonds, there is sometimes a faint taste of cyanide. I think this is because sweet almonds still have a very small amount of amygdalin in them, which can release HCN. I don't think it's enough to smell in open air, but in your mouth it can be concentrated enough to be detected at the back of the nose. It's subtle, but it is definitely part of the flavor profile. So, while I still don't think it's accurate to say that it smells like almonds, for some people, it might be similar to the taste. To make that connection though, the person needs to a) be able to smell HCN and b) be particularly aware of that part of the flavor.\n\nI can smell the HCN, but I never noticed it in the flavor of almonds, so I didn't make the connection. I was even looking for a similarity and eating almonds at the same time, but never noticed it. It was only when I became very familiar with the smell of HCN that I started noticing it in almonds. What's interesting too, is that now after noticing it, I feel like I've started to associate the smell with almonds. It's no longer just a \"chemical\" smell and it feels more almondy. However, on the flip side, I feel like almonds taste worse and are more \"chemically.\"\n\nBut either way, I still don't think that saying it smells like almonds or bitter almonds is accurate or helpful. However, based on the messages I've received, some people are naturally associating cyanide with almonds (sometimes without knowing that this was even a thing and not even knowing they were smelling cyanide). This has piqued my interest and I think it could be fun to get to the bottom of this and to do a trial with a lot more people.\n\nSafety info about this video: ",

            "description": "In our latest Elder Scrolls video we discuss the many problems with the companions faction questline in Skyrim.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series and was released worldwide on November 11, 2011. The game's main story revolves around the player character and their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The videogame is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. \n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you probably joined the companions in your first playthrough as a warrior because it\u2019s the only warrior guild you can join. You kind of have to join it as a warrior class build if you\u2019re looking for a fighter\u2019s guild type experience; although, sadly in my later playthroughs of Skyrim, I\u2019ll often give it a miss for the reasons I\u2019ll be covering in this video. Instead I choose to focus on being a warrior-hero by doing dragonborn-related stuff. The main storyline, the dragonborn DLC, and even joining the Dawnguard and exterminating the vampires \u2013 it can all feel very warrior-like. But the Companions, as I\u2019ll explain, don\u2019t really seem to stand for much, nor have a compelling, well-devised main plot that makes it inspiring to be part of their faction. \n\nMERCH: ",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
