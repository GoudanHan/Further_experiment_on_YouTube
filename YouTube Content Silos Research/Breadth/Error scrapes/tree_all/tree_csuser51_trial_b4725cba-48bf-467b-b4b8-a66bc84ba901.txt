            "description": "Brief History of that other economic designed crash of 1929\nBBC documentary\n\nOn October 29, 1929, Black Tuesday hit Wall Street as investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors. In the aftermath of Black Tuesday, America and the rest of the industrialized world spiraled downward into the Great Depression (1929-39), the deepest and longest-lasting economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world up to that time.\n\n1929 Stock Market Crash\n\nDuring the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, after a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value. Among the other causes of the eventual market collapse were low wages, the proliferation of debt, a struggling agricultural sector and an excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated.\n\nStock prices began to decline in September and early October 1929, and on October 18 the fall began. Panic set in, and on October 24, Black Thursday, a record 12,894,650 shares were traded. Investment companies and leading bankers attempted to stabilize the market by buying up great blocks of stock, producing a moderate rally on Friday. On Monday, however, the storm broke anew, and the market went into free fall. Black Monday was followed by Black Tuesday (October 29), in which stock prices collapsed completely and 16,410,030 shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors, and stock tickers ran hours behind because the machinery could not handle the tremendous volume of trading.\n\n\n1929 Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression\n\nAfter October 29, 1929, stock prices had nowhere to go but up, so there was considerable recovery during succeeding weeks. Overall, however, prices continued to drop as the United States slumped into the Great Depression, and by 1932 stocks were worth only about 20 percent of their value in the summer of 1929. The stock market crash of 1929 was not the sole cause of the Great Depression, but it did act to accelerate the global economic collapse of which it was also a symptom. By 1933, nearly half of America\u2019s banks had failed, and unemployment was approaching 15 million people, or 30 percent of the workforce.",

Ancient Egypt was a powerful, influential, and expansionist empire that grew from the Nile River Valley to include much of the eastern Mediterranean. The civilization brought many inventions and advancements, including agriculture, art, architecture, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, religion, writing, and so much more.\n\nIn this four-part series, Professor of Egyptology Joann Fletcher examines Ancient Egypt's extraordinary rise and fall. She traces the mighty empire's humble nomadic beginnings to its zenith as prime architects and pyramid builders and, of course, its descent from worshipped pharaohs to tomb robbers and finally subjugated by the Romans.\n\nOdyssey is your journey into the world of Ancient History; from the dawn of Mesopotamia to the fall of Rome. We'll be bringing you only the best documentaries that journey into the mysteries and ruins of worlds long lost.\n\nIt's like Netflix for History: the world's finest documentary streaming service -- use the code 'Odyssey' to get 50% off your History Hit subscription! \n\ud83d\udc49 ",

It was supposed to only be 12 minutes long, but I got lost in the research and the scope and size of this topic, so I ended up making an almost one-hour long video. And still... I think this video doesn't contain enough information.\nThe Topic is India and Pakistan, their conflicts for independence and the historical background of such. As well as the conflicts that resulted out of independence. An overview of the Indian republic and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. As well as a brief intermission on Bangladesh and the geopolitics surrounding Sri Lanka. I hope you enjoyed the video. Don't forget to support the channel. And as said in the video, here is a bibliography:\n\nHermann Kulke - A History of India, 1998\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Landy - Dictionnaire de l'Inde contemporaine, 2010 (many thanks to the French subscriber who provided translations and information)\n\nLaurent Gayer - Karachi: Ordered Disorder and the Struggle for the City, 2014\n\nLaurent Gayer - Armed Militias of South Asia: Fundamentalists, Maoists and Separatists, 2008\n\n\n\u25baYou can support my channel on Patreon here: ",
