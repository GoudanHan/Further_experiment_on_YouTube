Every spring the pond reawakens with new life and beauty, and every year the UChicago community returns to visit the scenic corner of campus. \n\nThe historic Botany Pond was created as an outdoor research laboratory at the turn of the 20th century by John Merle Coulter, chair of the Department of Botany. In 2004\u2014with funding from the Julie and Parker Hall Botanic Garden Endowment Fund\u2014it underwent a major restoration, allowing it to remain a source of academic study, inspiration, and serenity for the UChicago community. \n\nBotany Pond remains a beloved campus space, enjoyed for its biodiversity that includes water lilies, ginko and akebia trees, turtles, fish, ducks\u2014and even the occasional heron.

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",
