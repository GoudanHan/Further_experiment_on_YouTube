Here, he reacts to 11 memorable scenes from DC movies and rates them based on their accuracy. \n\nKakalios addresses physical feats of DC superheroes, such as Joker in \"Suicide Squad\" jumping from an extreme height into a shallow vat of acid and Harley Quinn in \"Birds of Prey\" skating behind an automobile at high speed. He looks at the realism of superheroes' incredible skills, such as Aquaman's ability to sonically communicate with sharks and other fish. Would Shazam be able to charge up a mobile phone by shooting bolts of lightning at it? What material would Wonder Woman's bracelets need to be in order to deflect bullets?\n\nSuperman and Batman come under scrutiny in the video. Kakalios looks at Bruce Wayne's cape's rigidity in \"Batman Begins\" and whether it would allow Batman to fly across Gotham City. Would Superman be able to turn back time by flying around the world? Why can't he see through lead in \"Man of Steel\"? And finally, what are the odds that both Batman and Superman have mothers named Martha? Kakalios calculates the odds from \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\" \n\nKakalios is the author of three books, \"The Physics of Superheroes,\" \"The Physics of Everyday Things,\" and \"The Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics.\" He also worked as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. film \"Watchmen\" and won a regional Emmy for the video \"Science of Watchmen.\" A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.\n\nFor more, visit:",

The US mafia is featured in many classic movies from the 1920s onwards. We discuss the cultural significance and accuracy of famous crime scenes in movies and TV shows, such as \"The Godfather\" and \"The Sopranos.\" Franzese also points out inaccuracies in scenes from mob comedies such as \"Analyze This\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nFranzese discusses true stories and real-life characters featured in \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino.\" He talks about his proximity to the events of Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman,\" the Oscar-nominated movie starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. \n\nAfter Franzese was released from prison in 1995, he became the only high ranking official of a major mafia family to ever walk away, without protective custody, and survive. Franzese is the author of \"Blood Covenant\" and \"I\u2019ll Make You An Offer You Can\u2019t Refuse.\" He now works as a public speaker and motivator.\n\nMORE 'HOW REAL IS IT?':\n\nExplosives Expert Rates Movie Explosions: ",

Here, he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from jungle-warfare movies and rates them based on their accuracy. \n\nMason reviews classic Hollywood movies such as \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), \"Platoon\" (1986), \"Tears of the Sun\" (2003), \"Forrest Gump\" (1994), and \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002). He also rates the realism of the HBO miniseries \"The Pacific\" (2010).How reasonable are the jungle tactics in \"Predator\" (1987)? Does Christian Bale use the correct method for jungle helicopter rescue in \"Rescue Dawn\" (2006)? How realistic are the stealth and sniping tactics in \"Sniper\" (1993)? And would the camouflage Sylvester Stallone uses in \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" (1985) be successful? The Jungle Operations Training Course in Hawaii is a 12-day program for US Army regiments that covers mobility training, waterborne operations, combat tracking, jungle tactics, and survival training.

Here he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from Marvel movies and rates them based on their accuracy. Find out what exactly quantum mechanics, time dilation, Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, and spider silk tell us about the superheroes of the Marvel franchise.\n\nWhich weapon would you rather have in a fight: Thor\u2019s Mjolnir hammer or Captain America\u2019s shield? Hint: The answer has to do with the conservation of energy \u2014 and the sonoluminescence of vibranium. Dr. Kakalios breaks down the physics behind this and many other Marvel phenomena, including Shuri\u2019s holographic car in \u201cBlack Panther;\u201d  Peter Parker\u2019s spider-webbing train save in \u201cSpider-Man 2;\u201d the multiverse theory of \u201cDoctor Strange;\u201d the role of Pym particles and the Higgs boson in \u201cAnt-Man;\u201d artificial gravity in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy;\u201d and Tony Stark\u2019s cybernetic helmet and gold-titanium exoskeleton in \u201cIron Man.\u201d He sheds light on why Carol Danvers doesn\u2019t age from \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d to \u201cAvengers: Endgame;\u201d why the Space Stone is so powerful when yielded by Thanos in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War;\u201d and what\u2019s with all the talk of quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling, and \u201cquantum mumbo-jumbo\u201d in \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp.\u201d\n\nKakalios is the author of three books \u2014 \u201cThe Physics of Superheroes,\u201d \u201cThe Physics of Everyday Things,\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics.\u201d He was a science consultant for Sony\u2019s 2012 film \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man.\u201d Before that, he won an Emmy for his work as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. superhero film \u201cWatchmen.\u201d A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.\n\nFor more, visit:",
