As I am of course a huge fan of exploiting strategy games I took it upon myself to see if I could cheese the economy and the battle AI in 3 kingdoms total war. Today however I will be asking is total war three kingdoms a perfectly balanced game with no exploits. Or is it a game with exploits?? Who knows... well I do know that unlimited horses that have no maintenance as well as unlimited gold and armies might imbalance the game to a certain degree. Is that an exploit? Well alas this game break is going to be something special! \n\nWho even reads these anyways? I could probably just repeat The Spiffing Brit and Tea 40x and no one would notice ;) \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this total war Exploit! \n\n\nPatreon: ",
