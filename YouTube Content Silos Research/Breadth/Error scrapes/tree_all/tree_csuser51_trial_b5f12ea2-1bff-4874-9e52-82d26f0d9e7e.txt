            "description": "Former bank robber Cain Vincent Dyer looks at 11 bank-robbery scenes from popular TV shows and movies and rates them based on realism. \nDyer breaks down \"Heat\" (1995), \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" (2012), \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), \"Cherry\" (2021), \"Den of Thieves\" (2018), \"Dog Day Afternoon\" (1975), \"Baby Driver\" (2017), \"Out of Sight\" (1998), \"Money Heist\" (2017), \"The Town\" (2010), and \"Inside Man\" (2006).\n\nDyer served in the United States Marine Corps. He turned to bank robbery after threats to his family by a Mexican cartel. He was nicknamed the \"kangaroo bandit,\" having been captured on CCTV stuffing cash into a backpack worn on his chest. He says he robbed over 100 banks across California between 1999 and 2001. He eventually turned himself in and served nine years in prison after pleading guilty to six robberies. He now works as a life coach and motivational speaker, helping newly released prisoners reintegrate into society. He's also a partner in two production companies. \n\nAnyone who has been affected by violent crime can contact the National Center for Victims of Crime on 1 (202) 467-8700 or ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
