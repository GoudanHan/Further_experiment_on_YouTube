This is the full release of the series in its 2 hour entirety like I promised. If you have already watched the 8 separate pieces then you have already seen it all, this does not add anything new. This is the video as it was presented to my patreon supporters more than a month ago. \n\nIt took me an entire month to do this, from the planning phase to script writing, all the way to the editing. It was a very lengthy process but i am very satisfied with the result and i hope you are too!

                            "description": "In our latest Elder Scrolls video we discuss the many problems with the companions faction questline in Skyrim.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series and was released worldwide on November 11, 2011. The game's main story revolves around the player character and their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The videogame is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. \n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you probably joined the companions in your first playthrough as a warrior because it\u2019s the only warrior guild you can join. You kind of have to join it as a warrior class build if you\u2019re looking for a fighter\u2019s guild type experience; although, sadly in my later playthroughs of Skyrim, I\u2019ll often give it a miss for the reasons I\u2019ll be covering in this video. Instead I choose to focus on being a warrior-hero by doing dragonborn-related stuff. The main storyline, the dragonborn DLC, and even joining the Dawnguard and exterminating the vampires \u2013 it can all feel very warrior-like. But the Companions, as I\u2019ll explain, don\u2019t really seem to stand for much, nor have a compelling, well-devised main plot that makes it inspiring to be part of their faction. \n\nMERCH: ",
