He breaks down the martial arts prowess of stars such as Brad Pitt in \"Troy\" (2004), Orlando Bloom in \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005), and Russell Crowe in \"Gladiator\" (2000).\n\nHe also looks at some fantastical scenes such as the battle of Helm's Deep from \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" (2002) and the battle of Winterfell from \"Game of Thrones.\" Konijnendijk analyzes the historical accuracy of scenes from \"The Last Kingdom\" (2015) and \"Red Cliff\" (2008), and he rates the realism of the military formations, tactics, movements, and weaponry of each scene.\n\nFind out more about Konijnendijk here: ",
