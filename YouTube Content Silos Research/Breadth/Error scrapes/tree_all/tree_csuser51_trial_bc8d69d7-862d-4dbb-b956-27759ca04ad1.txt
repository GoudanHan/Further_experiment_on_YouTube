Does sarin gas release the way it's shown in \"The Rock\" (1996)? And would a bathtub protect you from an explosion such as in \"Lethal Weapon 2\" (1989)? \n\nDavies led specialist teams in Iraq and Afghanistan as one of the British Army's leading bomb-disposal and weapons-intelligence experts. As an advanced IEDD operator, he also trained deployable EOD teams and served as the principal bomb-disposal operator within the UK's premier counterterrorism unit. He was the military advisor to the Ministry of Defence's Special Projects Search and Countermeasures delivery team and remains an internationally recognized authority on CT bomb disposal and defense robotics.\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nPhysicist Rates 11 'Fast And Furious' Movie Stunts | How Real Is It?",

And for many Democrats, it\u2019s obvious that Republicans are thwarting progress toward a more equal society.\n\nBut what happens when Republicans aren\u2019t standing in the way?\n\nIn many states \u2014 including California, New York and Illinois \u2014 Democrats control all the levers of power. They run the government. They write the laws. And as we explore in the video above, they often aren\u2019t living up to their values.\n\nIn key respects, many blue states are actually doing worse than red states. It is in the blue states where affordable housing is often hardest to find, there are some of the most acute disparities in education funding and economic inequality is increasing most quickly.\n\nInstead of asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d Democrats need to spend more time pondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with California?\u201d\n\nSubscribe: ",

Rufo, a contributing editor for City Journal and a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute, for an extended conversation on why he\u2019s a prominent opponent of Critical Race Theory being taught in schools.   \n\nRufo says Critical Race Theory is \u201cstate-sanctioned racism.\u201d   \n\n\u201cTeaching history, teaching context, teaching competing viewpoints is good. But what is not good is taking an ideology like Critical Race Theory, turning it into official dogma and then compelling students to believe in ideas like race essentialism, racial superiority theory,\u201d Rufo says.   \n\nHill pushes back on Rufo\u2019s claim that is what CRT teaches.   \n\n\u201cCritical race theorists hold that the law and legal institutions in the United States are inherently racist insofar as they function to create and maintain social, economic, and political inequalities between whites and nonwhites, especially African Americans,\u201d per Brittanica. \n\nTo watch BNC programming, visit ",
