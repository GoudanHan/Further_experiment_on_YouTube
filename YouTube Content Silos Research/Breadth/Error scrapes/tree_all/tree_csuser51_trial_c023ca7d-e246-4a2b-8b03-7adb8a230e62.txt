            "description": "A channel named Modern Day Debate reached out to me based on my flat earth debunking to see if I would debate someone named Kent Hovind about Young Earth Creationism. Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

            "description": "We can find charlatans peddling snake oil in a wide variety of spheres, but there are quite a lot of lies that are told specifically about water. It's such a ubiquitous substance, everywhere around us, and inside of us, and since we need it to survive, it's fertile grounds for pseudoscience. What kinds of lies do people tell about water? There are many colorful examples we will cover, but this first part will focus on the main conspiracy surrounding water, and that is the fluoridation of tap water. From government mind control to neurotoxic effects, there is no shortage of misinformation associated with this incredible achievement of modern society, so let's run through the most common talking points and see what they're all about, shall we?\n\nFluoride mechanisms of action:\nFeatherstone review of 1990s work: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
