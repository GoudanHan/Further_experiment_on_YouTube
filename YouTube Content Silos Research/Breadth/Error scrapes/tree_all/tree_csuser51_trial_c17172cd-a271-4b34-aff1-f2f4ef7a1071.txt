            "description": "Germany has a much lower crime rate and fewer people in prison than the United States. How does Germany do that?  Is it because their prisons are different than ours?  Is there anything we could learn from them?  Find out.\n\nDistrict Attorney Rosen is an experienced prosecutor and a recognized leader in criminal justice reform.  His mission for the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office is to vigorously pursue justice in a way that is fair and treats everyone with respect.  His core values are service, hard work, transparency and integrity.\nSince arriving in the Bay Area, Mr. Rosen has been active in the community.  He served as president of a large synagogue, taught trial advocacy at Santa Clara University Law School and trained police officers in report-writing.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
