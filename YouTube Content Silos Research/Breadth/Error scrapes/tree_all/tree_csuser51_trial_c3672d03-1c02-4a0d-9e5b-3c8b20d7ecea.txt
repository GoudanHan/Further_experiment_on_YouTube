                "description": "In our latest Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim video we discuss what we believe is the MOST tragic city in all of Skyrim! Windhelm certainly looks cool, but after lots of thinking and consideration, we probably wouldn't want to spend much time there. In this video you will meet the faces of Windhelm, hear their stories, and perhaps get an insight into this Skyrim city that you may not have previously thought about. Just keep your wits about you, for Calixto could be lurking around any corner!\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series and was released worldwide on November 11, 2011. The game's main story revolves around the player character and their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The videogame is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. \n\nAt FudgeMuppet, we uncover the elder scrolls lore secrets that make this game so sensational, and in this video we're going to be diving into all of the events in Windhelm! We'll talk to the richest families and the poorest dock workers, piecing together their stories and building a picture of it all which proves that this city is sad no matter where you look. We do have many Skyrim mods on display which enhance the appearance of Skyrim's cities, and if you were to look at vanilla Skyrim, particularly the Gray Quarter, it is far less festive than shown in this video. If you think about it, this only strengthens the message of the video. It is also worth noting, which is talked about towards the end of the video, that even if you decide to take over the city with the Empire and wipe out the Stormcloaks, all you do is shift around the vibes and emotions in the city, as opposed to actually improving them.\n\nMERCH: ",
