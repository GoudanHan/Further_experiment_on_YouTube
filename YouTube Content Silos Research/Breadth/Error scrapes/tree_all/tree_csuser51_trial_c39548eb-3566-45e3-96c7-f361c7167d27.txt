The exhausted climbers were soon lost in a fierce blizzard and far from the safety of Camp 4 at 26,000 feeet. Renowned Climber/filmmaker David Breasheers, who was on the mountain that fateful day, returns to Everest to tell the complete story of what really happened on that legendary climb.\n\n\n------1996 Mt Everest Disaster-------\nThe 1996 Mount Everest disaster occurred on 10\u201311 May 1996, when eight climbers caught in a blizzard died on Mount Everest while attempting to descend from the summit. Over the entire season, 12 people died trying to reach the summit, making it the deadliest season on Mount Everest at the time and the third deadliest after the 16 fatalities of the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche and the 22 resulting from avalanches caused by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. The 1996 disaster received widespread publicity and raised questions about the commercialization of Everest.\n\nNumerous climbers were at a high altitude on Everest during the storm, including the Adventure Consultants team, led by Rob Hall, and the Mountain Madness team, led by Scott Fischer. While climbers died on both the North Face and South Col approaches, the events on the South Face were more widely reported. Four members of the Adventure Consultants expedition perished, including Hall, while Fischer was the sole casualty of the Mountain Madness expedition. Three officers of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police also died.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Frontline\ncir: 2008\nDirector: David Breashears",

                            "description": "According to the Hebrew Bible, the Ark of the Covenant is an ornate golden box, supposed to have housed the original ten commandments. As well as being a sacred artefact, there are several stories detailing its immense power, used by the Israelites in warfare to destroy enemy armies and flatten entire cities. However, at a certain point in the biblical account it vanishes. Never to be seen, or heard of, again.\n\nThe location of this mythical Hebrew item is one of history's most enduring mysteries. Although many believe that it was destroyed when a Babylonian army besieged Jerusalem in 587 BCE, there\u2019s evidence to suggest that it\u2019s still out there \u2013 waiting to be found. Some say that it's hidden in a desert cave, another group says that it's housed in a chapel in Ethiopia, others say that it's held in an underground vault deep below Jerusalem.\n\nIs the Ark of the Covenant REALLY lost? I want to investigate this matter carefully, and separate the fact from the fiction.\n\nI do hope you enjoy this video. I certainly had fun making it, and learnt a lot in the process (especially after some audio hiccups which are present in the video \u2013 sorry!). It is my largest video to date, and there's plenty more long-form content to come. Thank you all for nearly 400k subscribers.\nH.\n\n-------------\nNotes:\n\nWhoops! Looks like there is a quote that wasn't fully written out (\"...when these were fabricated ad hoc). It was there last time I checked!\n\n-------------\nChapters:",
