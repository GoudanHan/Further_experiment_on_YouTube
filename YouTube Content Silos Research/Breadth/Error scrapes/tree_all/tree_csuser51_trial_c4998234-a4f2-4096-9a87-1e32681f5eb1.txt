A worsening climate combined with political upheaval, famine and economic difficulties to plunge the state into a dark era of civil war, with the land dividing into smaller city-states headed by ambitious small-town leaders. In an obscure tomb in Thebes, she uncovers the stories of warriors who fought in the bloody battle that would eventually lead to Egypt's reunification, and reveals how settlers known as the `Hyksos' tried to infiltrate the fledgling nation's government to seize the throne.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.\n\nIn this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u2019s original holy city \u2013 as detailed in the Qur\u2019an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u2019s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u2018forbidden gathering place\u2019. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.\n\nIn the film \u2018The Sacred City\u2019 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u2013 while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.\n\nWhile clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u2019s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u2019an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.\n\nIn a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.\n\nBeautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...
