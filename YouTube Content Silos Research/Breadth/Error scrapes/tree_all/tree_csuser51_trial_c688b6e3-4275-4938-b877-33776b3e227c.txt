It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series and was released worldwide on November 11, 2011. The game's main story revolves around the player character and their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The videogame is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. \n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you probably joined the companions in your first playthrough as a warrior because it\u2019s the only warrior guild you can join. You kind of have to join it as a warrior class build if you\u2019re looking for a fighter\u2019s guild type experience; although, sadly in my later playthroughs of Skyrim, I\u2019ll often give it a miss for the reasons I\u2019ll be covering in this video. Instead I choose to focus on being a warrior-hero by doing dragonborn-related stuff. The main storyline, the dragonborn DLC, and even joining the Dawnguard and exterminating the vampires \u2013 it can all feel very warrior-like. But the Companions, as I\u2019ll explain, don\u2019t really seem to stand for much, nor have a compelling, well-devised main plot that makes it inspiring to be part of their faction. \n\nMERCH: ",

And for many Democrats, it\u2019s obvious that Republicans are thwarting progress toward a more equal society.\n\nBut what happens when Republicans aren\u2019t standing in the way?\n\nIn many states \u2014 including California, New York and Illinois \u2014 Democrats control all the levers of power. They run the government. They write the laws. And as we explore in the video above, they often aren\u2019t living up to their values.\n\nIn key respects, many blue states are actually doing worse than red states. It is in the blue states where affordable housing is often hardest to find, there are some of the most acute disparities in education funding and economic inequality is increasing most quickly.\n\nInstead of asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d Democrats need to spend more time pondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with California?\u201d\n\nSubscribe: ",
