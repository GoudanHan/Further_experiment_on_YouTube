What would have to be true for this scam to be pulled off? Rather incredibly, without making a single observation or knowing anything about science whatsoever, even just the story of the con itself falls apart quite laughably upon the slightest bit of scrutiny. Let's check it out.\n\nPart 1 in this series: ",

We just have to look at things in the sky with our eyeballs. In fact, that's how we figured out the earth is a sphere thousands of years ago, before science even existed. Last time we looked at the moon, so today let's look at the stars. How do they move through the sky, and can we make sense of it on a flat earth? Spoiler: no, we definitely can't. But be a lamb and watch anyway, would you?\n\nPart 1 in this series: ",

                "description": "Long before Homo sapiens populated the earth, the Neanderthals lived in Eurasia. \nNow, paleoanthropologists in England and France are using new archeological methods to shed light on some previously unexplained Neanderthal mysteries.\n\nIn an age clouded by the mists of time, the first early humans colonized the Eurasian continent. They settled on land that had only recently been covered by glaciers. This species, called Neanderthals, died out about 30,000 years ago -- but at one time, they formed the largest group in an area that stretched from northern France to the Belgian coast and from the Channel Islands to southern England. \n\nDuring the last Ice Age, the North Sea was frozen over -- and the English Channel was a small river that could easily be crossed on foot. The Neanderthals lived in close harmony with their perpetually changing environment. They had everything they needed to survive: the meat of prey animals, edible wild plants, water and wood for cooking and heating. How did these early humans develop over almost 300,000 years? What were their lives like before they became extinct? \n\nOur documentary is based on the latest research. We investigate various populations of Neanderthals, and visit archaeological sites in northern France, southern England, and on the island of Jersey. \n\nRenowned researchers such as the British paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer and his French colleague Ludovic Slimak describe how the Neanderthals lived, and discuss their cognitive abilities. Was this species capable of structured thinking? Did they have cultures, languages, and societies? How intelligent were they, and what sort of adaptive strategies kept them alive for 300,000 years? How similar were they to modern-day humans?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "description": "Anti-science mentality is rampant in this day and age, and one of the more peculiar aspects of this trend is the current fad that is the Flat Earth model. There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?\n\nWatch the whole Astronomy/Astrophysics playlist: ",

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
