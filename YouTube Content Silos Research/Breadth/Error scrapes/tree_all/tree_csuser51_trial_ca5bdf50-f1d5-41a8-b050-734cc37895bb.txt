                            "description": "The disaster at Chernobyl is still considered one of the worst nuclear accidents in history. It happened on April 26, 1986. Thirty-five years later, a group of survivors returns to the ghost city of Pripyat in northern Ukraine.\n\nA senior engineer who worked building the reactor, a maternity doctor from a local hospital, and an 11-year-old girl evacuated from Pripyat survived, as did a firefighter who served in Reactor Block 4 and an army officer who was in charge of removing radioactive debris from the reactor's roof. This documentary follows them as they return to their deserted homes for the first time. Their memories come together like pieces of a puzzle that depicts the fateful events of 1986. Firefighters and soldiers who became known as \"liquidators\" risked their lives to stabilize the site and prevent even greater radioactive contamination of Europe and the world. Only a few survived the mission. This emotional documentary directed by Roman Shumunov and written by Simon Shechter recounts a major historical drama in small, intimate stories, while using never before seen archive material that the people of Pripyat had hidden in their homes.",

How would nature react - and how swiftly?\n\nOn the edge of Europe, a deserted location reveals the surprising answer. An abandoned village can change in a very short time into a sanctuary for plants, birds and animals. Shy and rare species, some thought to be on the brink of extinction are found in robust good health.\n\nThis is Chernobyl, deserted by people after the worst nuclear disaster in history and now reclaimed by a remarkable collection of wildlife and the descendents of pets that were left in the city when the people went away. \nThis film unmasks the surprising faces of the new inhabitants. In houses where people once lived and laughed, unexpected wildlife is making itself at home. The adventures of a likeable cast of non-human characters give viewers a rare glimpse into an alternative world. Here wild animals face challenges in an environment totally outside their experience, while once-domestic species must rediscover their wild natures within. \n\nWhere is this place of abandonment and sanctuary? The location is well known and draws a cloud of uncertainty over the future for these animal characters.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: ",

The country has seen the largest lifting of people out of poverty that has ever taken place in human history, and today China is a global force, predicted to become the world\u2019s biggest economy in a couple of decades. \n\nSo how did an impoverished and backward communist country become an engine of global capitalism? What actually happened 40 years ago to set China on the road to prosperity?\n\nMichael Wood talks to the people who were there; the men and women who had been sent to be \u2018re-educated \u2018on farms and in factories; the farmers who defied the government and broke with communism; the woman has given the very first private business certificate; and the US technical advisor sent to China by the UN to kickstart the change. He travels across the country to meet China\u2019s highest-ranking female diplomat and the people who worked with Premier Deng Xiaoping. The film mixes these testimonies with a fascinating archive of the Chinese leader meeting President Carter in Washington and on fact-finding missions in Japan and Singapore.  Interviews too with Deng\u2019s biographer, Professor Ezra Vogel from Harvard University and Ambassador James Stapleton-Roy who lifts the lid on the intensive work behind the scenes which led to the US recognizing the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1979. \n\nThe second part of the film looks at the results of those initiatives in today\u2019s China,  visiting high-tech global giants Tencent and Alibaba and China\u2019s top universities Tsinghua and SUStech. We visit a high-speed rail workshop and the world\u2019s fastest-growing container port; we interview the American lawyer who set up the first Chinese deals for multinationals including Exon Mobile and Roche Pharmaceuticals.   Finally, we ask Robert Daly the Director of the Kissinger Institute on China and Ambassador Roy where they think China is heading, and if political reform will be on the agenda any time soon. \n\nChina\u2019s decision to open up to the world 40 years ago has been called \u2018the most important event of modern world history\u2019, and it is one in which America played a crucial role. Today China is a major player, flexing its muscles on the global stage. In this film, Michael Wood tracks the beginning of their meteoric rise, looks at the extraordinary scale of present-day developments and asks both Chinese and US experts for clues to the future.\n\nWith extraordinary access to key witnesses, this timely and important film tells the story of How China Got Rich.  \n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: ",

On huge screens, they can switch to any of the approximately one million cameras, to find out who\u2019s falling asleep behind the wheel, or littering, or not following Coronavirus regulations. \"We want people to feel good here, to feel that the city is very safe,\" says Sheng Dandan, who helped design the \"brain.\" Surveys suggest that most Chinese citizens are inclined to see benefits as opposed to risks: if algorithms can identify every citizen by their face, speech and even the way they walk, those breaking the law or behaving badly will have no chance. It\u2019s incredibly convenient: a smartphone can be used to accomplish just about any task, and playing by the rules leads to online discounts thanks to a social rating system. \n\nThat's what makes Big Data so attractive, and not just in China. But where does the required data come from? Who owns it, and who is allowed to use it? The choice facing the Western world is whether to engage with such technology at the expense of social values, or ignore it, allowing others around the world to set the rules.",

Within a decade, the share of urban dwellers is expected to increase to 75 percent. Construction is booming and competition for residential land is fierce.\n\nBut the right to live in a city in China is conditional. Authorities want their modern cities to be peopled with well-educated, highly-qualified or politically well-connected residents. As a result, certain standards have to be met to be eligible for a modern, urban home. Only members of China's political classes and the financially successful have a hope of qualifying. Yet more than half of the people who live in cities are so-called \"migrant workers.\" They come from rural communities and have no official rights to settle in cities. They are there to work. With no proper rights, they are merely tolerated while they serve as merchants, servants, waitstaff, cleaners, construction workers and tradespeople. But while they are indispensable to daily life in the cities, they are unable to afford their exorbitant rents. This documentary looks at how and where these workers live, and asks whether middle and working class Chinese even figure in the official vision of shiny, high-tech cities. The filmmakers also look at what happens to those who oppose official plans, or stand in the way of the building boom.",

How would nature react - and how swiftly?\n\nOn the edge of Europe, a deserted location reveals the surprising answer. An abandoned village can change in a very short time into a sanctuary for plants, birds and animals. Shy and rare species, some thought to be on the brink of extinction are found in robust good health.\n\nThis is Chernobyl, deserted by people after the worst nuclear disaster in history and now reclaimed by a remarkable collection of wildlife and the descendents of pets that were left in the city when the people went away. \nThis film unmasks the surprising faces of the new inhabitants. In houses where people once lived and laughed, unexpected wildlife is making itself at home. The adventures of a likeable cast of non-human characters give viewers a rare glimpse into an alternative world. Here wild animals face challenges in an environment totally outside their experience, while once-domestic species must rediscover their wild natures within. \n\nWhere is this place of abandonment and sanctuary? The location is well known and draws a cloud of uncertainty over the future for these animal characters.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: ",

Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.\n\nIn this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u2019s original holy city \u2013 as detailed in the Qur\u2019an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u2019s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u2018forbidden gathering place\u2019. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.\n\nIn the film \u2018The Sacred City\u2019 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u2013 while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.\n\nWhile clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u2019s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u2019an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.\n\nIn a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.\n\nBeautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

Filmmakers Gregor M\u00f6llers and Anne Lewald discretely shot the video on trips to North Korea in 2013 and 2017, when they were not allowed autonomy or spontaneity.\n\nDespite the fact that their itinerary was arranged for them in advance and guides chaperoned them everywhere, the two Berliners found a way to register their impressions. They depict a city lacking authenticity, a country longing for reunification and a people shaped by Juche beliefs and socialist propaganda. In a society steeped in obfuscation and spectacle, where deception is necessary for perception and expression, the filmmakers were forced to play a double role, secretly recording without permission while also genuinely relating to their hosts. By blending travelogue and espionage, A Postcard from Pyongyang captures what happens when you rely solely on what you see, not what you\u2019re told, and reveals a reality Kim Jong-Un\u2019s regime doesn\u2019t want foreigners to see.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Beginning in June 1941, this blitzkrieg attack on Russia and its leader Joseph Stalin would ultimately decide the Second World War.\n\nDespite early success against an unprepared Soviet army, the invasion began to slow down and eventually ground to a halt in December just 20km short of Moscow. At that moment the Russians struck back with a surprise winter counter-attack, bringing the offensive to an end.\n\nIn this episode of IWM Stories, John Delaney takes a look at why Operation Barbarossa failed with the help of archive film, photographs and battle maps.\n\nFind out more below:\n\nWhy did Barbarossa Fail?

            "description": "Japan attacked the U.S Pacific Fleet at its base at Pearl Harbor on the 7th of December 1941, but what led to that decision? Why did the Japanese attack the USA? - The answer is oil. \n\nJapan had been modernising its economy throughout the 20th century and wanted to build an empire of its own. However, Japan lacked the natural resources to make it a reality, with all but 6% of its oil supply being imported. After capturing Manchuria, Japan became bogged down in a full-scale war with China in 1937 and had to look elsewhere for the resources it needed to fight. Meanwhile, the USA was slowly awakening from its isolationism.\n\nWhen Japan occupied French Indochina in 1941, America retaliated by freezing all Japanese assets in the states, preventing Japan from purchasing oil. Having lost 94% of its oil supply and unwilling to submit to U.S demands, Japan planned to take the oil needed by force. However, striking south into British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies would almost certainly provoke an armed U.S response. To blunt that response, Japan decided to attack the U.S Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, hoping that the U.S would negotiate peace. \n\nThe attack at Pearl Harbor was a huge gamble, but one which did not pay off. Though Japan took its objectives in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, the U.S did not respond as expected. Instead of reverting to isolationism, the U.S geared up for total war and Japan's fate was sealed. \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: ",
