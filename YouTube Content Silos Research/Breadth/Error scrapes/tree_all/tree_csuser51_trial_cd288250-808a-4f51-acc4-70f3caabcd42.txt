As fascinating as it is when an archaeologist pulls something out of the ground and is immediately able to tell us all about what it is, and what it says about the people who came before us, we're much more excited when they come across something they can't explain. Even with all our current technology, the amount of information we're missing about our ancestors and the way they lived is startling. Perhaps we'd understand them a little better if we correctly understood the purpose of the strange artifacts you're about to see in this video!\n\nFor all questions contact us at: amazingstockchannel@gmail.com",

So many people incorrectly assume what Christians believe; that we are trying to live a good life so that hopefully our good outweighs our bad and God will let us go to Heaven rather than Hell. \n\nTim Mackie started up 'The Bible Project' which provides great animated teaching clips on Biblical concepts and also covers every book in the Bible. These have helped millions of people understand the Bible better.",

He's currently in the EDZ.  Make sure that you pick them up if you weren't playing then, as they are some of the best armor sets in the game. \n(More longer form videos coming, but people really seem to like these Destiny 2 PSA videos, so I guess I'll start doing more!)

The HyperCard-developed title ran into some snags when trying to run on the CD-ROM format. \"I had a really powerful Mac, with a lot of memory and a lot of hard drive space, and we were still working in mud,\" said Rand, discussing the game's performance early-on. Rand and his brother, Robyn, compressed the image and audio data as much as they could so the game could run smoothly on 1x CD-ROM drives.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",
