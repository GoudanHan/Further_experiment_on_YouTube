Along the way we encounter the horrors of the French occupation of Spain and Portugal, Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia, and the great struggle for German in 1813. The series concludes with arguably Napoleon's finest campaign - his doomed defence of Paris in 1814. \n\nSupport Epic History TV on Patreon from $1 per video, and get perks including ad-free early access & votes on future topics ",
