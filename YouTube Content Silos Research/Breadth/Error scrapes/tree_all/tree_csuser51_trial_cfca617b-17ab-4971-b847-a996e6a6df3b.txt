            "description": "A powerful explosion and fire at an Ottawa business, which produces tanker trucks, has killed one person, while five other people are missing and presumed dead. Mike Le Couteur reports on the investigation and hears from witnesses.\n  \nTo the pandemic, new federal modelling is projecting a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations over the next few weeks, adding to the strain on the health-care system. Abigail Bimman looks at the predictions for the days ahead.\n  \nAs the coronavirus continues to mutate, new evidence reveals how effective existing COVID-19 vaccines are against the Omicron variant. As Jamie Mauracher reports, the highly transmissible variant underscores the need for booster shots.\n \nMeanwhile, the legal battle of tennis champion Novak Djokovic is entering yet another set. Australia has once again cancelled his visa and as Eric Sorensen explains, it appears Djokovic now won't be able to compete at the Australian Open.\n  \nPlus, Global News has learned a Canadian man named Francois-Xavier Paradis-Garneau has been arrested by the Taliban. The 22-year-old from Quebec was travelling in Afghanistan. Jeff Semple explains why the Taliban detained Paradis-Garneau and has reaction from his family.\n  \nAnd who killed Const. Andre Lalonde in Montreal in 1996? Mike Armstrong looks at how the cold case continues to haunt the police officer's family.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",

Unvaccinated American truckers cannot enter Canada, while unvaccinated Canadian truckers must be tested for COVID-19 and quarantine for two weeks. As Abigail Bimman reports, the changes are likely to impact the supply chain and Canadians\u2019 grocery bills. \n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has said incentives and strong COVID-19 measures have worked to slow the virus\u2019 spread. But, there are lingering questions about whether Ottawa should support provinces, like Quebec, which has introduced a health tax on the unvaccinated. Mercedes Stephenson speaks with Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos about where the federal government stands on the issue.\n\nA monster storm is sweeping across the U.S. this weekend, dumping snow in several states and bringing the threat of a major ice event to several to parts of the south. The winter blast could put New England in a deep freeze and bring possible flooding to New York. Jennifer Johnson reports. \n\nFormer NDP Leader Alexa McDonough has died at the age of 77, following a lengthy battle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As Eric Sorensen reports, she is being remembered as a strong leader, a political pioneer and a stalwart supporter of women\u2019s rights in Canada. \n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of social media influencers, but what about \u201cfinfluencers?\u201d They talk money on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter, but it can be hard to know whom to trust. In part two of our Influenced series, Anne Gaviola takes a closer look at how to treat financial advice on social media.\n\nThe start of the Beijing 2022 Olympics is just over two weeks away and organizers are confident everything will be ready on time. Instead, there is concern about the spread of the highly-contagious Omicron variant. As Mike Drolet reports, China is going to extreme lengths to keep COVID-19 from spoiling the games.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",
