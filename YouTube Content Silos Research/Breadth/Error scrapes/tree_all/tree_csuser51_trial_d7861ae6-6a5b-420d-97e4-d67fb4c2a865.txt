        "description": "Quebec Premier Francois Legault is expected to provide an update Tuesday after accepting a resignation letter from public health director Dr. Horacio Arruda.\n\nIn the letter, Arruda said he gave the best of himself as he helped lead the province\u2019s response to the COVID-19 crisis, but that recent comments about the credibility of his and his team\u2019s advice have \u201ceroded the public\u2019s trust and adhesion.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to defend his work, however, saying the advice and recommendations he put forward were \u201cthe best possible\u201d amid \u201ca context of uncertainty and rapid progression of knowledge.\u201d\n\nArruda had been in the position as public health director for nearly 12 years but became one of the most visible faces of the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, which has seen more deaths than any other province \u2014 along with some of the harshest public health measures to help contain the virus.\n\nArruda\u2019s replacement has not yet been announced.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/8502342/qu...\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #COVID19 #Quebec",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
