He created a further 8 before his abdication in 1814. A few were aristocrats, but others were the sons of shopkeepers or tailors. The most favoured became princes and kings. Among their ranks were legendary figures such as Marshals Lannes, Ney, Soult, Davout and Mass\u00e9na, but also less well know figures like P\u00e9rignon, Brune and Moncey. Our series explores the lives of all 26 Marshals, and ranks them according to our own judgement of their achievements as Marshals. \n\nThank you to our series historical consultant Lt.Col.R\u00e9my Porte, whose blog on military history (in French) you can read here: ",

During the Second World War, the British commander of Singapore believed it to be an impregnable fortress until a numerically inferior Japanese Army overran it. Similarly, 12 years on, the French lost the mountain garrison at Dien Bien Phu after failing to anticipate the resourcefulness of General Giap and his Vietmanese peasant army.\n\nWe have long saluted military genius and bravery. But the other side of the coin is military incompetence \u2013 a largely preventable, tragically expensive, yet totally absorbing aspect of human behaviour.\n\nFrom the Crusades to Vietnam, history is littered with examples of stupidity, obduracy, brutality and sheer breath-taking incompetence. Lack of communication, technological failure and a misplaced sense of superiority have led to the deaths of thousands of ordinary soldiers, let down by their masters and betrayed by arrogance. Using a combination of history, human interest and archive footage underpinned by powerful story-telling, Great Military Blunders charts man\u2019s folly and cruelty in a series of stunning debacles, spanning almost a thousand years of conflict.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...
