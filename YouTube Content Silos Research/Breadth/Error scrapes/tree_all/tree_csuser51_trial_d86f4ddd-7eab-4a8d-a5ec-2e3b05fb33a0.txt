The HyperCard-developed title ran into some snags when trying to run on the CD-ROM format. \"I had a really powerful Mac, with a lot of memory and a lot of hard drive space, and we were still working in mud,\" said Rand, discussing the game's performance early-on. Rand and his brother, Robyn, compressed the image and audio data as much as they could so the game could run smoothly on 1x CD-ROM drives.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",

By using case histories of innocent persons who were wrongfully imprisoned because of information they gave to police, Duane debunks the claim that \u201cif you haven\u2019t done anything wrong, then you don\u2019t have anything to worry about.\n\nView the full event here: ",
