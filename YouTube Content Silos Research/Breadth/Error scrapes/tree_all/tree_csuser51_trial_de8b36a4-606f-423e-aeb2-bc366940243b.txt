The soldiers took the cub under their wing, and before long, the cub grew into a giant brown bear that became the mascot for the 22nd Artillery Supply Company. Wojtek would become a friend of the soldiers and help scare away enemies. Watch today's amazing video to meet Wojtek, the WW2 brown bear!\n\nCheck out my new channel I Am: ",

However, the easternmost state the Ancient Greeks created was the kingdom of Bactria, which gained independence from the Seleucid Empire. This state became the shining beacon of the civilization in the region and influenced it for centuries to come, most famously by creating a synthesis with one of the Buddhist sects - the Mahayana.\n\nCheck out this playlist to learn more about Ancient warfare: ",
