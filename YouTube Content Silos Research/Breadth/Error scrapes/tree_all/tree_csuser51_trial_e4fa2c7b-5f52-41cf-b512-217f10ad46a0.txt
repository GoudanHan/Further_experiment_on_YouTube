This video was recorded at The Australian National University on 10 April 2012.\n\nRichard Dawkins FRS is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford. Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.\n\nHe is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.\n\nRichard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He has been awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the Nakayama Prize, the Cosmos International Prize, the Kistler Prize, the Shakespeare Prize and the Lewis Thomas Prize.\n\nLawrence M. Krauss is a renowned cosmologist and science populariser, and is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is also the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and nine books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and his most recent bestseller entitled A Universe from Nothing.\n\nHe received his PhD from MIT in 1982 and then joined the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and was a professor at Yale University and Chair of the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University before taking his present position. Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist and Scientific American and appears regularly on radio and television. He is one of the few scientists to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, and is also active in issues of science and society. He serves as co-chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and on the Board of Directors of the Federation of American Scientists.",

He and I exchanged some words regarding racism, politics, and psychology, and hilarity ensued. As a disclaimer, there is no educational merit to this exchange whatsoever. This is 90 minutes of Jesse saying the dumbest things imaginable, and me mocking him relentlessly in response. Only watch this if that sounds entertaining to you.\n\nNote: I turned off comments because I got tired of spending 1-2 hours a day explaining basic logic to ignorant bigots. If you were planning to drop a comment on another video, or message me on some other platform, please first read the following:\n1) Out of wedlock does not mean single. You don't have be married to raise children together, and in fact, black couples disproportionately don't marry. Out of wedlock does not equal single parent. Read that sentence as  many times as you need to in order to get it into your skull. Jesse misrepresented the statistic, and then piled other claims on top regarding crime and drug use with no basis. He was wrong. Let me repeat. He was wrong.\n2) Jesse's ancestors were indeed slaves. He was lying. He is a liar. Google it.\n3) The history of slavery is irrelevant, so stop acting like you're a history scholar. It doesn't matter if there were times that slavery wasn't racist. When one race enslaves another race, it's racist.\n4) If you were planning on saying nothing but spewing Jesse's catch phrases, congratulations, you are among the dumbest people alive.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates/discussions: ",

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man.

So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",
