Henry Chaisson, Nick Antosca and Cooper. In ANTLERS, small-town Oregon elementary school teacher Julia Meadows (Keri Russell) notices something is \"off\" about Lucas, one of her students. He's a quiet loner, and when asked to join in storytelling and drawing assignments, he presents disturbing material about mythical beasts inspired by local lore. Concerned, Julia seeks to learn more about Lucas's home life. When it appears that he is living in dire conditions, Julia and her brother Paul (Jesse Plemons), the town's sheriff, explore further, eventually discovering that Lucas is harboring a dangerous secret. When they ultimately learn the whole truth about Lucas's family, things take a terrifying turn. Genre master del Toro is joined by producers David S. Goyer and J. Miles Dale, with Jim Rowe, Nick Antosca and Kevin Turen as executive producers. Graham Greene, Scott Haze, Rory Cochrane and Amy Madigan also star in this chilling story that ties an ancient terror to insatiable human greed and its modern wages of poverty, addiction and environmental devastation.",

At the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings. In an effort to thwart Grindelwald\u2019s plans, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.",

But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world. Born of a god but raised as a man, Perseus (Sam Worthington) is helpless to save his family from Hades (Ralph Fiennes), vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, Perseus volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus (Liam Neeson) and unleash hell on earth. Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds, leading a daring band of warriors, including Draco (Mads Mikkelsen), an experienced soldier who encourages the defiant Perseus to make use of his god-given abilities. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, they will only survive if Perseus can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.
