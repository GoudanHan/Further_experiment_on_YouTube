                        "description": "Tens of thousands are missing, many more murdered. So why are Mexico\u2019s violent drug cartels operating with impunity? We go inside the most powerful cartel to meet the footsoldiers. Corruption, they say, goes right to the top. Produced in collaboration with Ben Zand and Vice TV.\n\nIn Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa state, violence has become a way of life.\nHome to the country\u2019s most powerful drug syndicate, the Sinaloa cartel, murders and disappearances are rife.\n\nThe police, meant to protect the population, are often the targets of violence. Over 500 officers were killed in Mexico last year.\n\nThey\u2019re also often complicit, with corruption in the police force and government a major problem.In this shocking portrait of a country caught in the grip of organised crime, reporter Ben Zand takes us where few have gone \u2013 inside the Sinaloa cartel in the Sierra Madre mountains where he witnesses the group\u2019s operations up close.\n\nAt their hidden base, the group grows poppies and marijuana for export, fends off outsiders with guns and bribes visiting police and security officers with money and women.\n\n\u201cThe government is the one in charge\u201d say the local leader. \u201cThe cartel is only as big as the government wants us to be.\u201d\n\nCommentator and writer Ioan Grillo believes that the police and military used to have the upper hand with the cartels but says that\u2019s now changed.\n\n\u201cSome of the cartels have become much more powerful,\u201d says Grillo. \u201c[now] the cartel is actually bullying and controlling elements of the security forces.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the community who\u2019s paying the price for corruption and impunity. \nMirna Qui\u00f1ones\u2019 son disappeared suddenly 7 years ago. When police refused to help her, she set out to find him herself. \n\nShe went on to set up the Trackers of El Fuerte group which helps parents looking for their children. In the last seven years of searching, they\u2019ve uncovered over two hundred bodies.\n\n\u201cThere is no justice. We all know that. I have been threatened by the municipal police here. The government and crime are united.\u201d\n\nInterior Minister, Olga S\u00e1nchez Cordero, concedes there is corruption. \u201cThe trials, and the investigations, are deficient\u201d, she says. \u201cLawyers are threatened. Judges are threatened. That is just the reality.\u201d\n\nBut she maintains the government is doing its best to investigate the cartels and to undermine their support base. \n\nInvestigative journalist Anabel Hern\u00e1ndez disagrees, saying she has little faith the government of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, elected two and half years ago, will tackle the problem.\n\n\u201cHe promised to do something different but\u2026.it\u2019s just the same. Nothing changed. In some parts it's worse.\"\n\nAbout Foreign Correspondent: \nForeign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

I hope you enjoy it! \n\nSummary:\n\nThe tragic events surrounding Colonel Russell Williams stunned all Canadians and none more so than the members of the Canadian Forces.\n\nIn October of 2009, Russell Williams was a 46-year-old commander of the largest and highest functioning air force base in Canada. Williams was a model military man and highly respected by his peers. \n\nHe had been described as an elite pilot over the course of his 23-year career. He had flown Queen Elizabeth, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Governor General of Canada, the Prime Minister of Canada, and many other dignitaries in the Canadian Forces VIP aircraft.\n\nHe seemed to be the perfect example of a military leader, but something sinister and deadly was lurking deep within him. In October of 2010, he pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of sexual assault and confinement, and 82 other counts of break and enter, and theft. \n\nWhen that news came out, it made the headlines across Canada and around the world for months; a man that Canada had placed in a senior position of trust and authority turned out to have a dark secret life as a deviant killer. \n\nOn February 7, 2010, Williams was asked to be present at the Ottawa Police Service headquarters.\n\nEven 10 years after the interrogation took place at the Ottawa police headquarters, the Russell Williams interrogation video still packs a massive punch. It captures a vividly emotional and intellectual game of cat and mouse between a seasoned investigator and a powerful yet terrifying man who is slowly realizing that his game is up, and there is no room to maneuver.\n\nCredits:\n\nMusic:\nLemmino",

This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal. The last three were all awarded by the now-extinct government of the Republic of Vietnam.  He received the PUC and the two Vietnamese unit citations as a member of 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment.
