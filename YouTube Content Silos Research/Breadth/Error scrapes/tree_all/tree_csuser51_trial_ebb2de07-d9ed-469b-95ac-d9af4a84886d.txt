            "description": "It\u2019s a case involving one of the worst examples of fraud in the history of German industry. Who knew about the manipulation of VW\u2019s diesel emissions, and just as importantly - when?\n\nIn September 2015 US authorities revealed that VW had been selling diesel cars fitted with software designed to improve emission results when engines were being tested. VW went on to admit that millions of vehicles were affected worldwide. In the US the company has been obliged to pay billions in fines, and two former employees were handed down lengthy jail sentences.\n\nIn Germany the wheels of justice have been slower to turn. But now former CEO Martin Winterkorn and four other former managers face criminal charges, and 90 further former employees are under investigation. What role did Winterkorn play in the affair? How much did he know? And, above all, how could so many professional engineers working for a global leader suddenly find themselves facing allegations of breaking the law?\n\nThe documentary reveals how one of Germany\u2019s major industrial concerns wove a web of lies and obfuscation over the course of almost a decade. How engineers claim to have re-sisted attempts to introduce manipulation only to later submit to systematic fraud, how managers even today claim to have known of absolutely nothing about irregularities. \n\nIt is an object lesson in the need for civil courage in the world of big business. The story is also a painful one about that special breed of hierarchies where ultimately no one feels the need to accept responsibility. The affair also shines a light on the world of complicity between politics and business, a world often quick to turn a blind eye. The film outlines the most important events in the years leading up to the scandal. Internal documents and interviews with those involved reveal an exclusive picture of what allegedly took place.",

        "description": "The booming global tire market is worth billions - but this comes at a high price, both to humans and the environment. Over 50 million car tires are sold each year in Germany alone. But where does the natural rubber for them come from?\n\nThe biggest producer of natural rubber for tires is Thailand. More than four million tonnes of rubber are harvested annually in plantations there. And demand for rubber is ever growing - because ever more tires are needed. But the labor conditions in Southeast Asia are harsh - with working days of up to 12 hours and very low wages. In addition, toxic herbicides banned in Europe are used to fight weeds on the plantations. After the harvest, the \u2018white gold\u2019 rubber is sold to brokers, who, in turn, sell it on. German tire manufacturers, like Continental, for example, are keen to stress that they use \"natural commodities conscientiously.\u201d But many car drivers don\u2019t give a second thought about where the rubber in their tires comes from - and why we don\u2019t recycle used tires more effectively. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
