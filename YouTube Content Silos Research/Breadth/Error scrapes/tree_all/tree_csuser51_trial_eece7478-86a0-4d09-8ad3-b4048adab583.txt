He is the originator and popularizer of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology and science in general, including funny enough the introduction of the word meme in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which in the context of a gene-centered view of evolution is an exceptionally powerful idea. He is outspoken, bold, and often fearless in his defense of science and reason, and in this way, is one of the most influential thinkers of our time.\n\nPS: There is some occasional noise in the audio, which I tried to clean up in the edit.\n\nSupport this podcast by signing up with these sponsors:\n- Cash App - use code \"LexPodcast\" and download:\n- Cash App (App Store): ",

With economic returns often uncertain, space programmes have tended to be led by governments, because only they can invest in programmes that have a long-term pay-off, whether economic or geopolitical.

Find out what exactly quantum mechanics, time dilation, Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, and spider silk tell us about the superheroes of the Marvel franchise.\n\nWhich weapon would you rather have in a fight: Thor\u2019s Mjolnir hammer or Captain America\u2019s shield? Hint: The answer has to do with the conservation of energy \u2014 and the sonoluminescence of vibranium. Dr. Kakalios breaks down the physics behind this and many other Marvel phenomena, including Shuri\u2019s holographic car in \u201cBlack Panther;\u201d  Peter Parker\u2019s spider-webbing train save in \u201cSpider-Man 2;\u201d the multiverse theory of \u201cDoctor Strange;\u201d the role of Pym particles and the Higgs boson in \u201cAnt-Man;\u201d artificial gravity in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy;\u201d and Tony Stark\u2019s cybernetic helmet and gold-titanium exoskeleton in \u201cIron Man.\u201d He sheds light on why Carol Danvers doesn\u2019t age from \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d to \u201cAvengers: Endgame;\u201d why the Space Stone is so powerful when yielded by Thanos in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War;\u201d and what\u2019s with all the talk of quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling, and \u201cquantum mumbo-jumbo\u201d in \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp.\u201d\n\nKakalios is the author of three books \u2014 \u201cThe Physics of Superheroes,\u201d \u201cThe Physics of Everyday Things,\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics.\u201d He was a science consultant for Sony\u2019s 2012 film \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man.\u201d Before that, he won an Emmy for his work as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. superhero film \u201cWatchmen.\u201d A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.\n\nFor more, visit:",

            "description": "Tobias Capwell is the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. Here, he reacts to 11 memorable scenes featuring medieval weapons and armor and rates them based on their historical accuracy. \n\nCapwell looks at armor and weapons within fantasy franchises, such as Sauron's armor in the battle of Orodruin in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001).  He addresses how helmets in \"The Mandalorian\" (2019) are influenced by Greek and Corinthian styles. Using artifacts from The Wallace Collection, Capwell addresses the realism of flails and maces as seen in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003). And he rates how realistic shields and swords are in \"Vikings\" (2014) and \"The Last Kingdom\" (2015). \n\nIs it possible to reforge swords, as seen in \"Game of Thrones\" (2011)? And how difficult would it be to fight in mud in full armor, like Robert Pattinson and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet do in \"The King\" (2019)? Does knightly combat look anything like \"Excalibur\" (1981), \"El Cid\" (1961), and \"Tale of Tales\" (2015)?\n\nTobias Capwell is an author, lecturer, broadcaster, and the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. He has been a horseman and martial artist since childhood, is a founding member of the modern historical jousting community, and has fought in major international tournaments all over the world. Capwell has written many books and articles on weapons, armor, tournaments, and knighthood, including \"Armour of the English Knight 1400-1450,\" \"Arms and Armour of the Medieval Joust,\" and \"Masterpieces of European Arms and Armour in the Wallace Collection.\" In 2015 he had the honor of serving as one of the two fully armored knights who escorted the remains of King Richard III from the battlefield at Bosworth to their final resting place in Leicester Cathedral.\n\nFind out more about The Wallace Collection here: ",

Does sarin gas release the way it's shown in \"The Rock\" (1996)? And would a bathtub protect you from an explosion such as in \"Lethal Weapon 2\" (1989)? \n\nDavies led specialist teams in Iraq and Afghanistan as one of the British Army's leading bomb-disposal and weapons-intelligence experts. As an advanced IEDD operator, he also trained deployable EOD teams and served as the principal bomb-disposal operator within the UK's premier counterterrorism unit. He was the military advisor to the Ministry of Defence's Special Projects Search and Countermeasures delivery team and remains an internationally recognized authority on CT bomb disposal and defense robotics.\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nPhysicist Rates 11 'Fast And Furious' Movie Stunts | How Real Is It?",
