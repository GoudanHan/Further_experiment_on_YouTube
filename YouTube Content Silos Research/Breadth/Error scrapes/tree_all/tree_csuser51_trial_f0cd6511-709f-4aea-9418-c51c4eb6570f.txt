This is truly a video for you if you want to learn how to make the perfect steak! I hope you enjoy friends, and start making those Steaks! You will learn 5 very important  things to do.\n#1 Don\u2019t waste your time taking the steak out 20 minutes before cooking it.  It accomplishes NOTHING.\n#2 Do not wait the last minute to salt your steak.  Add salt AT LEAST 45 minutes before cooking it! (one or two days is even better!)\n#3 Get yourself a good instant read thermometer, pushing your thumb in the palm of your hand DOES NOT WORK!\n#4 Searing the steak DOES NOT seal in the juices. (its only purpose is to create a delicious crust)\n#5 Be sure to let it rest at least 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven. Before cutting into it.\n\nRecipe Link: ",
