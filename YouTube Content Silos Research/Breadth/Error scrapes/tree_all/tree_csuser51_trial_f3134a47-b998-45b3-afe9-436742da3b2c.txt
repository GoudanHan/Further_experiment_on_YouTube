Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

But then again, you voted for this video.\nAs I described it when I put it up to be voted on, I believe Trump's single biggest failure as a president is his handling of China and the way his ineffective and lack-luster foreign policy allowed for a communist dictatorship to rise and build a superpower within a block of unfree states that can even rival the United States and has by now even found ways to influence the politics of democratic nations.\n\nI would like to underline one thing though. I despise the \"orange man bad!\" \"Dump Drumpf\" political culture developing in the United States, in which even Trump's opposition just constantly meanders about pointless and meaningless things rather than actually criticize the president's stupid policies. With that in mind, videos I will be making about the election as 2020 approaches will be more focused on looking at and critiquing actual policies and not about pedantic nonsense. Because I genuinely believe that Trump has been a terrible president, but the reason why the U.S public complains about him has nothing to do with why he is terrible.\n\nI hope you enjoy this video. It's long because I believe for people to understand the gravity of the situation one needs to have a basic understanding of Chinese history going back a few thousand years, from the many Dynasties of the Han, Qing and Yuan, to the century of Humiliation, to the brutal civil war between communists and the Kuomintang, to the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, to where we are now, which is China is a world power that actively challenges America's role in the world. The Belt and Road initiative that builds a new silk road, the Chinese Dream policy, and doctrine, the String of Pearls strategy, it's influence of Australian and European politics, and the way it created and opened markets in African nations such as Kenya are all discussed here in a historical context, that I hope will give you much insight. I hope you will enjoy it.\n\nIf you want to vote on the topic of the next video, you have to become a patron.
