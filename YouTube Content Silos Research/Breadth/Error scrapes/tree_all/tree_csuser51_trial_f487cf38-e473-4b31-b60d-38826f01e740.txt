His new book is The Dying Citizen: How Progressive Elites, Tribalism, and Globalization Are Destroying the Idea of America. As is typical whenever Dr. Hanson joins us, this interview covers a wide spectrum of topics and references, including the Acts of the Apostles, immigration, Jim Crow laws, primary tribal identities, the suburban everyman, the shrinking middle class, and JFK\u2019s \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d speech.  It\u2019s a bracing conversation with a scholar who has an incredible breadth of interests and knowledge.\n\nFor further information: ",

He\u2019s also been speaking and writing about climate science for almost 20 years. In this wide-ranging discussion with Peter Robinson, Lomborg analyzes the Biden administration\u2019s plan to address climate change, lauds a slew of new clean energy technologies that are coming in the next decade, and discusses the upsides\u2014and the downsides\u2014of migrating the world from a carbon-based economy to one based on electricity generated by clean energy sources. \n\nFor further information: ",
