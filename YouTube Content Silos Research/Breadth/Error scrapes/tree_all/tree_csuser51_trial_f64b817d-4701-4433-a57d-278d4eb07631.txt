        "description": "Marc Lamont Hill sits down with Christopher F. Rufo, a contributing editor for City Journal and a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute, for an extended conversation on why he\u2019s a prominent opponent of Critical Race Theory being taught in schools.   \n\nRufo says Critical Race Theory is \u201cstate-sanctioned racism.\u201d   \n\n\u201cTeaching history, teaching context, teaching competing viewpoints is good. But what is not good is taking an ideology like Critical Race Theory, turning it into official dogma and then compelling students to believe in ideas like race essentialism, racial superiority theory,\u201d Rufo says.   \n\nHill pushes back on Rufo\u2019s claim that is what CRT teaches.   \n\n\u201cCritical race theorists hold that the law and legal institutions in the United States are inherently racist insofar as they function to create and maintain social, economic, and political inequalities between whites and nonwhites, especially African Americans,\u201d per Brittanica. \n\nTo watch BNC programming, visit ",
