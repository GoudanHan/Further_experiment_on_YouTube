He created a further 8 before his abdication in 1814. A few were aristocrats, but others were the sons of shopkeepers or tailors. The most favoured became princes and kings. Among their ranks were legendary figures such as Marshals Lannes, Ney, Soult, Davout and Mass\u00e9na, but also less well know figures like P\u00e9rignon, Brune and Moncey. Our series explores the lives of all 26 Marshals, and ranks them according to our own judgement of their achievements as Marshals. \n\nThank you to our series historical consultant Lt.Col.R\u00e9my Porte, whose blog on military history (in French) you can read here: ",

Along the way we encounter the horrors of the French occupation of Spain and Portugal, Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia, and the great struggle for German in 1813.

                        "description": "Brief History of that other economic designed crash of 1929\nBBC documentary\n\nOn October 29, 1929, Black Tuesday hit Wall Street as investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors. In the aftermath of Black Tuesday, America and the rest of the industrialized world spiraled downward into the Great Depression (1929-39), the deepest and longest-lasting economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world up to that time.\n\n1929 Stock Market Crash\n\nDuring the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, after a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value. Among the other causes of the eventual market collapse were low wages, the proliferation of debt, a struggling agricultural sector and an excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated.\n\nStock prices began to decline in September and early October 1929, and on October 18 the fall began. Panic set in, and on October 24, Black Thursday, a record 12,894,650 shares were traded. Investment companies and leading bankers attempted to stabilize the market by buying up great blocks of stock, producing a moderate rally on Friday. On Monday, however, the storm broke anew, and the market went into free fall. Black Monday was followed by Black Tuesday (October 29), in which stock prices collapsed completely and 16,410,030 shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors, and stock tickers ran hours behind because the machinery could not handle the tremendous volume of trading.\n\n\n1929 Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression\n\nAfter October 29, 1929, stock prices had nowhere to go but up, so there was considerable recovery during succeeding weeks. Overall, however, prices continued to drop as the United States slumped into the Great Depression, and by 1932 stocks were worth only about 20 percent of their value in the summer of 1929. The stock market crash of 1929 was not the sole cause of the Great Depression, but it did act to accelerate the global economic collapse of which it was also a symptom. By 1933, nearly half of America\u2019s banks had failed, and unemployment was approaching 15 million people, or 30 percent of the workforce.",

Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.\n\nIn this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u2019s original holy city \u2013 as detailed in the Qur\u2019an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u2019s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u2018forbidden gathering place\u2019. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.\n\nIn the film \u2018The Sacred City\u2019 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u2013 while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.\n\nWhile clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u2019s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u2019an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.\n\nIn a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.\n\nBeautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

            "description": "A look at the tragic consequences of underestimating the enemy. During the Second World War, the British commander of Singapore believed it to be an impregnable fortress until a numerically inferior Japanese Army overran it. Similarly, 12 years on, the French lost the mountain garrison at Dien Bien Phu after failing to anticipate the resourcefulness of General Giap and his Vietmanese peasant army.\n\nWe have long saluted military genius and bravery. But the other side of the coin is military incompetence \u2013 a largely preventable, tragically expensive, yet totally absorbing aspect of human behaviour.\n\nFrom the Crusades to Vietnam, history is littered with examples of stupidity, obduracy, brutality and sheer breath-taking incompetence. Lack of communication, technological failure and a misplaced sense of superiority have led to the deaths of thousands of ordinary soldiers, let down by their masters and betrayed by arrogance. Using a combination of history, human interest and archive footage underpinned by powerful story-telling, Great Military Blunders charts man\u2019s folly and cruelty in a series of stunning debacles, spanning almost a thousand years of conflict.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
