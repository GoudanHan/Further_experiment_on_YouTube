You have to challenge\u201d\n\nRecently a team of fossil hunters working in Kenya came upon a set of fossilised teeth and a series of bones. Their find set in motion a chain of events that ignited excitement across the scientific world, for if they were correct in their findings, not only would they have found the oldest human ancestor, but much of the received wisdom humankind\u2019s evolution would have to be rewritten. This programme is the story of their discovery and the implications it has for understanding of how we split from the apes. Dubbed \u201cMillennium Man\u201d by the press, he is twice as old as the most famous skeleton in the world \u201cLucy\u201d. The remarkable link between Millennium Man and humans is his ability to walk on two legs, overturning previously accepted scientific opinion on why, how and when humans began to walk. As Professor Senut who worked on the project points out, \u201cScience doesn\u2019t proceed or get better with established ideas. You have to challenge\u201d and Millennium Man seems to be challenging an awful lot of accepted science. Documentary first broadcast in 2001.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

A worsening climate combined with political upheaval, famine and economic difficulties to plunge the state into a dark era of civil war, with the land dividing into smaller city-states headed by ambitious small-town leaders. In an obscure tomb in Thebes, she uncovers the stories of warriors who fought in the bloody battle that would eventually lead to Egypt's reunification, and reveals how settlers known as the `Hyksos' tried to infiltrate the fledgling nation's government to seize the throne.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

Ancient Egypt was a powerful, influential, and expansionist empire that grew from the Nile River Valley to include much of the eastern Mediterranean. The civilization brought many inventions and advancements, including agriculture, art, architecture, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, religion, writing, and so much more.\n\nIn this four-part series, Professor of Egyptology Joann Fletcher examines Ancient Egypt's extraordinary rise and fall. She traces the mighty empire's humble nomadic beginnings to its zenith as prime architects and pyramid builders and, of course, its descent from worshipped pharaohs to tomb robbers and finally subjugated by the Romans.\n\nOdyssey is your journey into the world of Ancient History; from the dawn of Mesopotamia to the fall of Rome. We'll be bringing you only the best documentaries that journey into the mysteries and ruins of worlds long lost.\n\nIt's like Netflix for History: the world's finest documentary streaming service -- use the code 'Odyssey' to get 50% off your History Hit subscription! \n\ud83d\udc49 ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am.

Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
