Lush subtropical flora and venerable live oaks draped with wild muscadine and swags of barbe espagnole, or Spanish moss, cover this geological oddity, which is one of five \"islands\" rising above south Louisiana\u2019s flat coastal marshes.\n\nThe island occupies roughly 2,200 acres and sits atop a deposit of solid rock salt thought to be deeper than Mount Everest is high. Geologists believe this deposit is the remnant of a buried ancient seabed, pushed to the surface by the sheer weight of surrounding alluvial sediments.\n\nToday, Avery Island remains the home of the TABASCO\u00ae brand pepper sauce factory, as well as Jungle Gardens and its Bird City wildfowl refuge. The Tabasco factory and the gardens are open to the public.\n\nIn the 1890s, just before taking over as president of Tabasco from his father, E.A. \"Mr. Ned\" McIlhenny started this refuge in an effort to save the snowy egrets. From just eight of the birds, that had been hunted for their plumes to near extinction, the colony has thrived and now thousands of birds migrate here every spring.",

        "description": "Professor Antony Davies explains the many miss-understandings about Government Debt. Myth 1 is that the government owes \u201conly\u201d $20 trillion. (In reality, it\u2019s much more.) But luckily, Myth 10 is that there\u2019s no way to fix this problem\u2026 \n\nMyth number one, the government owes $20 trillion. How much is $20 trillion? Suppose you go to Germany, and in Germany, you go to every town. In every town, you visit every store. In every store, you look at every shelf and grab everything that is for sale. The amount of money you spend will not be $20 trillion. If you go to Germany and then to France and you go to every town, and within every town, you go to every store. In every store, you look on every shelf and you buy everything. You still will not have spent $20 trillion. You can go to England and while you\u2019re there, you can go to the North Countries and buy everything that\u2019s for sale, and you still will not have spent $20 trillion. In fact, to spend $20 trillion, you have to go to every country in Europe, visit every town, in every town, go to every store. In every store, look on every shelf and buy everything. And then you will have spent about $20 trillion.\n\nBut the myth is that this is how much money the government owes. It turns out that there\u2019s more, called unfunded obligations. Unfunded obligations is money the Federal Government has promised but which it does not and will not have the money to pay. Largely, this consists of promises of retirement and medical benefits. If you would take the present value of all the future promises of retirement and medical benefits the government has made and subtract from that the amount of money that\u2019s in the government\u2019s Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and then subtract from that the amount of money the Federal Government anticipates collecting under the current law from future Social Security and Medicare taxes, you will still have an amount of money left over that the government does not have.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
