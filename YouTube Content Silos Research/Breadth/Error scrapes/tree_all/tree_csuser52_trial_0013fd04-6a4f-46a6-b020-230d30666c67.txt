From government mind control to neurotoxic effects, there is no shortage of misinformation associated with this incredible achievement of modern society, so let's run through the most common talking points and see what they're all about, shall we?\n\nFluoride mechanisms of action:\nFeatherstone review of 1990s work: ",

It pissed off a lot of people, such as a fellow named Ben Davidson, who I had never heard of, but that has a YouTube channel called \"Suspicious0bservers\" which talks about things sort of tangentially related to this topic. Without any provocation, he took it upon himself to slander me and threaten me by email, before making a ridiculous excuse for a response video countering my debunk. This is my response to his response, because I don't really appreciate being called a fraud, particularly when his response is full of abject nonsense as is his channel in general. Enjoy.\n\nUPDATE: Since this video, I've taken it upon myself to dig a lot deeper and I found out precisely what a con man Ben is. Beyond his fraudulent cash grabs on Kickstarter, he is currently busy building a donor-funded apocalypse camp (literally), which makes him a cult leader. More information on his scams can be found in a more recent video which I highly recommend watching and sharing, since there is no telling what horrors will occur on that camp if it gets built: ",

Isn't life way too complex for that to happen? It seems ridiculous, right? Well, no. Not if you understand biochemistry, which creationists do not. But every once in a while, a hero emerges from academia to champion the cause of the creationist, and lend some illusory credence to their views. In this case, that hero is James Tour, a synthetic organic chemist who insists that abiogenesis is impossible, and he should know better than anyone, because he's a chemist. I was made aware of Dr. Tour after a couple hundred people linked me to a video of his in an empty argument from authority, insisting that because a chemist confirms their religious bias, they must be right. But is Dr. Tour a bit biased himself? Let's find out precisely what his agenda is, shall we?\n\nUpdate: James Tour responded to this single video with a dumpster fire of a 14-part series overflowing with stupidity and lies, which qualifies for the Dunning-Kruger Hall of Fame. Naturally I tore through it like tissue paper, so to watch me do that please check out my two-part response which exposes his fraudulence ten times more thoroughly than this video:\nPart 1: ",

This is the notion that the positions of the stars and planets in the sky at the moment of your birth have an influence on your characteristics, and that their positions over time influence daily events. Can this be possible? By what mechanism does this influence propagate? If it's true, why haven't we encountered anything like this in our study of astronomy? Shouldn't we be able to do experiments to test its validity? We sure can. Let's take a real good look at what astrology proposes, and see if we can to the bottom of whether there is any truth to it or not.\n\nLarge-scale study showing no correlation between date of birth and personality: ",

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
