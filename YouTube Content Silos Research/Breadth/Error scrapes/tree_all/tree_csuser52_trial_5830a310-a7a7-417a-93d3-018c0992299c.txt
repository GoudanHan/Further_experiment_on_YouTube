He breaks down long-range-sniping scenes featuring Will Smith in \"Gemini Man\" (2019) and Mark Wahlberg in \"Shooter\" (2007). \nHe also looks at modern-day war movies set in Iraq and Afghanistan, such as \"American Sniper\" (2014), \"Jarhead\" (2005), \"Lone Survivor\" (2013), and \"The Hurt Locker\" (2009).

That's why movies and TV shows have found many ways to make crowds look bigger than they are. Older movies like \"Ben-Hur\" used matte paintings, while movies like \"Glory Road'' have used inflatable extras. Today, duplication and CGI are the most frequently used techniques. On the Apple TV  series \"Ted Lasso,\" Barnstorm VFX had the daunting challenge of filling a 26,000-seat stadium using a mix of real and fake people. As Barnstorm VFX supervisor Lawson Deming told us, it's the mix of the two that best convinces the viewer.\n\nThanks to Barnstorm VFX for speaking with us and providing footage from \"Ted Lasso\" and \"Insecure.\" Check out more of its work here:\nwww.barnstormvfx.com",

            "description": "Before they become snipers, all students must graduate from the US Army Sniper Course, a seven-week program that teaches soldiers from the Army and National Guard essential skills in fieldcraft and marksmanship. Insider spent two days at the US Army Sniper Course inside the Fort Benning military installation near Columbus, Georgia, where we observed various classes at different stages of training.\n\nJust 288 students are accepted into the Sniper Course each year, and roughly half pass the course and graduate. Students learn to operate several weapons systems and must master hitting targets up to 1,100 meters away. Prospective snipers learn how to create ghillie suits, a type of camouflage clothing that snipers use to blend in with their environment. They are educated in a wide array of fieldcraft skills, including target detection, range estimation, and stalks, where they must stealthily move through wooded terrain without being spotted by instructors. Those who are able to graduate from the course could be deployed into combat as snipers immediately if necessary.\n\nMORE BOOT CAMP VIDEOS:\nThe Toughest Obstacles Marines Face In The \u201cConfidence Course\u201d | Boot Camp",

        "description": "Some objects, like paper bags, ice cubes, and pool balls, make an unexpected amount of noise. This can be a big problem on set, as any of these unwanted sounds can get in the way of dialogue. To ensure the sound team gets the best sound possible, the prop team will create silent versions of real products. Prop master Scott Reeder replaced loud pool balls with much quieter painted racquetballs for bar scenes in shows like \"Friday Night Lights.\" Meanwhile, Tim Schultz of Prop TRX uses vinyl and fabric to make quieter versions of grocery bags, sandwich bags, and cellophane, as seen on \"Entourage,\" \"Mike & Molly,\" and \"The Kominsky Method.\" Reeder and Schultz showed us how they found quiet alternatives to some of the loudest props out there.\n\nFind more of Tim Schultz\u2019s silent products here:",
