A leading expert on animal behavior, she has even been the subject of a movie, in which Claire Danes played her in an award-winning performance. Her accomplishments are legion, including her creation of livestock-handling facilities based on animals' natural behavior. But her greatest impact might be as one of the most prominent adults with autism. The condition has given Grandin unique insights, orienting her work on animals and allowing her to rethink human nature. The result is a series of best-selling books\u2014\"Animals Make Us Human,\" \"Animals in Translation,\" and \"Thinking in Pictures,\" among many others\u2014as well as the hug (or \"squeeze\") machine, used for calming hypersensitive patients. More recently, autism itself has become the subject of her research. Her most recent book, \"The Autistic Brain,\" presents the latest physiological research and charts the shift from neurological to genetic approaches to the condition. Grandin shares this new work with her trademark intelligence and accessibility.\n\nThis program is generously underwritten by Rose L. Shure.",

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

There exists an obscure fad called the electric universe, which tends to attract exemplars of the Dunning-Kruger effect who think they understand physics better than Einstein. Literally. Although not quite as ridiculous as the flat earth, it's still pretty ridiculous, so let's go through the finer points of precisely why that is the case, shall we?\n\nWatch my other debunks: ",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
