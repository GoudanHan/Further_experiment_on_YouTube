She is the recipient of four United States Attorney Awards for Distinguished Service. She now hosts the true-crime podcast \"FBI Retired Case File Review\" and works as a technical consultant for TV shows and movies depicting the FBI. \n\nWilliams is the author of \"FBI Myths and Misconceptions: A Manual for Armchair Detectives\": ",

                        "description": "Former US submarine commander L. David Marquet rated the realism of submarine scenes in popular movies, judging their technological accuracy as well as the depiction of life on board.\n\nMarquet addresses the realism of nuclear crisis movies, such as \"The World Is Not Enough\" and \"K-19: The Widowmaker,\". He also rated the accuracy of standoff scenes in \"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"The Enemy Below\", \"Hunter Killer,\" and \"Crimson Tide.\" He also breaks down the realism of costumes, tactics, and terminology from \"U-571.\"\n\nIs life on board a submarine, including confined conditions and drills, as depicted in \"Das Boot\"? Would Navy SEALs enter a submarine from a HALO drop similar to \"Act of Valor\", and is it possible for a submarine to hear music from the water's surface, like in  \"The Wolf's Call\"? Can holes on a submarine be plugged with pins and other metal objects, as we see in \"The Simpsons\"? Would nuclear missiles be triggered by dislodging in a ship interior, such as in \"Aquaman\"?\n\nMarquet graduated top of his class from the US Naval Academy and served for 28 years on submarines, including as an engineer officer aboard the USS Will Rogers, then as captain on the USS Olympia and the USS Santa Fe. Having retired in 2009, he is now a Wall Street Journal best-selling author of \"Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders.\"\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

He addresses scenes featuring pop stars at concerts and award shows, such as \"Taken\" (2008) and \"The Bodyguard\" (1992). He also discusses transporting and taking care of political clients, as seen in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" (2017) and \"The West Wing\" season three episodes 20 and 21 (2002), and billionaires like Tony Stark in \"Iron Man 3\" (2013). \n\nHow should bodyguards react when their principal tries to shake them off, as in \"Arrow\" (2020)? How much information about threats should the principal be aware of, like in \"Close\" (2019)? How should you deal with an inebriated celebrity client, as Malcom does in \"Empire\" (2015-)? \n\nBodyguards go through intense training to be ready to protect actors, singers, CEOs, and politicians. Security firm Global Threat Solutions has protected the likes of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and hosts trainings for new bodyguards trying to break into the field. \n\nFind out more about Global Threat Solutions here: ",

Does sarin gas release the way it's shown in \"The Rock\" (1996)? And would a bathtub protect you from an explosion such as in \"Lethal Weapon 2\" (1989)? \n\nDavies led specialist teams in Iraq and Afghanistan as one of the British Army's leading bomb-disposal and weapons-intelligence experts. As an advanced IEDD operator, he also trained deployable EOD teams and served as the principal bomb-disposal operator within the UK's premier counterterrorism unit.
