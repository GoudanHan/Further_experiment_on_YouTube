                        "description": "Documentary directed by Margot Schotel Omroep Zeeland (2019) about the battle of the Scheldt. An large and important battle in the autumn of 1944, wich was crucial for the liberation of the Netherlands and Europe\n\nAfter D-Day (6 June 1944), the Allied Forces quickly conquered the north of France and Belgium. Already on 4 September they took Antwerp, a strategically vital harbor. However, the river Scheldt, the harbor\u2019s supply route, was still in German hands. Montgomery was ordered by Eisenhower to secure both sides of the Scheldt, the larger part of which is located in the Netherlands, but Montogomery decided otherwise and started Operation Market Garden. He left the conquest of the Scheldt to the Canadians and the Polish Armies who then had to fight a much stronger enemy that was ordered by Hitler himself to keep its position at all costs. Even though Market Garden eventually failed, it received an almost mythological status in the narrative about the World War II, while the successful battle for the Scheldt was never really acknowledged by history.  \n\nWith the cooperation of Tobias van Gent, Ingrid Baraitre, Carla Rus, Johan van Doorn ea.\n\n\nBlijf op de hoogte van het laatste Zeeuwse nieuws:  ",

Between 1937 and 1947 over 20,000 of them were built and in those 10 years, Spitfires changed dramatically from the Mk 1 to the Mk 24. More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world. In this episode of Duxford in Depth, Graham Rodgers looks at how the Spitfire evolved by taking us through just a few of Duxford's collection of Spitfires including marks 1, 5, 9, 14, and 24.\n\nFrom 27 December until 20 February, see a world-first at IWM Duxford \u2013 the largest collection of Spitfires ever assembled under one roof!

We were sipping cocktails in the art-deco building with string theorist and science superstar Robbert Dijkgraaf as he told us all about the fundamental laws of Nature. Afterwards, cellist and composer Benjamin Glorieux performed a musical piece together with invited guests especially commissioned for the occasion, while live-video artist Klaas Verpoest accompanied them with his visual magic.\n\nWhat is string theory? What happens to stuff that falls inside a black hole? What are the fundamental building blocks of space and time? Did Nature have any choice in picking the fundamental laws of physics? What is the role of mathematics in physics?\n\nThis talk by professor Robbert Dijkgraaf was recorded on 13 July 2019 at Flagey in Brussels.

            "description": "The Supermarine Spitfire is one of the most iconic aircraft of all time. Between 1937 and 1947 over 20,000 of them were built and in those 10 years, Spitfires changed dramatically from the Mk 1 to the Mk 24. More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world. In this episode of Duxford in Depth, Graham Rodgers looks at how the Spitfire evolved by taking us through just a few of Duxford's collection of Spitfires including marks 1, 5, 9, 14, and 24.\n\nFrom 27 December until 20 February, see a world-first at IWM Duxford \u2013 the largest collection of Spitfires ever assembled under one roof! Get up close to twelve Spitfires of varying marks side by side on display for a limited time only: ",

And for many Democrats, it\u2019s obvious that Republicans are thwarting progress toward a more equal society.\n\nBut what happens when Republicans aren\u2019t standing in the way?\n\nIn many states \u2014 including California, New York and Illinois \u2014 Democrats control all the levers of power. They run the government. They write the laws. And as we explore in the video above, they often aren\u2019t living up to their values.\n\nIn key respects, many blue states are actually doing worse than red states. It is in the blue states where affordable housing is often hardest to find, there are some of the most acute disparities in education funding and economic inequality is increasing most quickly.\n\nInstead of asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d Democrats need to spend more time pondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with California?\u201d\n\nSubscribe: ",

Our Oscar-shortlisted documentary \u201cDay of Rage\u201d charts in chilling detail how the peaceful transition of power was disrupted by rioters who stormed a seemingly impenetrable seat of government.\n\nThe team behind \u201cDay of Rage\u201d will release scenes and other reporting that were left on the cutting room floor on the film\u2019s Twitter account, @dayofrage.\n\nSign up for our Visual Investigations newsletter: ",
