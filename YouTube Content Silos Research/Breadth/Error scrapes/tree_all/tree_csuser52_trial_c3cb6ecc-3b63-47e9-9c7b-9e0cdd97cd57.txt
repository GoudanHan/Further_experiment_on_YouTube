            "description": "The massive scope of the MCU has allowed Marvel Studios to create a sprawling, interconnected universe built on a shared continuity, and much like the comics the movies are based on, that means things can get pretty complicated.\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't start with Tony Stark getting kidnapped in 2008, Carol Danvers being taken to Hala in the '90s, or even with Steve Rogers volunteering for the Super Soldier program in the '40s. Instead, like most universes, this one starts at the Big Bang. \n \nGoing chronologically, the first event we see in the MCU is the creation of the Infinity Stones. As the Collector explains in Guardians of the Galaxy, they were formed from the \"six singularities\" that caused the universe to explode into existence, before being scattered across the universe. \n\nThat, of course, was billions of years ago, but \"millions of years\" before we get to the present-day MCU, Ego the Living Planet comes into existence and starts seeding worlds with his essence in an attempt to create another Celestial being like himself.\n\nWatch the video to see the entire MCU timeline explained!",

This time, Heath Ledger joins the cast as The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart stars as Harvey Dent in an all-new adventure of The Dark Knight. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and new district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart--Thank You for Smoking), Batman sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham City forever. The three enjoy early success, but they soon find themselves prey to a rising criminal mastermind known as The Joker (Ledger--Brokeback Mountain), who throws Gotham into anarchy and forces Batman ever closer to crossing the line between hero and vigilante.",
