When I watch these, I always laugh out loud myself & I think it's hilarious. This video includes both new stuff & old stuff. Here is the thing, I've made sure not to waste a second of your time, everything which is not laughter is giving context to the coming laughter. Just be patient it will pay off. \n\nI dedicate this to my subscribers, because, look at 95% of the comment sections of my compilations. They're the best of youtube. Enjoy!",

This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal. The last three were all awarded by the now-extinct government of the Republic of Vietnam.  He received the PUC and the two Vietnamese unit citations as a member of 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment.

Click the following link and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson! http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow\n.............................................................\n\nThis is the all-new Mercedes-AMG SL! \n\nNow the all-new SL has something very special compared to its predecessor - it\u2019s now exclusively available as an AMG! \n\nWith that in mind, you can imagine performance is pretty good. And trust us, it is! The range-topper is the SL 63, which comes packing a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet that can put down an astonishing 585hp & 800Nm of torque! What\u2019s more, it\u2019ll propel you to 60mph in just 3.6 seconds! \n\nBut wait, it gets better! Once you step inside, you\u2019ll notice a whole load of similarities to the S-Class, with a huge infotainment screen dominating the dashboard. You\u2019ll also find high-quality materials throughout the cabin, while upfront there\u2019s a pair of comfortable sports seats. \n\nHowever, as you can imagine, all that quality and performance doesn\u2019t come cheap, with the AMG SL having a starting price of \u00a3125,000!! So is it worth it? You\u2019ll have to stick with Mat to find out!\n\nChapters",
