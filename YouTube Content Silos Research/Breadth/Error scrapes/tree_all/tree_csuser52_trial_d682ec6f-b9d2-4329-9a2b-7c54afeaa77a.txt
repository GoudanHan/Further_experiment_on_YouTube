Although the 16-bit generation started in the late summer of 1989 with the near-simultaneous launch of the Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16, the release of the Super Nintendo in August of 1991 signaled the real start of the 16-bit console war.  The system came bundled with Super Mario World as the pack-in game, and on launch day two additional games were available; F-Zero and Pilotwings.  Many believe that Gradius III and SimCity were also launch titles, but these games were actually released the following week, just missing being part of the launch line-up.   \n\nSpecial thanks for the following people for their support making this episode:\n\nChris Covell (",
