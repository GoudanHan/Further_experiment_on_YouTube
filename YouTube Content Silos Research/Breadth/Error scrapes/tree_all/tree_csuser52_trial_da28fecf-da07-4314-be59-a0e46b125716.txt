For three nail-biting seconds it looked as if the mission would have to be aborted. However, Armstrong was given a \"go\" to continue, and after several more alarms the Eagle touched down safely on the Moon.\n\nRobert Wills introduces the amazing hardware and software that made up the Apollo Guidance Computer, walks you through the landing procedure step-by-step, and talks about the pioneering design principles that were used to make the landing software robust against any failure. He also explains the problems that occurred during the Apollo 11 landing, and shows you how the Apollo Guidance Computer played its part in saving the mission.\n\nChapters:",

                            "description": "A virtual talk by Sir Dermot Turing.\n\nSurely Enigma was broken by the British at Bletchley Park? The real story begins much earlier, in December, 1932.  In the bathroom of a Belgian hotel, a French spymaster photographs secret documents \u2013 operating instructions of a new cipher machine, Enigma. A few weeks later a mathematician in Warsaw begins to decipher the coded communications of the Third Reich and lay the foundations for the famous operation at Bletchley Park. In this illustrated talk Dermot Turing explains the international alliance which set the Bletchley Park codebreakers on the path to the British Bombe, as seen at The National Museum of Computing.\n\nDermot Turing is the acclaimed author of Prof: Alan Turing Decoded, a biography of his famous uncle, The Story of Computing, and most recently the award-winning X, Y and Z \u2013 the real story of how Enigma was broken. His new book, a reappraisal of Alan Turing\u2019s legacy, Reflections of Alan Turing, is published on 22 April He began writing in 2014 after a career in law. Dermot worked for the Government Legal Service and then the international law firm Clifford Chance, where he was a partner until 2014. He is a Visiting Fellow at Kellogg College, Oxford.\n\nThis Illustrated talk last approximately 40 minutes, followed by a 20 minute Q&A session.\n\nRecorded 7th April 2021.",
