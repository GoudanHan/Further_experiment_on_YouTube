                            "description": "It was the worst storm to ever hit northwest Ohio. Between January 26 and January 29, 1978, 12 inches of snow fell on the sleepy towns of northwest Ohio. But it wasn't the accumulation that was a problem. Winds gusted at 60 miles per hour, and the temperature dropped to around 11 degrees. The Blizzard of '78 chronicles how countless lives were disrupted and how some were lost. \n\n\nThe storm caught many residents off guard. The night before it started many people thought of the incoming storm as just another winter disturbance - certainly nothing to worry about. But upon awaking the next morning, it was all too apparent, this was not a typical storm. \n\n\nGas, electric, and telephone service was lost in many areas and the storm was preventing city and utility workers from getting service restored. People fought for anything and everything to stay warm; some even tore apart and burned furniture in their effort to have some heat. Some people suffered carbon monoxide poisoning by using outdoor grills indoors for heat. \n\n\nAs is ofter the case, amid the horrific conditions, there are tales of heroism and humor along with the tragedy. The Blizzard of '78 tells these stories through firsthand accounts, home movies and archival photographs.",

This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal. The last three were all awarded by the now-extinct government of the Republic of Vietnam.  He received the PUC and the two Vietnamese unit citations as a member of 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment.

Eva Clarke was one of three \u201cmiracle babies\u201d who saw the light of day in KZ Mauthausen in Austria. Nine days after her birth, the Second World War ended. As a newborn, Eva\u2019s chances of survival were extremely slim; against all odds, she lived, making her and her mother Anka the only survivors of their extended family. In 1948, they emigrated from Prague to the UK and settled in Cardiff, Wales. Eva regularly addresses audiences, and her remarkable story has been featured in the British and American media. She and her mother are among the protagonists of Wendy Holden\u2019s book Born Survivors: Three Young Mothers and their Extraordinary Story of Courage, Defiance, and Hope (Harper, 2015).
