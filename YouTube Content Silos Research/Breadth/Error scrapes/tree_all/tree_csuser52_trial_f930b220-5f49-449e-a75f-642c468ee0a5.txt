He says that the illegal rave scene in the UK and lack of funding as a university student drove him to sell drugs on a larger scale. Pieter's operation eventually supplied many big time dealers in the UK. He then began importing cocaine from Ecuador to Europe through a cartel connection. Pieter was arrested in Ecuador and sentenced to 12 years in one of the worlds most violent and corrupt prisons. He now works as a public speaker on the dangers of drugs, and also presents a show on local radio station \u201cincapable staircase\u201d every Friday from 4-5:30 pm GMT.",

            "description": "Recorded at Fox News in NYC on October 28, 2021\n\nProfessor Glenn Loury is in social sciences and economics at Brown University and a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution. Prior to that, he became a tenured professor of economics at Harvard at the age of 33. How he got from there to here is an inspiring and fascinating story of hard work and accomplishment that is explored in great detail in this interview. Professor Loury also explains the crucial role his parents and his extended family played in his education and his opinions. Now, in his 70\u2019s Loury has become a leading spokesman on the right, often speaking out against woke culture prevalent on many campuses and other institutions. He also explains his radical (for an academic institution, at least) reading list and syllabus for the courses he teaches at Brown and how an undergraduate student/teaching assistant inspired Professor Loury to create a course intended to liberate his students from the \u201cgroupthink\u201d that is far too prevalent at most universities. \n\nFor further information: ",

Rufo, a contributing editor for City Journal and a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute, for an extended conversation on why he\u2019s a prominent opponent of Critical Race Theory being taught in schools.   \n\nRufo says Critical Race Theory is \u201cstate-sanctioned racism.\u201d   \n\n\u201cTeaching history, teaching context, teaching competing viewpoints is good. But what is not good is taking an ideology like Critical Race Theory, turning it into official dogma and then compelling students to believe in ideas like race essentialism, racial superiority theory,\u201d Rufo says.   \n\nHill pushes back on Rufo\u2019s claim that is what CRT teaches.   \n\n\u201cCritical race theorists hold that the law and legal institutions in the United States are inherently racist insofar as they function to create and maintain social, economic, and political inequalities between whites and nonwhites, especially African Americans,\u201d per Brittanica. \n\nTo watch BNC programming, visit ",

And for many Democrats, it\u2019s obvious that Republicans are thwarting progress toward a more equal society.\n\nBut what happens when Republicans aren\u2019t standing in the way?\n\nIn many states \u2014 including California, New York and Illinois \u2014 Democrats control all the levers of power. They run the government. They write the laws. And as we explore in the video above, they often aren\u2019t living up to their values.\n\nIn key respects, many blue states are actually doing worse than red states. It is in the blue states where affordable housing is often hardest to find, there are some of the most acute disparities in education funding and economic inequality is increasing most quickly.\n\nInstead of asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d Democrats need to spend more time pondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with California?\u201d\n\nSubscribe: ",
