After being exposed, he turned FBI informant and has since stayed in the United States, becoming a published author of \"Deep Undercover\" and an expert on espionage and Russian intelligence. He was recruited into the KGB after being approached by a member of the East German secret police at the University of Jena in 1969.  \n\nBarsky rates the realism of Russian spying tactics such as message interception, surveillance, and sleeper cells in \"The Fourth Protocol\" (1987), \"Anna\" (2019), \"Bridge of Spies\" (2015), \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" (2011), and the popular TV show \"The Americans\" (2013-2018). \n\nHe also breaks down physical training and spies' backgrounds in \"Red Sparrow\" (2018), \"Salt\" (2010), and Black Widow's first on-screen appearance in \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). He also discusses the Bond movie franchise and its depiction of Russian spies in \"From Russia With Love\" (1963).\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nSAS Soldier Breaks Down 11 Military Scenes",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

            "description": "Civil discourse is in decline, with potentially dire results for American democracy.\n\nOn college campuses across America, visiting speakers are disinvited, or even shouted down, while professors, students, and administrators are afraid to talk openly, for fear that someone will take offense. Political discussion on social media and television has devolved into a wave of hyper-partisan noise. A generation of overprotective parents are reluctant to let their children play outside without supervision. How did we get here? And how can we change the way that we engage with one another?\n\nGreg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt\u2019s The Coddling of the American Mind sounds the depths of this generational crisis. Join us for a lively discussion with the authors, president of the non-profit Let Grow and founder of the Free-Range Kids movement Lenore Skenazy, and #1 New York Times bestseller Malcolm Gladwell on how we as citizens can engage with one another across the political spectrum.\n\nRecorded on January 16, 2019 at 92nd Street Y.\n\nSubscribe for more videos like this: ",

Unbeknownst to some, the original concept for Diablo called for a traditional, turn-based RPG - a genre Brevik came of age with and was heavily influenced by. However, following a fateful vote by show of hands at the Blizzard North offices, Diablo became something new entirely and an initially reluctant David Brevik was on the cusp of creating the first entry in a legendary action role-playing series.\n\nFootage used in this video:\nApple 2 programming tutorial",

And for many Democrats, it\u2019s obvious that Republicans are thwarting progress toward a more equal society.\n\nBut what happens when Republicans aren\u2019t standing in the way?\n\nIn many states \u2014 including California, New York and Illinois \u2014 Democrats control all the levers of power. They run the government. They write the laws. And as we explore in the video above, they often aren\u2019t living up to their values.\n\nIn key respects, many blue states are actually doing worse than red states. It is in the blue states where affordable housing is often hardest to find, there are some of the most acute disparities in education funding and economic inequality is increasing most quickly.\n\nInstead of asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d Democrats need to spend more time pondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with California?\u201d\n\nSubscribe: ",
