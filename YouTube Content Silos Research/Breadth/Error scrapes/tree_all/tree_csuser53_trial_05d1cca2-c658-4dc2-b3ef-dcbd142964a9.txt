He turned to bank robbery after threats to his family by a dangerous gang. He was nicknamed the \"kangaroo bandit,\" having been captured on CCTV stuffing cash into a backpack worn on his chest. He says he robbed over 100 banks across California between 1999 and 2001. He eventually turned himself in and served nine years in prison after pleading guilty to six robberies. He now works as a life coach and motivational speaker, helping newly released prisoners reintegrate into society. He's also a partner in two production companies. \n\nMORE INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Drug Gangs Actually Work | How Crime Works",
