This decision was announced in Red Square in front of numerous crowds of people: \u201cMichael Fyodorovich shall be tsar and lord of Muscovy and all the Russian state.\u201d In order to prevent disturbances, Michael Romanov had to take a terrible sin upon his soul \u2013 to execute a 3 year-old boy\u2026 \n\nThe most vivid pages of Russian history and the establishment and consolidation of Russian state power are associated with the eighteen Russian Tsars of the House of Romanov which include such historic names as Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Nicholas I and Alexanders I, II and III. The dynasty ended with the brutal assassination of the last Tsar, Nicholas II and his family by the Bolsheviks in Ekaterinburg in 1917.\n\nThe Romanov dynasty played a hugely important role in world history, and the series highlights the life stories and characters of the tsars, recounting their rise to power and their contribution to the dynasty, their merits and their faults, their achievements and mistakes, their victories and defeats in war.\n\nThe series also examines the Russian form of 'Caesarism' as a system of state administration - its advantages and drawbacks and how the Russian state changed under the Romanov's rule.\n\nTHE ROMANOVS is told in eight epic one-hour episodes using a unique combination of magnificent CGI animation and dramatic reconstruction with careful and accurate attention paid to each period.\n\nType: TV series\nGenre: docudrama\nYear of production: 2013\nDuration: 8x52 minutes\nDirected by: Maksim Bespalyi\nWritten by: Marina Bandilenko, Marina Ulybysheva\nDirector of photography: Ivan Barkhvart\nProducers: Valeriy Babich, Vlad Ryashin, Sergey Titinkov, Konstantin Ernst\n\nWatch movies and TV series for free in high quality.\nExplore a great collection of documentaries.\n\nThe best Russian movies and tv series, melodrama, war movies, military tv shows, new russian films, top documentary films and full movies with english subtitle.\n\nWith these free online Russian language movies you will learn Russian easily.\nSubscribe for high quality movies and series on our channel.\nEnjoy Watching!",

                        "description": "With more board configurations than there are atoms in the universe, the ancient Chinese game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. \n\nOn March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.\n\nDirected by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?\n\nFind out more: ",

But last November, in the middle of the night, about 200 members of the sect fled their homes in Quebec to start a new community in Chatham, Ontario, amid allegations of child neglect.  Now the sect is fighting to keep more than a dozen children that a Quebec court ordered removed from their families. Recently released search warrants show Quebec provincial police have been investigating allegations of unlawful confinement and physical abuse of children within the sect, as well as marriage of underage girls to much older men.\n\nTheir ongoing legal battles are raising an old dilemma: when does a group\u2019s right to religious freedom get trumped by society\u2019s obligation to protect children?  It\u2019s also prompted a lot of questions about life inside the secluded community - and the past of its charismatic leader, Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans.  The fifth estate\u2019s team travelled from New York to Israel to investigate his murky history, and host Gillian Findlay spoke to people with an intimate knowledge of his past.  With unprecedented access to the community in Chatham, including first-hand footage of a police raid there and an extensive interview with Helbrans, \u2018Rabbi of the Pure Hearts: Inside Lev Tahor\u2019 reveals the challenges of life in the Jewish sect.\n\nA joint investigation with Radio Canada's Enquete program\n\nOriginal airdate : February 28th, 2014\n\nFor more on the fifth estate : ",

When he was 15 years old, he was told he had to marry his 12 year old cousin, and that was the last straw for him. \n\nMendy said the group, which was founded by Shlomo Helbrans in the 1980s, was about 'total control.'\n\n'You can't do anything without permission. And if they ask you do something, you have to do it,' he recalled to Insider. \n\n'They don't want people to see the outside world. No one is able to go anywhere without the leader's permission.'  \n\nMendy recalled a time when a woman, who was allergic to sesame seeds, was told she had to eat them after to prove 'her faith' to the rabbi.\n\n'Two hours later, she died,' he said. 'As she was suffering from the allergic reaction, they didn't let her call an ambulance. They don't allow doctors in Lev Tahor without the rabbi's permission. They told us to trust the rabbi.' \n\nSomething similar happened to his father - who developed an infection in 2016 and needed to go to the hospital. \n\n'The rabbi said no,' Mendy explained. 'My father wasn't eating. He wasn't walking. He got sicker and sicker over a week and a half. And that's how it ended. He died on October 25, 2016.' \n\nDuring his days at Lev Tahor, Mendy said he woke up at ",
