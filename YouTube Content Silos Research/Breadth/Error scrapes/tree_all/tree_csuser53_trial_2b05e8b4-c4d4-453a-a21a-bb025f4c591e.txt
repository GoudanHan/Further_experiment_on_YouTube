There are over 400 bat species that are likely to carry undetected betacoronaviruses. Betacoronavirus is one of the four genera of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and the other three are alpha, gamma and delta. Scientists are using computer models with machine learning to identify potential hosts of pathogens. Daniel Becker, Assistant Professor at the University of Oklahoma and one of the study\u2019s author tested different models to predict the potential host of  betacoronaviruses. Between 2020 and 2021, Becker and his team identified 47 more bat species likely to carry undetected betacoronaviruses .Overall, the team predicted that nearly 410 bat species are likely to carry betacoronaviruses. The researchers also identified hotspots of likely bat hosts of betacoronaviruses including the Malay Archipelago, Europe and parts of America. The team is now working with other researchers to test bat samples for coronaviruses.",

For three nail-biting seconds it looked as if the mission would have to be aborted. However, Armstrong was given a \"go\" to continue, and after several more alarms the Eagle touched down safely on the Moon.\n\nRobert Wills introduces the amazing hardware and software that made up the Apollo Guidance Computer, walks you through the landing procedure step-by-step, and talks about the pioneering design principles that were used to make the landing software robust against any failure. He also explains the problems that occurred during the Apollo 11 landing, and shows you how the Apollo Guidance Computer played its part in saving the mission.\n\nChapters:",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",

The HyperCard-developed title ran into some snags when trying to run on the CD-ROM format. \"I had a really powerful Mac, with a lot of memory and a lot of hard drive space, and we were still working in mud,\" said Rand, discussing the game's performance early-on. Rand and his brother, Robyn, compressed the image and audio data as much as they could so the game could run smoothly on 1x CD-ROM drives.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",
