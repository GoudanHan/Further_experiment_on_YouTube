Klatt then discusses the Jim Harbaugh situation and breaks down the motive for leaving Michigan if he decides to pursue other opportunities, along with USC's quarterback plans under Lincoln Riley.",

This comes after a long, intense, gruelling career dating all the way back to 2012. Jimmy Donaldson AKA Mr Beast has seen it all.\n\nFrom playing Minecraft and expecting no subscribers back in the early days, to setting world records with Squid Game in 2021, Mr Beast's history is certainly something to behold.\n\nThis is, the entire history of MrBeast, i guess.\n\nVideo inspired by bill wurtz and sipover / sipovers :)\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, Sunny XO \u2764\n\nThumbnail art done by: malihaartixt /via fiver",

Joe Biden is getting enormous amounts of backlash for his COVID vaccine mandate. While the Biden administration is resorting to force to deal with vaccine hesitancy to fight the Delta variant it was not long ago he was questioning the COVID 19 vaccine. Dave shares video of Kamala Harris, Dr. Fauci, and Joe Biden all being skeptical of the vaccine when it was under the Trump administration. Dave also questions why there is a vaccine mandate exemption for members of congress and their staff.\n\nWatch Dave's FULL DIRECT MESSAGE here:",
