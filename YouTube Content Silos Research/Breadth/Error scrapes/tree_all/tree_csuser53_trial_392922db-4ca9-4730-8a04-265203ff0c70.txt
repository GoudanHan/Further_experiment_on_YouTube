He\u2019s also been speaking and writing about climate science for almost 20 years. In this wide-ranging discussion with Peter Robinson, Lomborg analyzes the Biden administration\u2019s plan to address climate change, lauds a slew of new clean energy technologies that are coming in the next decade, and discusses the upsides\u2014and the downsides\u2014of migrating the world from a carbon-based economy to one based on electricity generated by clean energy sources. \n\nFor further information: ",
