Yet Senator Elizabeth Warren claims that Elon isn't paying any taxes. Furious about this, Elon Musk has taken to twitter to fight back against Warren while at the same time exposing her corrupt behaviour, showing that she herself has not paid tax, while in fact Elon Musk will be paying more tax this year than any individual throughout history.",
