However, as what I have seen right here about DOEX which is the first ever AMM-based decentralized exchange under the Cardano blockchain, it seems that they're going to show a lot of promise despite that their product is still under development after finishing both their private and public sale.\n\nBut the question is if DOEX is reliable and can solve many issues that we have in the other AMMs and DEXs that we have experienced? You think that they're really worth our time and money in using their platform? In this video review of mine, I'm going to share five interesting reasons that I've honestly liked the most about their upcoming AMM-based DEX platform. \n\nI suggest that you should be watching my kinda \"entertaining\" video review about DOEX until the end of this video.\n----------------------\n\ud83d\udc65 Follow DOEX's official channels:  \nTwitter: ",
