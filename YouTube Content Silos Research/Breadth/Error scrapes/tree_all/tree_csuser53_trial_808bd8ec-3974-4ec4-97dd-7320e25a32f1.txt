This is the notion that the positions of the stars and planets in the sky at the moment of your birth have an influence on your characteristics, and that their positions over time influence daily events. Can this be possible? By what mechanism does this influence propagate? If it's true, why haven't we encountered anything like this in our study of astronomy? Shouldn't we be able to do experiments to test its validity? We sure can. Let's take a real good look at what astrology proposes, and see if we can to the bottom of whether there is any truth to it or not.\n\nLarge-scale study showing no correlation between date of birth and personality: ",

            "description": "Anti-science mentality is rampant in this day and age, and one of the more peculiar aspects of this trend is the current fad that is the Flat Earth model. There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?\n\nWatch the whole Astronomy/Astrophysics playlist: ",

In this video I point out ten blatantly obvious and trivial things any flat earther could do to substantiate their model, that they totally never and will never do. It's hard to fathom that there are a few hundred of them left, maybe I can pick a few off with this one.\n\nMy original flat earth debunk: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
