                "description": "Today on War Stories, Ars Technica is joined by Dan Greenawalt, Creative Director of the Forza franchise, who takes us through the colossal potential (and many challenges) of utilizing deep neural networks to build sophisticated racing AI. Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for XBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer learning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the AI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza Motorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly evolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned how challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating realistic opponents.",

            "description": "Today on War Stories, Ars Technica is joined by Diablo lead programmer David Brevik to break down the genesis and development of a PC hack & slash masterpiece. Unbeknownst to some, the original concept for Diablo called for a traditional, turn-based RPG - a genre Brevik came of age with and was heavily influenced by. However, following a fateful vote by show of hands at the Blizzard North offices, Diablo became something new entirely and an initially reluctant David Brevik was on the cusp of creating the first entry in a legendary action role-playing series.\n\nFootage used in this video:\nApple 2 programming tutorial",

The HyperCard-developed title ran into some snags when trying to run on the CD-ROM format. \"I had a really powerful Mac, with a lot of memory and a lot of hard drive space, and we were still working in mud,\" said Rand, discussing the game's performance early-on. Rand and his brother, Robyn, compressed the image and audio data as much as they could so the game could run smoothly on 1x CD-ROM drives.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",
