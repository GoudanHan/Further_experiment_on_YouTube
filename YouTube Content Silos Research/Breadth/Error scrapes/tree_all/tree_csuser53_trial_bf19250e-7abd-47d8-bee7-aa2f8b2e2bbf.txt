With a one in a million chance of meeting one of only 6,000 astrophysicists in the world, audience members were lined up in order to have the opportunity to ask Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson a question on any and all galactic wonders they may have.\n\nAbout St. Petersburg College:\nIn 1927, St. Petersburg College (then known as St. Petersburg Junior College) became Florida's first private, non-profit, two-year school of higher learning located in downtown St. Petersburg. Full accreditation followed in 1931 and in 1948 SPC became a public college. \nIn June 2001, SPJC officially became St. Petersburg College when Florida's governor signed legislation making it the first community college in Florida to offer four-year degrees. On Dec. 11, 2001, the college received the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' accreditation to offer courses leading to bachelor's degrees.\nIn 2002, St. Petersburg College began offering courses leading to bachelor's degrees in Education, Nursing and Technology Management. The college's commitment to its two-year curriculum, which has earned it wide recognition and annually wins it high national rankings, remains as strong as ever.\nToday, SPC has eight learning sites throughout Pinellas County and recently became the first college in Florida to offer a four-year degree in Dental Hygiene. This program's offerings augment its two-year program, which has been in operation since 1963. SPC added four-year degrees in Veterinary Technology, Public Safety Administration and Orthotics and Prosthetics in 2005.\nCollege Accreditation\nSt. Petersburg College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associates degrees and to offer courses leading to bachelor's degrees in the following areas: Banking, Nursing, Business Administration, Orthotics & Prosthetics, Elementary/Secondary Education, Paralegal Studies. Educational Studies. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certification. Dental Hygiene. Public Safety Administration. Health Services Administration. Sustainability Management. International Business. Technology Management. Management & Organizational Leadership. Veterinary Technology.\n \nSPC also offers access to junior and senior level courses for bachelors and graduate degrees at the University Partnership Center. The UPC partners with the University of South Florida, University of South Florida at St. Petersburg, Eckerd College, University of Florida, Florida State University, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, University of Central Florida, Florida International University, Florida A&M University, Saint Leo University, Florida Gulf Coast University, Florida Institute of Technology, Barry University, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland State University, Indiana University, and St. Petersburg College.",

This video was recorded at The Australian National University on 10 April 2012.\n\nRichard Dawkins FRS is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford. Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.\n\nHe is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.\n\nRichard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He has been awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the Nakayama Prize, the Cosmos International Prize, the Kistler Prize, the Shakespeare Prize and the Lewis Thomas Prize.\n\nLawrence M. Krauss is a renowned cosmologist and science populariser, and is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is also the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and nine books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and his most recent bestseller entitled A Universe from Nothing.\n\nHe received his PhD from MIT in 1982 and then joined the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and was a professor at Yale University and Chair of the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University before taking his present position. Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist and Scientific American and appears regularly on radio and television. He is one of the few scientists to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, and is also active in issues of science and society. He serves as co-chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and on the Board of Directors of the Federation of American Scientists.",

And if you don\u2019t know who he is, you have our permission to take in this episode twice. In this episode, we talk about why an interest in science serves every field of expertise (from law to art), what education should ideally train us for, why Neil likes writing with fountain pens, what Neil sees as evidence of the supreme height of illiteracy prevalent in the era of the smartphone, how support for science has historically been bipartisan over the course of American history, how science denial has gained a global foothold by \u2014 ironically enough \u2014 the use of that very science, why Neil rarely interviews other scientists on his StarTalk podcast, what Neil has to say in rebuttal to Walt Whitman, what it\u2019ll take for the US to get to Mars before China, why it\u2019s dangerous for people to claim the Earth is flat, and lots more.

            "description": "This episode was recorded on May 7th 2021\n\nOn this episode of the Jordan Peterson Podcast, Jordan is accompanied by American-Canadian theoretical physicist and cosmologist Lawrence M. Krauss. Throughout his career, Dr. Krauss has made remarkable contributions to the field of research on particle physics and cosmology. Dr. Krauss formerly worked at Yale University, Case Western Reserve University, and Arizona State University. Dr. Krauss also founded ASU\u2019s Origins Project, a non-profit corporation that holds public panel discussions on science, culture, and social issues. Some of his work includes popular books such as The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing.\n\nJordan and Lawrence sit down to discuss a variety of topics in the mind-boggling world of quantum physics. They spend time discussing generated models of the beginning of our universe, the lawbreaking complexities of quantum physics, the ramifications related to entropy, the usefulness of the scientific method, as well as the instinctive behaviour for religious compulsion among human beings.\n\nThe Jordan B. Peterson Podcast can be found at",

            "description": "On January 26th at the University of Toronto 1500 people packed into Convocation Hall to watch a fascinating dialogue on the meaning of life featuring philosopher William Lane Craig, psychology professor Dr. Jordan Peterson, and philosopher and author Dr. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein (moderated by journalist Karen Stiller).\n\nThis dialogue is part of the ongoing Religion and Society Series - previously featuring speakers such as Lawrence Krauss, Alister McGrath, and Michael Shermer; check out the Wycliffe College YouTube channel to watch the previous dialogues; for more information about the series go here: www.wycliffecollege.ca/religionandsociety. For media inquiries, please contact Wycliffe College\u2019s Communications Director, Patricia Paddey or Program Director, Steve Hewko. \n\n(Hosts and sponsoring organizations are committed to a manner of discourse that respects the dignity of all human beings, and do not necessarily endorse the perspectives or opinions of the speakers). \n\nDr. William Lane Craig is a Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology and Professor of Philosophy at Houston Baptist University. He has authored or edited over thirty books, including The Kalam Cosmological Argument; Assessing the New Testament Evidence for the Historicity of the Resurrection of Jesus; Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom; Theism, Atheism and Big Bang Cosmology; and God, Time and Eternity, as well as over a hundred articles in professional journals of philosophy and theology, including The Journal of Philosophy, New Testament Studies, Journal for the Study of the New Testament, American Philosophical Quarterly, Philosophical Studies, Philosophy, and British Journal for Philosophy of Science. In 2016 Dr. Craig was named by The Best Schools as one of the fifty most influential living philosophers. \n\nDr Rebecca Newberger Goldstein is an American philosopher, novelist, and public intellectual. Currently, she is Visiting Professor of Philosophy at New College of the Humanities, London, England.

In 2011, she delivered the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Yale University, and in 2005 was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She has won numerous awards, for both her fiction and scholarship, including, in 1995, a MacArthur Fellowship prize, popularly known in the U.S. as the Genius Award. In 2015, she was awarded the National Medal of the Humanities by President Obama in a ceremony at the White House. \n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson has taught mythology to lawyers, doctors and businessmen, consulted for the UN Secretary General\u2019s High Level Panel on Sustainable Development, helped his clinical clients manage depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and schizophrenia, served as an advisor to senior partners of major Canadian law firms, identified thousands of promising entrepreneurs on six different continents, and lectured extensively in North America and Europe. With his students and colleagues, Dr. Peterson has published more than a hundred scientific papers, transforming the modern understanding of personality, and revolutionized the psychology of religion with his now-classic book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief. As a Harvard professor, he was nominated for the prestigious Levinson Teaching Prize, and is regarded by his current University of Toronto students as one of three truly life-changing teachers. \n\nMODERATOR\nKaren Stiller is a freelance writer and editor, and senior editor of Faith Today, Canada\u2019s Christian magazine.
