PO Thornton, as Assistant U.S. Navy Advisor, along with a U.S. Navy lieutenant serving as Senior Advisor, accompanied a 3-man Vietnamese Navy SEAL patrol on an intelligence gathering and prisoner capture operation against an enemy-occupied naval river base. Launched from a Vietnamese Navy junk in a rubber boat, the patrol reached land and was continuing on foot toward its objective when it suddenly came under heavy fire from a numerically superior force. The patrol called in naval gunfire support and then engaged the enemy in a fierce firefight, accounting for many enemy casualties before moving back to the waterline to prevent encirclement. Upon learning that the Senior Advisor had been hit by enemy fire and was believed to be dead, PO Thornton returned through a hail of fire to the lieutenant's last position; quickly disposed of 2 enemy soldiers about to overrun the position, and succeeded in removing the seriously wounded and unconscious Senior Naval Advisor to the water's edge. He then inflated the lieutenant's lifejacket and towed him seaward for approximately 2 hours until picked up by support craft. By his extraordinary courage and perseverance, PO Thornton was directly responsible for saving the life of his superior officer and enabling the safe extraction of all patrol members, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\nLearn more about the American Veterans Center: ",

While it is true that Reagan was not president in 1991, that portion of the video is simply the citation and presentation of the MOH to MSG Benavidez which was played to introduce him to the stage prior to the speech. \nNotice a few things that should help clarify:\n\nDuring the citation, the setting is outside. During the speech, it is inside. \n\nDuring the citation, MSG Benavidez is wearing his full Class A uniform including his beret. During the speech, he is downgraded to a Class B uniform (no jacket) and is not wearing his beret.\n\nDuring the citation, President Regan is present. During the speech, he is not. \n\nThe reason for all of these massive and obvious differences is that the speech was not given in 1981 when Regan was president. It was, again and exactly as stated in the title, given a decade later. In 1991.",
