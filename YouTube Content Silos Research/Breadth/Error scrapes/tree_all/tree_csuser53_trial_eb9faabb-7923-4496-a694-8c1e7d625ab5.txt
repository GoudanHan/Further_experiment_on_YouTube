The HyperCard-developed title ran into some snags when trying to run on the CD-ROM format. \"I had a really powerful Mac, with a lot of memory and a lot of hard drive space, and we were still working in mud,\" said Rand, discussing the game's performance early-on. Rand and his brother, Robyn, compressed the image and audio data as much as they could so the game could run smoothly on 1x CD-ROM drives.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",
