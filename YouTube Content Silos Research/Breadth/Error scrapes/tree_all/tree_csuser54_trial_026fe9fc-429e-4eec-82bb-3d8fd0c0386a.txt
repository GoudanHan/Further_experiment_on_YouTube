                        "description": "Jack Bogle transformed the investment management industry. Over a career lasting nearly half a century, Bogle was a crusader for individual investors, working to bring the interests of asset managers in line with those of their investment clients. \n\nIn 1975, Bogle founded the Vanguard Group, structuring the business as a mutual company, meaning that Vanguard is owned by the funds it manages and, as a result, the funds' investors. A year later, Bogle and Vanguard introduced the first ever index mutual fund available to the general public, aiming to track the performance of the broader market while charging the lowest fees possible. At first, many in the investment industry snickered at Vanguard's new index funds, but over time Bogle's idea took hold. While maintaining some of the lowest fees in the business, Vanguard has grown its assets under management from $1.8 billion at its founding to $5.3 trillion as of September 30, 2018, making Vanguard the second largest asset manager in the world.\n\nDespite Vanguard's incredible success, Bogle didn't become fantastically rich. Instead, Jack passed on as much savings as possible to Vanguard investors, bringing fees for his funds to razor-thin levels (and dragging the rest of the fund market with him). As a result, Bogle helped all investors get better returns on their retirement savings, drastically reducing underperformance caused by high management fees. As Bogle said in 2012, \"My ideas are very simple. In investing, you get what you don't pay for.\"\n\nAll investors are indebted to Jack Bogle for his efforts over 40+ years to make the investment industry better serve the interests of individuals. As we remember Bogle's life and his contributions, we hope you'll enjoy this conversation between Bogle and Motley Fool Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner recorded in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe to The Motley Fool's YouTube Channel: ",

Every spring the pond reawakens with new life and beauty, and every year the UChicago community returns to visit the scenic corner of campus. \n\nThe historic Botany Pond was created as an outdoor research laboratory at the turn of the 20th century by John Merle Coulter, chair of the Department of Botany. In 2004\u2014with funding from the Julie and Parker Hall Botanic Garden Endowment Fund\u2014it underwent a major restoration, allowing it to remain a source of academic study, inspiration, and serenity for the UChicago community. \n\nBotany Pond remains a beloved campus space, enjoyed for its biodiversity that includes water lilies, ginko and akebia trees, turtles, fish, ducks\u2014and even the occasional heron.

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",
