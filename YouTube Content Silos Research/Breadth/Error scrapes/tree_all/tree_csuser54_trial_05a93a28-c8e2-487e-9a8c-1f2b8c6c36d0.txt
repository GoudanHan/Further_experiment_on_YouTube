The documentary 97% Owned aims to answer questions like: Where does the money come from? Who creates it? Who decides how it gets used? And what does that mean for the millions of ordinary people who suffer when money and finance break down?\n97% Owned reveals how the creation of credit and the mystery that surrounds it. The documentary goes at the root of our current social and economic crisis. Referring to the 97% of the world\u2019s money supply that is represented by credit, this thought-provoking film presents serious research and verifiable evidence on our economic and financial system. Featuring frank interviews and commentary from economists, campaigners and former bankers, it exposes the privatized, debt-based monetary system that gives banks the power to create money, shape the economy, cause crises and push house prices out of reach. Fact-based and clearly explained, 97% Owned demonstrates how the power to create money is the piece of the puzzle that economists were missing when they failed to predict the crisis.\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: ",

For three nail-biting seconds it looked as if the mission would have to be aborted. However, Armstrong was given a \"go\" to continue, and after several more alarms the Eagle touched down safely on the Moon.\n\nRobert Wills introduces the amazing hardware and software that made up the Apollo Guidance Computer, walks you through the landing procedure step-by-step, and talks about the pioneering design principles that were used to make the landing software robust against any failure. He also explains the problems that occurred during the Apollo 11 landing, and shows you how the Apollo Guidance Computer played its part in saving the mission.\n\nChapters:",

In Outliers we\u0393\u00c7\u00d6re going to visit a genius who lives on a horse farm in Northern Missouri. We\u0393\u00c7\u00d6re going to examine the bizarre histories of professional hockey players and look into the peculiar childhood of Bill Gates and spend time in a Chinese rice paddy.  We will investigate the world\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s greatest law firm and wonder about what distinguishes pilots who crash planes from those who don\u0393\u00c7\u00d6t.
