Yes, after the first two iCarly videos, we now begin our voyage into Victorious: famous, or infamous? You decide. Starring Victoria Justice, Ariana Grande, Liz Gillies, Avan Jogia, and Christopher Cane, the show has amassed quite a legacy over the years, and people are even pining for a Victorious reboot these days. Today we start our journey with very little context, but trust me when I say we quickly become immersed in the details.\n\nTimecodes:",
