In this programme we examine how Japan's surrender was a complicated and difficult process involving a military coup and how America was reluctantly faced with potentially using the third bomb - but which city was to be targeted? And would it have ended the war?\n\nDr. Mark Felton is a well-known British historian, the author of 22 non-fiction books, including bestsellers 'Zero Night' and 'Castle of the Eagles', both currently being developed into movies in Hollywood. In addition to writing, Mark also appears regularly in television documentaries around the world, including on The History Channel, Netflix, National Geographic, Quest, American Heroes Channel and RMC Decouverte. His books have formed the background to several TV and radio documentaries. More information about Mark can be found at: ",

                        "description": "First published in 1898, \u201cFutility, or the Wreck of the Titan\u201d is often seen as a spooky foreshadowing of the sinking of the Titanic 14 years later. Undeniably, the similarities are there - a \u201cvirtually unsinkable ship\u201d sailing the Atlantic crashes into an iceberg in April, going down with a significant loss of life, and - of course - the name of the ship being Titan. But objectively speaking, just how much of this is eerie versus being the case of an author observing the trends of the ocean liner industry and building a fictional story based on what he saw? \n\nLet\u2019s dive into a reading of the book, chapter by chapter, and break down what\u2019s coincidental, and what the author may have drawn upon to create this tale of fiction. \n\nAnd, let\u2019s have some wine along the way!",

But it wasn't the accumulation that was a problem. Winds gusted at 60 miles per hour, and the temperature dropped to around 11 degrees. The Blizzard of '78 chronicles how countless lives were disrupted and how some were lost. \n\n\nThe storm caught many residents off guard. The night before it started many people thought of the incoming storm as just another winter disturbance - certainly nothing to worry about. But upon awaking the next morning, it was all too apparent, this was not a typical storm. \n\n\nGas, electric, and telephone service was lost in many areas and the storm was preventing city and utility workers from getting service restored. People fought for anything and everything to stay warm; some even tore apart and burned furniture in their effort to have some heat. Some people suffered carbon monoxide poisoning by using outdoor grills indoors for heat. \n\n\nAs is ofter the case, amid the horrific conditions, there are tales of heroism and humor along with the tragedy. The Blizzard of '78 tells these stories through firsthand accounts, home movies and archival photographs.",
