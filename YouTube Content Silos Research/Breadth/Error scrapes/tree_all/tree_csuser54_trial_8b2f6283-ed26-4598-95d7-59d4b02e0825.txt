Denman has deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq 15 times, and he currently runs War Office Productions, advising filmmakers on all-things tactical. Keep an eye out for the film he worked on most recently, \"The Outpost\" based on the Battle of Kamdesh, where Staff Sergeant Clinton Romesha and Staff Sergeant Ty Carter were both awarded the Medal of Honor. Needless to say, Jariko has some legit experience under his belt.\nWe're guessing you already know our buddy, Mat.\nSince they're both Rangers, we obviously had to hit Black Hawk Down. We also caught Ronin and 3 Kings. What movies should we grab next time around?\nIf you love Jariko as much as we do, check out our brand new podcast Free Range American where we brought him on board to pick his brain!",

Denman has deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq 15 times, and he currently runs War Office Productions, advising filmmakers on all-things tactical. Keep an eye out for the film he worked on most recently, \"The Outpost\" based on the Battle of Kamdesh, where Staff Sergeant Clinton Romesha and Staff Sergeant Ty Carter were both awarded the Medal of Honor. Needless to say, Jariko has some legit experience under his belt.\nWe're guessing you already know our buddy, Mat.\nSince they're both Rangers, we obviously had to hit Black Hawk Down. We also caught Ronin and 3 Kings. What movies should we grab next time around?\nIf you love Jariko as much as we do, check out our brand new podcast Free Range American where we brought him on board to pick his brain!",
