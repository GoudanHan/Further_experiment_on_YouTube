I felt so strongly for Vi - for Powder too, of course. But I felt for Vi in the position of a big sister and a leader who's trying to do the right thing - leaving Powder behind to protect her, stepping away to grieve - only to have it blow up in her face, and for their relationship to be irreparable.\n\nFIND ME ONLINE:\nInstagram: ",
