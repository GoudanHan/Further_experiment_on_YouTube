Todd Kohlhepp had a very thoughtout and evil way of handling his business.  Not only did he murder people throught a span of years, but he also taunted them  by posting on their social media and even went as far as posting reviews on amazon of items he used for his crimes, hence the name, the AMAZON REVIEW K!LLER. \n\nShould the interrogator have been so friendly and almost compassionate with Todd after the interrogation when they were having lunch?  Would you behave the same way being in the same room with a serial killer?\n\nCheck out the original video and Subscribe to EXPLORE WITH US here:",
