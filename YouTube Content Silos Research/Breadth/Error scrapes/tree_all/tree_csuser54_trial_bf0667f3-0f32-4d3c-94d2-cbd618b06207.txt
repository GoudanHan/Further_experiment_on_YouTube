Should socialism get another look in this country? How should we structure our economy to ensure freedom, equality, and prosperity?\n\nHere to debate these urgent questions are two of the most influential thinkers on political economy today: economist Richard D. Wolff and bestselling author and Harvard professor Arthur C. Brooks.\n\nProfessor Wolff has established himself as one of the leading scholars making the case for a new socialist approach to political economy.\n\nProfessor Brooks, one of America\u2019s best-known and most respected social scientists, has conducted extensive research on fighting poverty, promoting equal opportunity, entrepreneurship, free enterprise, and related issues.\n\nThis debate, part of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute\u2019s Diana Davis Spencer Debate Series, was recorded live on Thursday, April 15, 2021.\n\nInterested in more events like this?
