Relaunched in 2002 in a longer format, it pulled in an international audience of around 150 million viewers around the world. Irreverent, witty and unbiasedly honest, the Top Gear team and The Stig take cars to the limit and beyond to find out if they're any good or not. If you want to know how big the boot is, look elsewhere. Full of stunts, challenges and special features, Top Gear is self-deprecating, inclusive and passionate, giving authoritative information, entertainment and no little style.",
