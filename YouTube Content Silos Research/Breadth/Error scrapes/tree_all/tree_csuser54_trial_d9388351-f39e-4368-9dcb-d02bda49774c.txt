Many conceal their illness because of the stigma.\n\nDoctor and microbiologist Suniti Solomon was a pioneer in India in the field of HIV and AIDs. She diagnosed the first AIDs cases on the subcontinent among prostitutes in Chennai. But she also made a name for herself because of her matchmaking. She gave new hope to patients who had become isolated because of the social stigma attached to the disease, bringing together countless couples, such as Karthik and Manu. With the doctor\u2019s help, they found each other, a new life, and a new outlook on living with HIV.

Warmbier was released the following year, but he died of brain damage shortly after his return to the United States. Was he really the victim of torture?\n\nOtto Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2016 after being convicted of attempting to steal a propaganda poster during a trip to Pyongyang. Just over a year on he was dead, having been sent home to the US in a vegetative state. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been \"tortured beyond belief \" in North Korea. The US president blamed both the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the Obama administration for Warmbier\u2019s death - and Trump appeared before the media with the student\u2019s parents. This was at the peak of the North Korean missile crisis. Later, as relations between Trump and Kim Jong Un became warmer, the US president changed his tune. In 2019 Trump said that he believed that Kim did not know what happened to the US student much to the consternation of Warmbier\u2019s parents. \n\nWhat really happened to Otto Warmbier in North Korea? Veteran foreign correspondent Klaus Scherer sets out to try to find out. In the documentary, Scherer interviews a number of people with knowledge of the case who have been largely unheard up to now. He shows that a US court investigating a liability case against North Korea brought by Warmbier\u2019s parents also ignored important witnesses, who continue to cast doubt on the torture allegations. These include the coroner in Cincinnati who examined Warmbier\u2019s body. She believes that the account given by North Korean doctors is credible. They claim that Warmbier had inadvertently been given too high a dose of sedatives by prison staff. This, the medics say was the cause of his state of unresponsive wakefulness. Could Trump\u2019s initial torture charges simply have been motivated by political opportunism?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.\n\nMany people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s.

The impoverishment of the American middle class is brutal. In a country that established liberalism as a creed, there is no safety net. For those who lose their jobs, the consequences are instantaneous and dramatic.\n\nLarry Dodson, 52, used to manage a large customer service department. But two years ago he lost his job and house. Today he lives in a motel room with his wife and two children and scraps by on $820 dollars a month, welcoming tourists to Disney World. After he has paid the motel fees, he\u2019s left with just $70 for food and other necessities.\n\nTerry used to be a sales manager and enjoyed a good life until he was made redundant. He ended up roaming from motel to motel in his car and eventually was judged \u2019economically incapable\u2019 of raising his six children. The three eldest were placed in foster care. There are currently 1,800 children growing up in the motels around Disney World. They move from school to school as their parents are forced to find cheaper accommodation.\n\nWe spent six months following the daily life of families likes these, affected by the crisis.\n\nThis documentary was first released in 2012. \n\n---\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more amazing stories, including free FULL documentaries.

And with good reason \u2014 South Africa's 2012-2013 crime statistics were the worst in a decade, with increases in murder, attempted murder, violent armed robbery, and carjackings.\n\nFear of crime has led to a boom in South Africa's private security industry since apartheid ended 20 years ago. The field's quick expansion is largely a result of continued social and economic inequality, increased violence, and inept police forces.\n\nVICE News traveled to South Africa's mother city Cape Town to look at the lifestyle gap between those who can and cannot afford the luxury of safety.\n\nCheck out the VICE News beta for more: ",

            "description": "In the countryside of South Africa, the white farmer is still at the helm, as if nothing had changed after the abolition of Apartheid. But there is unrest in the townships. How long can the farmers imagine themselves to be a chosen people?\nWhen Bram interviews him, Julius Malema sounds pretty reasonable. White farmers do not have to be afraid, says the politician who started ANC for himself after a career in governing party ANC. Their knowledge is very valuable. He only wants to ensure through sales that much more land comes into the hands of black farmers.\n\nMalema sounds slightly different on stage. He calls for example: If we have to die to claim our country, then that is only true. Or even: Shoot to kill! Kill the farmer! He gives a voice to the frustration that many blacks have. Twenty years after the abolition of Apartheid, little has changed in rural areas. Almost all the land is in the hands of whites. How do they themselves think about it?\n\nIn a village where Bram has been more often, the atmosphere is bitter. There has just been a robbery, the umpteenth. Every farmer has firearms, high fences and steel doors here. And there is patrolled at night. Are farmers the victims of ordinary crime, or are they conscious attempts to drive them from the land they have been living on for generations?\n\nThey are convinced of the latter themselves. A farmer's wife: \"They want to frighten us. They break in and wait until you come home. Then they shoot the man and rape the woman. \"But these emigrants do not think of emigration. Not even after a violent robbery: \"I was born here and I will be buried here.\"\n\nThe black residents of the area are also embittered. Life is bad here, says a man. He has no job - the farmers prefer to hire servants from other countries in Africa, because according to them they work harder and do not drink. In the stone house that he received as compensation for a shooting, he can not flush the toilet due to lack of water. And through the fences that are everywhere in the surrounding country, he feels as if he is locked up. He also thinks he can not live anywhere else than here.\n\nDoes Julius Malema get his way and the white domination of the South African countryside becomes something of the past? For the time being, he certainly does not have the say, because at the elections in May this year his party won 6.35 percent of the votes. The ANC almost ten times as much, so that party is still supreme.\n\nStraight Through Africa\nEpisode 2 - The promised land\n\nIn the South African countryside white farmers are still in charge, as if nothing has changed since Apartheid was abolished. But there\u2019s unrest in the townships. How long can the farmers continue to consider themselves a chosen people?\n\nDirector: Doke Romeijn and Stefanie de Brouwer\nSeptember 2014\n\nOn VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.\nVPRO Documentary publishes one new subtitled documentary about current affairs, finance, sustainability, climate change or politics every week.
