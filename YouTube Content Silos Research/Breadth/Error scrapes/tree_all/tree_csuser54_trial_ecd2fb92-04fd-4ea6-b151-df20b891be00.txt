Then he repeats\u2026 fighting for the soul of a nation\u2014this is a line that he started using in at least 2019\u2026 This doesn\u2019t resonate with moderates, with independents, the very people who were turned away from him. But then he also made up, you talked about the time he got arrested during a civil rights march. Just like he talked about he was arrested in South Africa once trying to\u2026 see Nelson Mandela. He, you know, defended the Black Panthers in court. These are all just fables that he spouts'\n\nSubscribe to Fox Business! ",

Between 1937 and 1947 over 20,000 of them were built and in those 10 years, Spitfires changed dramatically from the Mk 1 to the Mk 24. More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world. In this episode of Duxford in Depth, Graham Rodgers looks at how the Spitfire evolved by taking us through just a few of Duxford's collection of Spitfires including marks 1, 5, 9, 14, and 24.\n\nFrom 27 December until 20 February, see a world-first at IWM Duxford \u2013 the largest collection of Spitfires ever assembled under one roof!
