                    "description": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company makes 24% of all the world's chips, and 92% of the most advanced ones found in today's iPhones, fighter jets and supercomputers. Now TSMC is building America's first 5-nanometer fabrication plant, hoping to reverse a decades-long trend of the U.S. losing chip manufacturing to Asia. CNBC got an exclusive tour of the $12 billion fab that will start production in 2024.\n\nAs the world grapples with an ongoing chip shortage, a quiet giant among chipmakers has committed to investing $100 billion over three years to ramp up production.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company may not be a household name, but with a market value of over $550 billion, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies. Now, it\u2019s leveraging its considerable resources to bring the world\u2019s most advanced chip manufacturing back to U.S. soil.\n\nCNBC got an exclusive tour of the $12 billion fabrication plant, or fab, in Phoenix, Arizona, where TSMC will start making 5-nanometer chips in 2024. The company says it will produce 20,000 wafers each month.\n\n\u201cThese are parts that are going to be used in lots of different places: CPUs, GPUs, IPUs, etc. They\u2019ll be used in smartphones,\u201d Rick Cassidy told CNBC. Cassidy is TSMC\u2019s chief strategy officer and the president and CEO of TSMC\u2019s project in Arizona.\n\nTSMC makes key components for everything from cellphones to F-35 fighter jets to NASA\u2019s Perseverance Rover mission to Mars. Earlier this month, it announced plans for a new factory in Japan, where it will produce chips with older technologies, for things like household devices and certain car components. TSMC is also Apple\u2019s exclusive provider of the most advanced chips inside every iPhone currently on the market and most Mac computers.\n\n\u201cBut they remain sort of in the background, in terms of end markets. So Apple gets all the accolades when a new phone comes out,\u201d said Joanne Itow, managing director of manufacturing at Semico Research.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re low-key. We let our products speak for themselves. Their success brings all the business that we could ever hope for,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nThe U.S. was the birthplace of advanced silicon, but for decades now, it\u2019s been losing market share to Asia, where 79% of the world\u2019s chip production happened in 2020, according to industry association SEMI. It calculated the U.S. was responsible for 12% of worldwide chip manufacturing last year, down from 37% in 1990. \n\nTSMC alone was responsible for 24% of the world\u2019s semiconductor output in 2020, up from 21% in 2019, according to the company. When it comes to the most advanced chips used in the latest iPhones, supercomputers and automotive AI, TSMC is responsible for 92% of production while Samsung is responsible for the other 8%, according to research group Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become almost a monopoly at the leading edge, and all of those manufacturing operations, for the most part, are out of Taiwan, Hsinchu. That becomes a matter of national importance for the United States, but not only the United States, but the Western world,\u201d said Christopher Rolland, Susquehanna\u2019s senior semiconductor analyst.\n\nAlong with cutting edge 3- and 5-nanometer chips, TSMC also makes larger chips for products such as electric toothbrushes and coffeemakers. Cars often use less-advanced 28- to 40-nanometer chips. All types of chips have been impacted by the shortage. Carmakers including GM and Toyota have paused production at some plants. And Apple is likely to slash its 2021 production targets for the iPhone 13, with orders for some models delayed by more than a month.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

        "description": "The pharmaceutical industry exerts a huge amount of influence on health policy. Some companies develop highly profitable drugs with public money, while others have been found to have covered up serious side effects.\n\nThe fight against Covid-19 is further fueling the greed of pharmaceutical companies. Does the industry\u2019s influence threaten public health systems? \n\nThe industry has seen major changes in the last decade. Most of the world\u2019s pharmaceuticals are produced by a handful of large corporations, so-called Big Pharma. They\u2019re richer and more powerful than ever. In some cases, they can even call the shots on governmental health policies. \n\nThis documentary is the result of more than a year of research, and brings together patients, whistleblowers, lawyers, doctors and politicians, as well as representatives of the industry. Large laboratories are accused of concealing or downplaying research results to maintain their monopolies. Take the manufacturer Sanofi, whose epilepsy drug Depakine triggered a scandal throughout Europe. In the US, Johnson & Johnson has had to stand trial for driving millions of people into opioid addiction. And Novartis is one of several companies now facing huge fines over improper practices in the treatment of macular degeneration, an eye disease.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry gets support from influential doctors. But only one-fifth of German doctors declare what they receive from drug companies. As the world battles the Coronavirus pandemic, this documentary also looks at the lobbying efforts of manufacturer Gilead, as it seeks approval for a promising drug developed largely with public money. Every company is vying to find the next miracle treatment that will help it succeed against the competition.",
