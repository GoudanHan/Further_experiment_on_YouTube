The reason I pinpoint this one is because we have so many examples of Johnson doing an admirable job at acting while crying, but in that scene she\u2019s suddenly delivering her lines like she just got home from the dentist.\n\nWritten and produced by Dan Olson\n\nDrip: ",

As the 1980's wound down, Mechner found himself fighting against not only the limitations of the Apple II hardware but the impending death of the platform itself. Decades later, Prince of Persia remains a classic example of how the constraints of early gaming led to solutions that advanced the artform.\n\nDirected and Produced by Justin Wolfson\nEdited/GFX by Parker Dixon\n\nFootage used in this video:\nAchievementX360Nerds:",
