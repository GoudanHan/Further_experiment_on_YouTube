Following the war, Piller becomes an investigator assigned the task of identifying and redistributing stolen art, resulting in the flamboyant van Meegeren being accused of collaboration \u2014 a crime punishable by death. But, despite mounting evidence, Piller, with the aid of his assistant (Vicky Krieps), becomes increasingly convinced of Han's innocence and finds himself in the unlikely position of fighting to save his life.",

Many of the world's most beloved stars shine in this love story to journalists, including Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Jeffrey Wright, Frances McDormand, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Stephen Park, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Lyna Khoudri, Mathieu Amalric, Christoph Waltz, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, Henry Winkler, Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray. Following the death of Arthur Howitzer, editor of The French Dispatch, Howitzer's staff convenes to write his obituary, leading to the creation of four stories: One, inspired by writer Herbsaint Sazerac (Wilson), is an unsettling travelogue of the seediest sections of the city. J.K.L. Berensen (Swinton) offers \"The Concrete Masterpiece\" about Moses Rosenthaler (Del Toro), a criminally insane painter, and his prison guard and muse (Seydoux). \"Revisions to a Manifesto\" by Lucinda Krementz (McDormand, whose character is an homage to The New Yorker's iconic writer Mavis Gallant), is a chronicle of love and death at the height of student revolt. And writer Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright) pens a suspenseful tale of drugs, kidnapping and fine dining, cop style, with \"The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner.\" THE FRENCH DISPATCH is filled with the intriguing, visually rewarding, complex, detailed and funny elements audiences have come to expect from writer-director Wes Anderson.",

                        "description": "Jodie Comer gives a stunning performance in this thought-provoking drama set against the brutality of 14th century France from visionary filmmaker Ridley Scott. Based on actual events, the film centers on the accusation by Marguerite de Carrouges (Comer) that she was brutally assaulted by Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver), her husband Jean de Carrouges's (Matt Damon) friend. In order to protect his pride and prove his wife's claim, de Carrouges requests to fight Le Gris to the death. Now, all three lives hang in the balance in this society that holds that the victor of this grisly duel will be determined by God. Moreover, if de Carrouges dies in this fight, Marguerite will be put to death. Also starring Ben Affleck as Le Gris' scheming ally, the Count d'Alen\u00e7on, this gripping, cinematic story is based on Eric Jager's book \"The Last Duel: A True Story of Crime, Scandal, and Trial by Combat in Medieval France.\" THE LAST DUEL is a riveting, suspenseful tale about a courageous woman willing to risk her life in the service of truth.",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

        "description": "By most accounts, America was founded in 1776 when the Founding Fathers wrote the Declaration of Independence. More recently, The New York Times Magazine launched an initiative known as the 1619 Project, aiming to redefine America\u2019s birth as being 1619, when the first slave ship arrived on American shores. Which is it: 1619 or 1776? Professor Leslie Harris outlined the 1619 Project\u2019s positions and shed light on misunderstandings about slavery in traditional teachings of American history. On the other side of this debate, Professor John McWhorter introduced the 1776 Unites campaign, which maintains 1776 as America\u2019s true founding date, upholding America\u2019s founding principles and challenging assertions that the nation is permanently scarred by its past sins. Moderated by The Atlantic\u2019s Conor Friedersdorf, this lively conversation explored if the legacy of slavery or the nation\u2019s Declaration of Independence is what truly defines America.\n\nLeslie Harris, Professor of History, Northwestern University\nJohn McWhorter, Associate Professor of English, Columbia University\nConor Friedersdorf, Staff Writer, The Atlantic (Moderator)",
