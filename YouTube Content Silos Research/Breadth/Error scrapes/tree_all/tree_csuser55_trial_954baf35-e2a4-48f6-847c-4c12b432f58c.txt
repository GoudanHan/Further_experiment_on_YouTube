            "description": "A channel named Modern Day Debate reached out to me based on my flat earth debunking to see if I would debate someone named Kent Hovind about Young Earth Creationism. Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?\n\nWatch the whole Astronomy/Astrophysics playlist: ",

There exists an obscure fad called the electric universe, which tends to attract exemplars of the Dunning-Kruger effect who think they understand physics better than Einstein. Literally.

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
