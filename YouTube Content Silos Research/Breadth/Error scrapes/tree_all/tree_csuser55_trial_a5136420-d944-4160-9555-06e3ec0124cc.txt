There's dimensions to watching the film that I can't convey fully in a condensed video, like how stop-start the plots are, how Henry gets sick and the movie basically stops what it was doing for twenty minutes waiting for him to die, and how watching the film is to go through a rolling process of trying to figure out what the film is trying to actually tell you. People who are familiar with Jurassic World should catch the similar ways that Book of Henry demonizes a woman for not behaving exactly and precisely as the mother figure that the filmmakers think she should be. Susan gets off light, though, since she isn't executed by dinosaur for the crime of texting.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nTwitter: ",

This means you can heal yourself with your mind, you can manifest your desires, and you can commune with the universe to achieve ultimate transcendence! At least that's what some would have you believe. In actuality, physics says nothing of the sort. This is all just a ridiculous narrative spewed by con men that has come to be known as quantum mysticism. Together let's identify its origin, with figures like Deepak Chopra, and trace its development over the past few decades, culminating in YouTube channels like Spirit Science and Actualized.org, which go beyond mere pseudoscience and act as literal cults. Cults are bad, don't you agree? Let's expose and disarm them together.\n\nThanks to Chester Ho for help researching Actualized.org, check out his channel: ",

During the extremely needed bath, which she hates, I lost control of her head and she managed to latch onto my arm and break the skin with two teeth. It looked kinda rough, so I figured I should get a tetanus shot in the morning. By the time the clinic opened I was in some of the worst pain of my life, the swollen bite looked like a tennis ball was embedded inside my arm, and the selling was pressing constantly against my ulnar nerve. The pressure was so intense that I could feel gravity pulling on my skin and fingers. Anyway, that's a big part of why this is late.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: ",

During the extremely needed bath, which she hates, I lost control of her head and she managed to latch onto my arm and break the skin with two teeth. It looked kinda rough, so I figured I should get a tetanus shot in the morning. By the time the clinic opened I was in some of the worst pain of my life, the swollen bite looked like a tennis ball was embedded inside my arm, and the selling was pressing constantly against my ulnar nerve. The pressure was so intense that I could feel gravity pulling on my skin and fingers. Anyway, that's a big part of why this is late.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: ",
