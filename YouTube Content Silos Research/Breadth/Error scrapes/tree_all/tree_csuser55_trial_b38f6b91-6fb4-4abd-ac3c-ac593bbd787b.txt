I want to say I'm done with Fifty Shades forever, but given the legacy it's leaving behind, the upcoming slate of fanfiction-turned-novel-turned-movies, I'm sure we'll be back sometime. There's always more that I can say. I just can't stop talking about it.\n\nAlso Charlie Tango, Eurocopter EC135, is played in the film by a Eurocopter EC130 because Seattle noise laws prohibit civilian use of a helicopter as large as the EC135 within city limits. I do not know how this impacts Charlie Tango's safety rating.\n\nAna: Crystal Rhoney\nChristian: Mike Rugnetta\nTaylor: Mikey Neumann\nKate: Lindsay Ellis\nDr. Flynn: H.

Of Course It Does.\n\nI can\u2019t prove it, but I\u2019m pretty sure that I can identify the exact scene where Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson started drinking to get through the nudity and sex, and it\u2019s the shower scene where they\u2019re on the boat. The reason I pinpoint this one is because we have so many examples of Johnson doing an admirable job at acting while crying, but in that scene she\u2019s suddenly delivering her lines like she just got home from the dentist.\n\nWritten and produced by Dan Olson\n\nDrip: ",

The predictable outcome is that Classic rolls into Burning Crusade and Wrath with essentially the chaos of legacy servers that we see in EverQuest and many of the other surviving MMOs, but there's the tantalizing, though slim, possibility of an alternate development path, where Classic becomes a second attempt at history, basically WoW 2, but starting from where things were 13 years ago. I wouldn't even entirely mind if some of the hazier, less balanced sensibilities of Classic cropped back up in the future, if the pace of the game slowed a bit without necessarily just making things bad and inconvenient to get there.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: ",

Of Course It Does.\n\nI can\u2019t prove it, but I\u2019m pretty sure that I can identify the exact scene where Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson started drinking to get through the nudity and sex, and it\u2019s the shower scene where they\u2019re on the boat. The reason I pinpoint this one is because we have so many examples of Johnson doing an admirable job at acting while crying, but in that scene she\u2019s suddenly delivering her lines like she just got home from the dentist.\n\nWritten and produced by Dan Olson\n\nDrip: ",

The predictable outcome is that Classic rolls into Burning Crusade and Wrath with essentially the chaos of legacy servers that we see in EverQuest and many of the other surviving MMOs, but there's the tantalizing, though slim, possibility of an alternate development path, where Classic becomes a second attempt at history, basically WoW 2, but starting from where things were 13 years ago. I wouldn't even entirely mind if some of the hazier, less balanced sensibilities of Classic cropped back up in the future, if the pace of the game slowed a bit without necessarily just making things bad and inconvenient to get there.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: ",

This was originally supposed to be ready for the release of Fifty Shades Freed back in February, but that clearly didn't happen. I know I like to try and write little mini-essays down here in the description, but I'm hard pressed to think of something to put here that isn't already in this video. It's over an hour long.\n\nTwitter: ",
