This is what a typical day working in Japan is like if you work in the Casino Entertainment and leisure Industry.  This is typical life living in Tokyo and working a morning shift.  The Japan working culture is shown as we follow Kento, 27 year old Pachinko Parlor Hall Manager from morning until evening to see what his average Japanese job is like.  Pachinko Hall manager works at Maruhan, one of the largest Pachinko companies in Japan. Pachinko is a type of mechanical ball game resembling pinball, but instead with many tiny balls and with the aim to drop the balls into specific pockets in the machine.  If one of the balls, goes into the designated pocket, called STATO CHAKKA, it will initiate a slot machine like roll on the LCD screen.  If the numbers or patterns line up, then it\u2019s a jackpot.  The winnings can be used to claim various prizes at the front desk, but cannot be claimed for cash directly since gambling is prohibited by Japanese law.  Instead, the winnings can be exchanged into gold chips.  Then outside at a neighboring TUC shop, the gold chips can be exchanged for cash. \n\nNOTE: I hope that everyone is staying safe and healthy during these times.  This video was filmed before Tokyo started recommending a city lockdown.  In fact, at the time of uploading this video, Tokyo is still not officially on lockdown and residents are able to go out as they wish, but please know that I am staying at home these days as much as possible, eating meals at home and only venturing out for necessary items such as pregnancy clinic visits, grocery shopping, etc and also practicing social distancing as much as it is possible in Tokyo.  And of course, I am not traveling these days.  \n\n\u3053\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u306f\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u5bfe\u7b56\uff1a\u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u5916\u51fa\u81ea\u7c9b\u8981\u8acb\u304c\u51fa\u308b\u524d\u306b\u64ae\u5f71\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\nWatch more Japan Day in the Life Series (Playlist):\n- ",

This is what a typical day working in Japan is like at a Toy company as a Japanese worker.  We see Japanese work culture throughout the day and see how it is to work in japan as well how it is to live in Japan during this time before work and after work. Kana works at Sega Toys, creating some of the most popular toys in Japan, formed in 1998 from its parent company Sega, one of the largest video game and entertainment companies in the world.  Although many of the Sega Sammy companies are located in the same building, Sega Toys operate independently with 110 hard working staff to create award winning toys even with major brands like anpanman and disney. Kana is originally from Aichi prefecture but moved to Yamanashi prefecture to attend university majoring in Regional Sociology.  Like many Japanese university students, she started her shushoku katsdo, aka Job Hunting while in school and was able to secure employment before graduation which led her to Tokyo to start a new life and career.  And as a person who has a deep appreciation for all things cute and fun, she naturally found a fit at her job for the last 4 years as a Toy Planner creating Japanese toys.\n\nSega Toys\n- ",

Living in Japan and working in Japan is quite a unique experience.  This is a day in the life of Japanese worker, Makoto, 27 years old who lives in a Tokyo 3-story house with his family.  This Tokyo salaryman works in a small Tokyo office, but spends many of his Japan working hours traveling from client to client on the Tokyo trains.  Makoto works for a company called Mobal and as many Japanese salarymen, he entered the company straight from a Japanese University and he plans to spend his entire salaryman career at the same company.  That is the life in Japan for a salaryman.  We take a look inside what it's like to work in a small Tokyo office as well as to visit clients throughout Tokyo city area.  His job experiences maybe unique to his company, but fundamentally he is very much an average salaryman.  He commutes by train everyday to get to work and has to ride his mama-chari bike to get to the train station from his home.   This Tokyo salaryman life has him arriving to work early and working late.  As a salaryman, Makoto receives a standard salary every month for all the long work hours.  The Japanese office is also configured so his boss' desk is right in front of him, quite a Japanese style office working environment.  This very average Japanese work day and work lifestyle showcases a true day in Japan work life.    \n\nMobal\n- ",

Japanese workers are often portrayed as Salarymen but in this video we focus on Japanese food services industry and what it is like to work in a Japanese restaurant.  This is a day in the life of a Japanese Chef, Tetsuya, 41 years old, working in Japan at a ramen store, karashibi miso ramen Kinkanbo.  It's a popular spicy ramen shop in Tokyo Japan serving a devil ramen.  We see Japanese working hours as well as Japanese workers in a Tokyo ramen restaurant, a peek into Japanese life.  Tetsuya starts the day in his apartment and as an average Japanese worker, he commutes to work in Tokyo via train.  It only takes him 20 minutes to get to work, but soon after arriving, he's busy working at the Japanese food restaurant and preparing Japanese ramen noodles for customers.  His main duty is the manager of the ramen shop, but he also creates new gentei limited time menu items as a Japanese ramen chef.  Life in Tokyo is amazing and part of this is because we have dedicated workers in Japan that keep the city running.  To be a Japanese chef you must really have a passion for what  you do.  If you are ever looking for a spicy food challenge or spicy ramen challenge in Tokyo, then the Kikanbo ramen shop should be you first destination.  But don't worry, if you can't eat spicy ramen, the ramen shop also prepares non-spicy version of the ramen bowl.  Customers can choose their level of spiciness from low all the way to Oni level, aka Devil ramen. Enjoy this Japanese food tour of a Japanese ramen shop.\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- ",

Teru, 44 years old, runs a local Japanese meat butcher shop in Tokyo, Yanagiya, which has been in his family for 73 years.  It\u2019s named after his family, Yanagi. Yanagiya only sells A5 Sendai Gyu Beef, which is famous for having a strict grading criteria for it\u2019s meat, as only 30 % of the cows in Miyagi prefecture are good enough to be certified with premium A5 medal. All Japanese beef is considered wagyu beef, but not all Wagyu beef is A5 grade.  A5 wagyu beef is the highest quality of meat you can get in Japan based on it\u2019s beef grading system.  Basically, you have Yield Grade and a Quality Grade, hence A AND 5.  The Yield Grade, is the  amount of meat you can get from the cow, and is graded either A, B or C, A being the highest mark.  While the Quality grade, depends on 4 categories, marbling, color & brightness, firmness and texture, and finally color, luster and quality of fat.  Each is graded from 1 being poor all the way to 5 excellent.  In order to achieve an overall 5 grade, the meat must receive a 5 in every category.  So Receiving all 5\u2019s but 1 4 in a category, won\u2019t cut and it\u2019d result in an overall grade of 4.  If you look closely at the Wagyu beef, you can see what the Japanese call Sashi, or in English the marbling or thin stips of fat in the beef. Without this excellent marbling, the meat wouldn\u2019t be considered grade 5 quality.\n\nWatch more Japan Day in the Life Series (Playlist):\n- ",

This is what a typical day working in Japan is like at a Toy company as a Japanese worker.  We see Japanese work culture throughout the day and see how it is to work in japan as well how it is to live in Japan during this time before work and after work. Kana works at Sega Toys, creating some of the most popular toys in Japan, formed in 1998 from its parent company Sega, one of the largest video game and entertainment companies in the world.  Although many of the Sega Sammy companies are located in the same building, Sega Toys operate independently with 110 hard working staff to create award winning toys even with major brands like anpanman and disney. Kana is originally from Aichi prefecture but moved to Yamanashi prefecture to attend university majoring in Regional Sociology.  Like many Japanese university students, she started her shushoku katsdo, aka Job Hunting while in school and was able to secure employment before graduation which led her to Tokyo to start a new life and career.  And as a person who has a deep appreciation for all things cute and fun, she naturally found a fit at her job for the last 4 years as a Toy Planner creating Japanese toys.\n\nSega Toys\n- ",

This  Japanese Butcher living in Tokyo Japan offers premium A5 Japanese wagyu beef, Japanese pork, Japanese chicken and various curated meats.  This is an average day living in Tokyo as well as average day working in tokyo as a meat butcher.  You'll get a glimpse into Japan work culture for this field.  Teru, 44 years old, runs a local Japanese meat butcher shop in Tokyo, Yanagiya, which has been in his family for 73 years.  It\u2019s named after his family, Yanagi. Yanagiya only sells A5 Sendai Gyu Beef, which is famous for having a strict grading criteria for it\u2019s meat, as only 30 % of the cows in Miyagi prefecture are good enough to be certified with premium A5 medal.

So Receiving all 5\u2019s but 1 4 in a category, won\u2019t cut and it\u2019d result in an overall grade of 4.  If you look closely at the Wagyu beef, you can see what the Japanese call Sashi, or in English the marbling or thin stips of fat in the beef. Without this excellent marbling, the meat wouldn\u2019t be considered grade 5 quality.\n\nWatch more Japan Day in the Life Series (Playlist):\n- ",

Dom is a legend, and even when great pizzaiolos visit him, like Frank and Mark, they can end up questioning their own pies.\n\nWATCH NEXT:\nChef's Night Out with Paulie Gee's: ",
