                    "description": "On May 11th 2017, Boyan Slat, Founder and CEO of The Ocean Cleanup, the Dutch foundation developing advanced technologies to rid the oceans of plastic, announced a design breakthrough allowing for the cleanup of half the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in just 5 years.\n\nThe main idea behind The Ocean Cleanup is to let the ocean currents do the work. An installation of U-shaped screens channels floating plastic to a central point. The concentrated plastic can then be extracted and shipped to shore for recycling into durable products. The improvements involve the introduction of a mobile, or drifting system. Rather than fixing the floating screens to the seabed at great depths, The Ocean Cleanup will apply sea anchors to ensure the floating screens move slower than the plastic. Rather than one massive barrier, the improved, modular cleanup system consists of a fleet of screens.\n\nMore information:",

It's sent to waste-to-energy facilities and landfills as far away as Ohio and South Carolina. It takes a vast network of sanitation workers, trucks, trains, cranes, and barges \u2014 and $429 million a year \u2014 to get it there.\n\nMORE BIG BUSINESS VIDEOS:\nHow 800 Million Pounds of Himalayan Salt Are Mined Each Year | Big Business",

The microchip launched a technological revolution, created Silicon Valley, and everyone\u2019s got one in their pocket (read: smartphones). \n\nWhen you zoom in on one of these chips, you find a highly complex, nanoscale-sized city that\u2019s expertly designed to send information back and forth.\n\nAnd chip manufacturers continue to shrink the size of microchips, hitting smaller and smaller milestones while also increasing the number of features a chip has. The result is an improved overall processing power. \n\nThis is what\u2019s been driving the semiconductor industry\u2014a drumbeat called Moore\u2019s Law. \n\nMoore's Law is the golden rule in computing: The number of transistors on a microchip can be expected to double every two years, while the cost of computers is cut in half. This basically means we'll have more speed, at less cost, over time. And so, we've been shrinking transistors (the tiny electric switches that process data for everything from clocks to AI algorithms) down to really, really tiny nanoscales.\n\nAnd though we've hit a physical limit on how small these transistors can get, Intel (and a couple other competitors, like Samsung and TSMC) are betting big on something new: EUV Lithography.\n\nFind out more about this next generation of chip technology that is taking Moore\u2019s Law to a new level on this episode of Focal Point.

The breach wave quickly overwhelmed the downstream Sanford Dam, overtopping and failing the structure. Over 10,000 residents in Sanford, Midland, and Saginaw were evacuated. The independent forensic team charged with investigating the event released an interim report in September 2021. The conclusions of the report include a discussion of a relatively rare phenomenon in earthen dams. Let\u2019s walk through the investigation to try and understand what happened.\n\nIFT Interim Report (PDF): ",

It was recorded at Atlantic Studios (Recorded on October 24 & 26, 1960) during the sessions for My Favorite Things.\n\n***Coltrane\u2019s wife Naima named the song \"Equinox\". The equinox occurs twice a year when the tilt of the Earth\u2019s axis is inclined neither away from nor towards the sun. John Coltrane was born on September 23, 1926, the day of the official autumn equinox of that year.\n\nThe release of \"Equinox\" was delayed until 1964 when Atlantic issued the album Coltrane\u2019s Sound. Before he recorded it, Coltrane performed \"Equinox\" several times in live venues, including a session with Miles Davis\u2019 rhythm section and at the 1960 Monterey Jazz Festival. Unfortunately, the other Atlantic recordings of \"Equinox\" were lost in the 1978 warehouse fire before they were released.",

Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?\n\nThis documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI\u2019s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI\u2019s social implications?\n\nA documentary by Tilman Wolff und Ranga Yogeshwar \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Shenzhen has transformed itself from a tiny fishing village to a megacity in just 50 years, its population tripling since the 1990s. The city is a magnet for tech-savvy and inventive dreamers from all across China and the world, because of them Shenzhen has become the \u201csilicon valley\u201d of China, a true technology and innovation hub.\n\nThe sprawling metropolis is famed for its skyscrapers, hybrid cars, solar energy and for being home to a great many hi-tech companies. UBTECH is one of them; its focus is on making robots an indispensable part of everyday life. Its key product is the android \u2013 a human-like robot that can help out in the workplace and around the home as well as becoming both teacher and playmate for kids. \n\nShenzhen municipal government encourages citizens to switch to eco-friendly, hybrid cars that use both fuel and solar energy. The vehicles are made by a local manufacturer, BYD. Public transport here is hybrid too helping maintain the city\u2019s ecological reputation, which is among the best in China. The city\u2019s rapid growth demands new solutions for optimising space. Shenzhen is one of the top 10 cities in the world for having the most skyscrapers. Today, its engineers are working on a solution to the ever present problem of parking by developing smart car parks that can automatically place cars in tight spaces while the driver simply walks away. \n\nThe technological achievements of the city's many companies are regularly showcased at popular international exhibitions and forums.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO RTD Channel to get documentaries firsthand!
