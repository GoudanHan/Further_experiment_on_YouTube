                "description": "In his new essay for the New York-based Foreign Affairs magazine,  Mearsheimer argues that the US and China are locked in a dangerous security competition, more perilous than the first Cold War. In essence, once China grew wealthy, a US-China cold war was inevitable. Had US policymakers understood this logic in the early 1990s, they would have tried to slow down Chinese growth and maximise the power gap between Beijing and Washington.\n\nHowever, the US did the opposite: it pursued a policy of engagement, which aimed to help China grow wealthier \u2013 based on the assumption that China would become a democracy and a responsible stakeholder, which would lead to a more peaceful world. Instead of fostering harmonious relations between China and the US, engagement led to an intense rivalry.\n\nIs Australia and the world in deep trouble? Absent a major internal Chinese crisis, Washington and Beijing are consigned to waging a dangerous security competition. Can we manage on the margins to prevent disaster?\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is professor of political science and international relations at the University of Chicago and author of The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001). He was a guest at the Centre for Independent Studies in 2019. \n\nHost: Tom Switzer is executive director of the Centre for Independent Studies. \n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nCIS promotes free choice and individual liberty and the open exchange of ideas.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",

He and I exchanged some words regarding racism, politics, and psychology, and hilarity ensued. As a disclaimer, there is no educational merit to this exchange whatsoever. This is 90 minutes of Jesse saying the dumbest things imaginable, and me mocking him relentlessly in response. Only watch this if that sounds entertaining to you.\n\nNote: I turned off comments because I got tired of spending 1-2 hours a day explaining basic logic to ignorant bigots. If you were planning to drop a comment on another video, or message me on some other platform, please first read the following:\n1) Out of wedlock does not mean single. You don't have be married to raise children together, and in fact, black couples disproportionately don't marry. Out of wedlock does not equal single parent. Read that sentence as  many times as you need to in order to get it into your skull. Jesse misrepresented the statistic, and then piled other claims on top regarding crime and drug use with no basis. He was wrong. Let me repeat. He was wrong.\n2) Jesse's ancestors were indeed slaves. He was lying. He is a liar. Google it.\n3) The history of slavery is irrelevant, so stop acting like you're a history scholar. It doesn't matter if there were times that slavery wasn't racist. When one race enslaves another race, it's racist.\n4) If you were planning on saying nothing but spewing Jesse's catch phrases, congratulations, you are among the dumbest people alive.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates/discussions: ",

This follows-up previous benchmarks and reviews of Alienware, Dell, Lenovo, ABS, and Skytech, among others. The HP Pavilion tested was recommended to us by HP's support -- who told us we should get 32GB of RAM for gaming, for some reason, while also recommending an Intel i5 CPU and a 2060 Super. It's a bizarre combination of things that led to this build. We're still on our quest to find the best pre-built gaming PCs. So far, we've found two pretty good ones and a bunch that aren't that.\n\nPre-built gaming PC review playlist: ",

The endless blue stretches away in all directions, while the black abyss hangs gaping below. Currents are stronger here. There is no shelter to be found, and food is hard to come by. But all the same, a plethora of life has found ways to survive here, from the surface, all the way down into the abyss, utilising some unexpected adaptations to overcome the challenges of life in the open ocean. \n\nWe\u2019ll begin our investigation at the surface of the high seas. Of all the zones of the open ocean, here is the most abundant. Whales glide through the waves, pods of dolphins ride the powerful currents, and all manner of pelagic creatures can be found feeding at the surface. The secret to its diversity is sunlight, for here is the photic zone, also called the epipelagic or sunlight zone. Light from above is able to penetrate down to a depth of 200 metres, and within this uppermost layer, phytoplankton is able to undergo photosynthesis to provide food for the life here in the upper water column.\n\nPart 1 | Demersal Deep Sea Life: ",

One organised specifically to gather data on the ocean environment and its inhabitants. During its 127,580 km (79,280 mi) journey circumnavigating the globe, the crew on board the Challenger took 492 deep sea soundings, and 284 dredges and trawls. This led to the discovery of 4,700 new species of marine life, recorded in volumes and illustrated by the official expedition artist, John James Wild.",
