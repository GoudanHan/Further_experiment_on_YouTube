I would encourage everybody to experience this game for yourself instead of watching but for those that can't here's a playthrough. \n\nThe Beginner's Guide is a narrative video game from Davey Wreden, the creator of The Stanley Parable. It lasts about an hour and a half and has no traditional mechanics, no goals or objectives. Instead, it tells the story of a person struggling to deal with something they do not understand.\n\nSubscribe ",

                    "description": "Bioshock Infinite is a game that recently came out and I played it.\n\nNothing I say here is all that original - most of what I had to say about the game was structural and design stuff, not lit crit stuff.  I may or may not do a video on that part of the game in the distant future, but for now I'm sort of Bioshock Infinite-d out.\n\nIt's certainly an odd duck - a game that (when it's hitting the right buttons) is impossible not to love, and there are moments and characters here that are simply inspired.  After I finished the game I couldn't stop thinking about it for days, and not just because of the ending - it was a game that had left some sort of emotional imprint on me.  \n\nAnd yet I had to force myself to keep playing in parts; to remind myself that there was a reason I wanted to finish a given combat section to see what good stuff waited on the other side.  And as I began a second playthrough that curiosity had diminished and I was left with an seething loathing for the bits that prevented me from getting to the parts I cared about.  At that point I realized that Bioshock Infinite is a charming two to three hour exploration adventure game padded out to seven to ten hours with some absolutely insufferable shooting mechanics that betray everything the *Shock series has ever been known for or good at.  To be clear: It's not a \"You changed it from what it used to be!\" thing.  It's more of a \"You took a series of interesting systems and turned them into a stock shooter - worse, a *terrible* stock shooter.  Feel bad about yourselves.\"",

Sorry if this video ended up way long, I just wanted to hear this game's explanation of what the Secret of Monkey island is and what Big Whoop is. After I finish this game's walkthroughs I will go back to MI2 and hopefully some of what was said in this video will make more sense to you first timers.",

Historically criminals have been defined as a group who are seen as \"other\" to non-criminals. However, modern thinking has moved away from this with developments in the psychology of criminal rule-breaking and discussions of how individual psychology can assist the understanding of criminal rule-breaking and risk; including approaches to rehabilitation and behavioural change. Professor Adshead suggests that these different discourses have much to offer one another.\n\nThe transcript and downloadable versions of the lecture are available from the Gresham College website: ",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",
