That's right, it's everyone's favorite namesake of a YA protagonist, Perseus! Known for precisely one adventure, Perseus also carries the distinction of being the only Greek hero without an obnoxious character flaw - none of Hercules's rages, Jason or Theseus's wifely abandonment, or Orpheus's complete inability to keep his sh*t together for five consecutive minutes.\n\nNote: Apparently Andromeda was actually ethiopian. I didn't know this when I was drawing her, so\u2026 my bad D:\n\nHey, here's a fun fact - I actually quite liked the Percy Jackson books. I thought they were a little corny at times, but I'll be damned if Riordan doesn't write a compelling first-person narrative. However, I can't bring myself to enjoy the Roman series. Something about it just feels like a pale imitation of the Percy Jackson series's former glory.\n\nCheck out the full ending song HERE! ",

Did Lovecraft write some pretty incredible horror? Sure! Was he also a raging xenophobe? Absolutely! Are his perspectives on life connected with the stories he felt compelled to tell? Duh! If you look at Lovecraft's writing through the lens of his life, clear patterns emerge that allow us to pin down what exactly he built his horror cosmology out of. It's an invaluable analytical tool that allows us to take apart his writings by getting inside his head. So before you yell at me for Not Separating The Artist From The Art, know that it was completely intentional and I'm not sorry.",

        "description": "It's the mother of all dystopias! Long before YA dystopia rose to power, before the age of Young Attractive Heroes who Rebel Against The State and Also Find Love, there was just Winston Smith - a middle-aged man in poor health who Rebelled Against The State and Also Found Love. It just ended much less prettily for him.\n\n1984 codified most of the modern dystopia tropes - absolute control of the media, black-bagging people who spoke out, and a lot of popular terms like \"doublethink\", \"big brother\", and \"thought police\". Unfortunately, a lot of those terms got stripped of context and thrown around for the sake of Extra Edge, and as a result they get used a little haphazardly. And there's nothing Red hates more than misused terminology, so here's the video outlining the ORIGINAL meaning of 1984!\n\nPATREON: www.patreon.com/user?u=4664797\n\nMERCH LINKS:\nShirts - ",

This difficult challenge of completing six Mario games back to back in under an hour has long been part of speedrunning community lore, but where did it come from? Who has completed it? And where does the record stand today? \n\nAfter 9 months, I am so happy to finally share this video with you guys! Huge thanks to you for watching this video and my community for supporting me along the way. You guys are amazing and I just want to say thank you! :D\n\nWatch the Marihour grind live! ",

In this video, I cover the world record progression of the any% speedrunning category in Majora's Mask from its release to the present day. \n\nThis is my first ever scripted video, so I'm hoping it's acceptable! I started working on this in early 2018, but I procrastinated until now. It turns out that was the right decision, though, since a lot happened in this game in the past year.\n\nI plan on making many more videos like this that go more in-depth on lots of Majora's Mask topics, from how glitches work, to thought experiments (hOW maNy RUpeeS Do YOu NeeD to beAT tHe GAMe), as well as other stuff I probably haven't thought of yet. Let me know if you have any ideas for things you want me to cover!\n\nCorrections:\n-Gigopler's name should have been capitalized in the credits (sorry, Gigo, not rerendering the whole thing for that)\n\n-I implied that sva had the record in January 2014 for \"12 hours,\" but I don't actually know how long it was. Not sure why I said 12 hours. Definitely less than a day, but also definitely longer than Trev had the record in 2017, so 12 hours is probably a decent guess.\n\n-The info at ",
