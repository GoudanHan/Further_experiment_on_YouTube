        "description": "Why do so many stories about racism revolve around the White Savior? In 2020, as the Movement for Black Lives grew in the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others, The Help experienced a resurgence in popularity, becoming one of the most-streamed movies on Netflix. The 2011 film about a white woman confronting racism may be well-intentioned, but\u2014like Green Book, The Blind Side, and other White Savior movies before it\u2014The Help centers its story on benevolent white characters, rather than on firsthand black perspectives. How did this trope become so persistent? Here\u2019s our Take on the dangers of the White Savior, and how we can change our own narratives and conversations to become more anti-racist ourselves.

Generally, they don't show their faces, but sometimes abusers' hands are visible. And, as it turns out, vein patterns in people's hands and forearms are pretty unique.\n\nThrough a project called H-Unique, Sue and her team at Lancaster University are asking the public to send photos of their hands. With the public's help, they want to enable AI to catch child sex abusers across the world in a fraction of the time it takes right now.\n\nIn the fight against some of the world\u2019s most horrendous crimes Sue explains that although DNA has often been the gold standard, hands may hold the key to catching sex abusers.\n\nIn our series Super Users, VICE World News explores the latest technology being used to fight crime, trafficking, climate change and social injustice. \n\nTo make a H-unique contribution, visit their website here: ",

This video was recorded at The Australian National University on 10 April 2012.\n\nRichard Dawkins FRS is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford. Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.\n\nHe is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.\n\nRichard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He has been awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the Nakayama Prize, the Cosmos International Prize, the Kistler Prize, the Shakespeare Prize and the Lewis Thomas Prize.\n\nLawrence M. Krauss is a renowned cosmologist and science populariser, and is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is also the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and nine books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and his most recent bestseller entitled A Universe from Nothing.\n\nHe received his PhD from MIT in 1982 and then joined the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and was a professor at Yale University and Chair of the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University before taking his present position. Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist and Scientific American and appears regularly on radio and television. He is one of the few scientists to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, and is also active in issues of science and society. He serves as co-chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and on the Board of Directors of the Federation of American Scientists.",

Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss. Hosted in the St. Regis Hotel Ballroom, Aspen, Colorado.",

This is part 2 of that conversation. \n\nWithin the LGBTQ umbrella lies a multitude of identities and ideologies. In an effort to showcase this VICE gathers a diverse group of progressive and conservative members of the LGBTQ community to discuss topics that relate to queerness and its intersection with culture, and politics. \n\nOur goal is to foster conversations that are already happening within communities. With this format, we hope to give the viewer a rare opportunity to witness a conversation with people across the aisle that they otherwise might never find themselves in.\n\nTIMECODES OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED:",
