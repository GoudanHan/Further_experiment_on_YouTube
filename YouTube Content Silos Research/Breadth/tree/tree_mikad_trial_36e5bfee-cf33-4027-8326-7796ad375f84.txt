Only a handful, 16 percent approve of his handling of the trucker protest.\n\nThis morning, some truckers are reportedly bending to the pressure and leaving the Ottawa protest: They can\u2019t afford to have their bank accounts frozen and insurance canceled. \n...\nSubscribe to Fox Business!

He identifies the varieties, the reasons, and the potential costs and benefits, arguing that leaders often lie for good strategic reasons, while distinguishing between lying to another state and lying to one's own people.\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is also the co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago and has written extensively about security issues and international politics.\n\nThe World Beyond the Headlines is a project of the Center for International Studies, which brings scholars, journalists, and world leaders to the University to discuss issues of current global importance. \n\nFor more information on this event, visit ",

A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

And, can we go bigger? You bet we can go bigger. In this video, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are here to help you understand how big some numbers truly are.  \n\nWe have to start small. Neil takes us from a simple million to a billion and then way beyond anything you\u2019re imagining. You\u2019ll learn how many stars are in our galaxy. And, how many galaxies are in our universe. What does the number really mean in the scale of everything? \n\nHow long would it take you to count to a billion? How long would it take you to count to a trillion? Then, we cross the point where numbers get so big that you have to start using words to describe them. Discover more about a mole, a googol, a googolplex, and Skewes\u2019 number. After this video, you\u2019ll look at numbers a whole different way!\n\nSupport us on Patreon: ",

We explore the ever-advancing computer power and how that impacts the simulation hypothesis. Chuck wonders if a simulation universe has anything to do with us not being able to travel at the speed of light. You'll learn about Bayesian statistics. Lastly, Neil tells us how he was ready to embrace the simulation hypothesis until he came across a certain idea that changed his mind.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: ",

On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice break down space and time and other cosmic things you thought you knew.\n\nFind out about Einstein's special theory of relativity and our four dimensions. Neil and Chuck make lunch plans as they navigate space and time. What critiques does Neil have of The Terminator and Back to the Future? What are some unintended complications of time travel? Discover the concept of worldlines, getting unstuck from time in Slaughterhouse 5, and how time travel is just a changing of dimensions. \n\nNext, Chuck carefully avoids making any moon jokes as we break down myths about the moon. Why does the moon look bigger on the horizon? Is it actually a trick of the eye? You\u2019ll learn an easy trick to undo this illusion. What\u2019s a honey moon? We break down different moons including the creepiest, and also Chuck\u2019s favorite: the blood moon. \n\nHow big is the sun? We wrap our heads around the scale of our universe and the role of the sun on our planet. If the sun were magically plucked from its spot, how long would it take for us to realize it? How do sunspots work? What about solar flares? We break down the mechanics of the sun\u2019s interior, the merry-go-round effect, and the flipping of the sun's poles. All that, plus, what are fishes\u2019 experiences with the sun? \n\nThanks to our Patrons Ian Konkle, Panda Man, Manuel zamarripa jr, Priscilla & Kyle, It\u2019s all e=mc2 no vectors, Jesse Bunch, Dog Thereisno, Francisco Cunningham, and Steven Severin for supporting us this week.\n\nNOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can watch or listen to this entire episode commercial-free.\n\nAbout the prints that flank Neil in this video:\n\"Black Swan\u201d & \"White Swan\" limited edition serigraph prints by Coast Salish artist Jane Kwatleematt Marston.

We explore the ever-advancing computer power and how that impacts the simulation hypothesis. Chuck wonders if a simulation universe has anything to do with us not being able to travel at the speed of light. You'll learn about Bayesian statistics. Lastly, Neil tells us how he was ready to embrace the simulation hypothesis until he came across a certain idea that changed his mind.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: ",

                    "description": "The multiverse hypothesis or theory holds that a group of multiple universes (possibly infinite universes) comprise everything that exists: The entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them. The renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explains in detail the multiverse hypothesis. \n\nHowever, prominent physicists are divided about whether any other universes exist outside of our own. Some even go as far as to say that the multiverse is not a legitimate topic of scientific inquiry. Because it can not be empirically falsified. But Neil deGrasse Tyson among other prominent cosmologists, thinks that given our understanding of quantum mechanics and the theory of General relativity, the possibility of the existence of the multiverse is a legitimate scientific hypothesis. \n\nSteven Weinberg said that if the multiverse existed, the hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our Big Bang is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we live.\n\nSome scientists analyzed the data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, an uncrewed spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 that measured temperature differences across the sky in the cosmic microwave background, the radiant heat remaining from the Big Bang, and claimed they found evidence suggesting that our universe collided with other parallel universes in the distant past.\n\nHowever, a more thorough data analysis from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and from the Planck Satellite, a space observatory operated by the European Space Agency from 2009 to 2013, which mapped the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, did not find any statistically significant evidence of universe collisions. there was no evidence of any gravitational pull of other universes on ours either. And to add insult to injury to the proponents that the multiverse hypothesis has been backed up by statistical evidence, the Planck satellite, has a resolution three times higher than the WMA Probe.\n\n\nOur brains are not evolutionarily equipped to intuitively understand quantum mechanics and large scale cosmic phenomena. But Neil deGrasse Tyson with his usual wits explains the multiverse hypothesis in layman's terms. ",
