He didn't like it much, so he decided to make a 14-part series about how dumb I am. He really pulled out all the stops, parading all of his classic fallacious talking points, with plenty of bald-faced lies and deliberate misrepresentations of scientific research peppered in for good measure. Honestly, I was rather shocked at how stupid it was. With so much material to work with, I ended up with quite a lot to say in response, and had to split it into two parts.\n\nIn this Part 2, we examine how James is lying about our progress towards prebiotic syntheses of all the major classes of biomolecules, and when it comes to cells, James would rather mislead his viewers with dazzling animations of modern eukaryotic cells than actually dig into the relevant literature. If you thought Part 1 was devastating, strap in.\n\nPart 1 of this response: ",

Pierre-Marie Robitaille is a former radiologist who likes to pretend that he understands astrophysics better than astrophysicists. He doesn't. When he talks, he makes ridiculous claims and blatant errors that can be spotted by anyone with a basic understanding of physics and astronomy. Nevertheless, many gullible people speak about him like he's a genius, so I thought I'd explain quite thoroughly how he definitely isn't.

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

This means you can heal yourself with your mind, you can manifest your desires, and you can commune with the universe to achieve ultimate transcendence! At least that's what some would have you believe. In actuality, physics says nothing of the sort. This is all just a ridiculous narrative spewed by con men that has come to be known as quantum mysticism. Together let's identify its origin, with figures like Deepak Chopra, and trace its development over the past few decades, culminating in YouTube channels like Spirit Science and Actualized.org, which go beyond mere pseudoscience and act as literal cults. Cults are bad, don't you agree? Let's expose and disarm them together.\n\nThanks to Chester Ho for help researching Actualized.org, check out his channel: ",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

That\u2019s the reported price Prince Andrew will pay Virginia Guiffre to settle a very disturbing legal case against him. She says when she was 17 she was trafficked to the Prince by the paedophile businessman Jeffrey Epstein, ably assisted by his sex-offender partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Despite that photo, Andrew denies ever meeting, let alone having sex with Ms Guiffre, but he\u2019s been so discredited, these days it\u2019s difficult to believe anything the disgraced royal says.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

If he's right, he'll provide desperately needed answers for the families of the 239 passengers and crew who were aboard the Boeing triple-seven when it vanished eight years ago.

                    "description": "David Graeber, author of Debt: The First 5,000 Years, in conversation with Jonathan Conning, Associate Professor of Economics at Hunter College at the Graduate Center, CUNY.\n\nAbout the book:\n\nEvery economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter system-to relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. The problem with this version of history? There's not a shred of evidence to support it.Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that 5,000 years ago, during the beginning of the agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems. It is in this era, Graeber shows, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors.\n\nWith the passage of time, however, virtual credit money was replaced by gold and silver coins-and the system as a whole began to decline. Interest rates spiked and the indebted became slaves. And the system perpetuated itself with tremendously violent consequences, with only the rare intervention of kings and churches keeping the system from spiraling out of control. Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a fascinating chronicle of this little known history-as well as how it has defined human history, and what it means for the credit crisis of the present day and the future of our economy.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\nDavid Graeber is an anthropologist and activist based in New York, and London, where he holds the position of Reader in Social Anthropology at Goldsmiths, University of London. He is the author of six books, including Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value, Lost People: Magic and History in Central Madagascar, Direct Action: An Ethnography, and most recently, Debt: The First Five Thousand Years, alongside popular and political writings that have appeared in venues like Harpers, The Baffler, and The Nation. He is currently working on two books: one on bureaucracy, the other about his involvement in the formation of Occupy Wall Street.\n\nJonathan Conning joined the economics department in the fall of 2002. His research and teaching interests include Development Economics, applied microeconomic theory and financial contracting, as well as trade and modern political economy. His research has explored the structure and operation of rural financial markets, microfinance and social investment, as well as topics in agrarian production organization, property rights, economic history, and impact evaluation.",

                "description": "Republicans in Florida and Texas passed new laws targeting technology companies for banning or \"canceling\" certain speech -- an uphill battle, as a federal judge blocked the Texas law as unconstitutional. Renowned free speech lawyer Floyd Abrams agrees, saying the new GOP laws violate the First Amendment because media and tech companies have the legal right to decide what to publish. Abrams, the \"most sought-after First Amendment litigator of his generation,\" according to New York Times, speaks out on those laws, free speech in the digital age, reporter's privilege, his litigation against Rudy Giuliani and for Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump's \"danger,\" and a range of legal and political issues in this wide-ranging interview with Ari Melber, who used to practice law with Abrams. This is the newest installment of The Summit Series with Ari Melber, featuring discussions with leaders at the summit of their fields. The series debuted in 2021 with Melber\u2019s interview with Bill Gates. \n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: ",
