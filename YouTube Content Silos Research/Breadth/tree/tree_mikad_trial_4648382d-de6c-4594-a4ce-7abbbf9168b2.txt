Recently, the Indian government communicated its position on the situation, calling for a 'peaceful resolution' through 'sustained diplomatic efforts' for 'long-term peace and stability'.\n\nOn February 8, we hosted the first India and the World webinar of this new year with Rajan Menon, Andrew Weiss, Judy Dempsey, and Suhasini Haidar on the current situation in Ukraine. Moderated by Deep Pal, the session analyzed what the rising Ukraine-Russia tensions may mean for India and the world.",

As these major players now seek to up their stakes in the region, will ASEAN be compelled to choose sides or can it retain its official impartiality? What role does the organisation have in managing great power relations in the region? How do Five-University network partner institutions see their respective nations' engagement with ASEAN developing? Will ASEAN be up to the task or will its shortcomings be highlighted once again? \n\nThis session is part of the Five-University Research Collaboration on East Asia Security Cooperation, a sustained discussion concerning East Asian security cooperation and regional governance among scholars and students from five universities: Peking University, Princeton University, Korea University, National University of Singapore and the University of Tokyo. This research collaboration is the first US-East Asian inter-university research network of its kind.\n\n================================================\nDate: Friday, 13 December 2013 \nTime: ",

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

His lecture, \"Education: For Whom and For What?\" featured a talk on the state of higher education, followed by a question-and-answer session. \n\nChomsky, an Institute Professor and a Professor Emeritus of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he worked for more than 50 years, has been concerned with a range of education-related issues in recent years. Among them: How do we characterize the contemporary state of the American education system? What happens to the quality of education when public universities become more privatized? Are public universities in danger of being converted into facilities that produce graduates-as-commodities for the job market? What is the role of activism in education? With unprecedented tuition increases and budget struggles occurring across American campuses, these are questions that are more relevant than ever.",

                    "description": "The United States and China are in the trenches of a trade war, with damaging consequences for both sides. While China's economy is dependent on exports, with nearly 20 percent of its exports going to the US, industries in the United States reliant on imports are also feeling the pressure on their supply chains and may look to shift production outside the US in order to avoid higher production costs at home. The Trump administration is betting that China will back down and American companies will profit from protectionism.\n\nBigger economic challenges will emerge if the trade war continues. Faced with higher tariffs, China could struggle to find trading partners for exports it normally sends to the US. The negative effects of the trade war are also not limited to the US and China. South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are closely linked to China\u2019s economy, and businesses which are part of the supply chain to China are also feeling the pain of tariffs. The UK, for example, is already reporting losses, causing it to increase prices on automobiles sold in China. What may come of this trade war and what are its long-term effects? Are the tensions between the US and China really about trade and technological dominance, or is this a great power competition for economic and strategic supremacy?\n\nYukon Huang is currently a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, D.C. and was formerly the World Bank\u2019s Country Director for China. Mr. Huang will join us to discuss the implications of the trade war for both China and the United States in terms of economic growth and their broader relationship.\n\nSPEAKER:\nYukon Huang\nSenior Fellow, Asia Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\n\nMODERATOR:\nMarkos Kounalakis\nVisiting Fellow, Hoover Institution\n\nFor more information about this event please visit: ",

                    "description": "Public Lecture by Emeritus Professor Paul Dibb and Adjunct Associate Professor John Lee.\n\nThe belief that China will soon become the dominant power in Asia is based on assumptions that its continued and rapid economic rise, and its emergence as a regional peer of America\u2019s in military terms is all but assured. Such a belief underpins arguments that a fundamental strategic reorganisation of Asia is inevitable, and that it will be necessary and perhaps even desirable to concede to China significant \u2018strategic space\u2019. Dependent largely on linear extrapolations about the future, such arguments ignore the implications of China\u2019s economic, social and national fragilities, its lack of major friends or allies in the region as well as the considerable military deficiencies and challenges faced by the People\u2019s Liberation Army. With the Defence White Paper due for release in 2015, the government should bear in mind that planning for an era of Chinese dominance in the region\u2014or even its emergence as an American strategic peer in Asia\u2014would be premature if not improbable. Australia should not design its defence force for war with China, but it should be able to counter Chinese coercion and contribute to Allied military operations if necessary.\n\nPaul Dibb is Emeritus Professor of Strategic Studies in the Strategic & Defence Studies Centre, Coral Bell schol of Asia-Pacific Affairs, ANU. He was head of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre from 1991 to 2004. Before that he held the positions of deputy secretary for Defence, director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation and head of the National Assessments Staff. He studied the former Soviet Union for over 20 years both as a senior intelligence officer and academic. He advised ASIO on certain Soviet activities. His book The Soviet Union--the Incomplete Superpower was published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies , London in 1986, reprinted 1987 and second edition 1988.\n\nJohn Lee is an Australian academic working on international economic and security affairs with a focus on the Asia-Pacific. Lee is an adjunct associate professor at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, a Michael Hintze Fellow at the Centre for International Security Studies, University of Sydney and a senior scholar at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC. Lee is a board member of the Institute for Regional Security.",

In the early 1990s, hopes for the eastward spread of liberal democracy were high. And yet the transformation of Eastern European countries gave rise to a bitter repudiation of liberalism itself, not only in the East but also back in the heartland of the West. Krastev and Holmes argue that the supposed end of history turned out to be only the beginning of an Age of Imitation. Reckoning with the history of the last thirty years, they show that the most powerful force behind the wave of populist xenophobia that began in Eastern Europe stems from resentment at the post-1989 imperative to become Westernized.\n\nThe event was organised by the Central European University and the Institute for Human Sciences (IWM).\n\nLearn more:\nwww.ceu.edu\nwww.iwm.at",

                    "description": "Security Council meeting on the Threats to international peace and security (Ukraine).\n\nFollowing weeks of heightened tensions around Ukraine, with reports that Russia has been deploying more than 100,000 troops and heavy weapons close to its border, the United Nations\u2019 Security Council held its first meeting to discuss ways of de-escalating the crisis on Monday. \n\nAddressing ambassadors, the UN political affairs chief reiterated the UN Secretary-General\u2019s appeal that \u201cthere can be no alternative to diplomacy and dialogue\u201d. \n\nHighlighting the \u201ccomplex and long-standing security concerns and threat perceptions that have been raised\u201d, the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Rosemary A. DiCarlo, repeated that any military intervention involving Russia, or NATO alliance forces which are also now on high alert, must be averted.\n\nShe said that any incursion by one State on another\u2019s territory, would be against international law and the United Nations Charter. \n\nAccording to her, it is reported that in addition to the 100,000 troops on Russian soil along Ukraine\u2019s border, unspecified numbers of Russian troops and weaponry are also reportedly being deployed to Belarus ahead of large-scale joint military exercises in February on the borders with Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic States. \n\nNATO members are also reportedly planning additional deployments in Eastern European member states, and NATO has advised that 8,500 troops are now on high alert.\n\n\u201cAccusations and recriminations among the various actors involved in the ongoing discussions have created uncertainty and apprehension for many that a military confrontation is impending\u201d, she said. \n\nDiplomatic efforts\nMs. DiCarlo also welcomed the ongoing diplomatic discussions, saying the UN hopes that a successful de-escalation will strengthen peace and security in Europe. \n\nThese efforts include a 13 January meeting in Vienna held by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and a 21 January meeting between the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, in Geneva.\n\nRead More: ",

                    "description": "Speaking on the second day of the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy challenged members of the European Union and NATO to take their relationship with Ukraine seriously.\nIn emotional remarks, he thanked partners for their rhetorical and material support in the face of Russia's military build up on Ukraine's borders. But he said they have Ukraine to thank for standing up to Russian aggression for years, and protecting the rest of Europe from it.\nStill, Zelenskyy said diplomacy is the only means for Ukraine to regain the territory it lost when Russia attacked in 2014. That led him to question Russian claims that they are not seeking to do so again now.\nChristiane Amanpour was on hand to conduct an in-depth follow-up interview with Zelenskyy.\n\n\nSubscribe: ",

Every spring the pond reawakens with new life and beauty, and every year the UChicago community returns to visit the scenic corner of campus. \n\nThe historic Botany Pond was created as an outdoor research laboratory at the turn of the 20th century by John Merle Coulter, chair of the Department of Botany. In 2004\u2014with funding from the Julie and Parker Hall Botanic Garden Endowment Fund\u2014it underwent a major restoration, allowing it to remain a source of academic study, inspiration, and serenity for the UChicago community. \n\nBotany Pond remains a beloved campus space, enjoyed for its biodiversity that includes water lilies, ginko and akebia trees, turtles, fish, ducks\u2014and even the occasional heron.

                    "description": "In his new essay for the New York-based Foreign Affairs magazine,  Mearsheimer argues that the US and China are locked in a dangerous security competition, more perilous than the first Cold War. In essence, once China grew wealthy, a US-China cold war was inevitable. Had US policymakers understood this logic in the early 1990s, they would have tried to slow down Chinese growth and maximise the power gap between Beijing and Washington.\n\nHowever, the US did the opposite: it pursued a policy of engagement, which aimed to help China grow wealthier \u2013 based on the assumption that China would become a democracy and a responsible stakeholder, which would lead to a more peaceful world. Instead of fostering harmonious relations between China and the US, engagement led to an intense rivalry.\n\nIs Australia and the world in deep trouble? Absent a major internal Chinese crisis, Washington and Beijing are consigned to waging a dangerous security competition. Can we manage on the margins to prevent disaster?\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is professor of political science and international relations at the University of Chicago and author of The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001). He was a guest at the Centre for Independent Studies in 2019. \n\nHost: Tom Switzer is executive director of the Centre for Independent Studies. \n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nCIS promotes free choice and individual liberty and the open exchange of ideas.

            "description": "John Mearsheimer, professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, provides the first systematic analysis of lying as a tool of statecraft. He identifies the varieties, the reasons, and the potential costs and benefits, arguing that leaders often lie for good strategic reasons, while distinguishing between lying to another state and lying to one's own people.\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is also the co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago and has written extensively about security issues and international politics.\n\nThe World Beyond the Headlines is a project of the Center for International Studies, which brings scholars, journalists, and world leaders to the University to discuss issues of current global importance. \n\nFor more information on this event, visit ",

He begins with a discussion of its geographical context: the dry desert lands of the Arabian peninsula. The Bedouins, or nomadic Arabs of the region, lived in a tribal society somewhat similar to the Germanic tribes discussed earlier in the course.  Their raids against the Byzantine and the Persian Empire, for lack of strong opposition, would lead to the Arab conquests. The second half of the lecture focuses on the life of Mohammed (570/580 -- 632) and the early years of Islam. Mohammed's revelation was one of the unity of God and a progressive interpretation of God's prophets, with Mohammed as the last of these.  Early Islam was slow to differentiate itself for Christianity and Judaism, though this process accelerated after Mohammed's flight to Medina in 622. Professor Freedman ends with a discussion of the tenets of Islam and anticipates the discussion of the Arab conquests in the next lecture.",

                    "description": "There is good reason to think China's rise might be the most important development in world politics during the 21st century. America is now the dominant great power in the Asia-Pacific region, and it is often a jealous god. That raises the question: is a powerful China likely to clash with the United States? Moreover, can a rising China live peacefully with its neighbors, including Japan, India, and Vietnam? Mearsheimer will argue that, if China's economic growth continues, it will build much more powerful military forces than it now has and attempt to dominate Asia the way the United States dominates the Western Hemisphere. However, the US and China's neighbors will go to great lengths to contain China and prevent it from becoming a regional hegemon--leading to an intense security competition in the Asia-Pacific region, with the ever-present danger of war.\n\nJohn J. Mearsheimer is the R. Wendell Harrison distinguished service professor of political science and codirector of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, where he has taught since 1982. He graduated from West Point in 1970 and served five years as an officer in the US Air Force before receiving his PhD from Cornell in 1980. Winner of the 1985 Quantrell Award for distinguished teaching, Mearsheimer has written extensively about security issues and international politics, publishing numerous journal articles and five books, including the 2011 Why Leaders Lie: The Truth about Lying in International Politics, which has been translated into ten different languages.",

This comes as Ukrainian authorities and Russian-backed separatists are both accusing the other side of violating a ceasefire in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. For more on the  history behind the present crisis in Ukraine, we speak with one of the last U.S. ambassadors to the Soviet Union prior to the collapse of the USSR, Ambassador Jack Matlock, who says the U.S.-led expansion of NATO following the end of the Cold War helped lay the groundwork for the current standoff over Ukraine. He argues continued escalation could stoke another nuclear arms race, and lays out some of the parallels with the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.",

A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.\n\nFlipchart artwork by Maria Raykova\nFilmed by Raquel Nuno\nThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci",

What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?\n\nHuge thanks to:\nProf. Konstantin Batygin, Caltech\nProf. David Jewitt, UCLA\n\nI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nAlfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige Thorman\n\nMusic from ",

                    "description": "Light is so common that we rarely think about what it really is. But just over two hundred years ago, a groundbreaking experiment answered the question that had occupied physicists for centuries. Is light made up of waves or particles?\n\nThe experiment was conducted by Thomas Young and is known as Young's Double Slit Experiment. This famous experiment is actually a simplification of a series of experiments on light conducted by Young. In a completely darkened room, Young allowed a thin beam of sunlight to pass through an aperture on his window and onto two narrow, closely spaced openings (the double slit). This sunlight then cast a shadow onto the wall behind the apparatus. Young found that the light diffracted as it passed through the slits, and then interfered with itself, created a series of light and dark spots. Since the sunlight consists of all colours of the rainbow, these colours were also visible in the projected spots. Young concluded that light consist of waves and not particles since only waves were known to diffract and interfere in exactly the manner that light did in his experiment.\n\nThe way I have always seen this experiment performed is with a laser and a manufactured double slit but since the experiment was conducted in 1801 I have always thought that it should be possible to recreate the experiment using sunlight and household materials. That is basically what I did here. I will show the interference pattern I observed with my homemade double slit on 2Veritasium but I chose to use a manufactured double slit here to ensure that the pattern was impressive for observers at the beach.\n\nSpecial thanks to Henry, Brady, and Rupert for their cameos, Glen for filming and Josh for helping create the apparatus. Thanks also to the Royal Society for allowing us to view the original manuscript of Young's lecture and the University of Sydney for lending the double slits.\n\nMusic by Kevin Mcleod (incompetech.com) Danse Macabre, Scissors",

How was the gold in our jewelry, the carbon in our bodies, and the iron in our cars made? In this lecture, we will trace the origin of a gold atom from the Big Bang to the present day, and beyond. You will learn how the elements were forged in the nuclear furnaces inside stars, and how, when they die, these massive stars spread the elements into space. You will learn about the origin of the building blocks of matter in the Big Bang, and we will speculate on the future of the atoms around us today.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Edward Murphy, University of Virginia\nDate: November 13, 2012\n\nYou can download a copy of the Table of Elements from this page: ",

If you hit a tennis ball with a racket, a wave has to travel from the strings to your hand before you feel it - and the ball is well on its way to the net by this time. If you hit a golf ball, the ball is well on its way to the hole before you can feel it. Rigid bodies aren't truly rigid and understanding this is essential to understanding the way the world works",
