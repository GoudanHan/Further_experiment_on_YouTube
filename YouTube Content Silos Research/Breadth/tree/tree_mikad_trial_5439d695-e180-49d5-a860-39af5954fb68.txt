Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

How was the gold in our jewelry, the carbon in our bodies, and the iron in our cars made? In this lecture, we will trace the origin of a gold atom from the Big Bang to the present day, and beyond. You will learn how the elements were forged in the nuclear furnaces inside stars, and how, when they die, these massive stars spread the elements into space. You will learn about the origin of the building blocks of matter in the Big Bang, and we will speculate on the future of the atoms around us today.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Edward Murphy, University of Virginia\nDate: November 13, 2012\n\nYou can download a copy of the Table of Elements from this page: ",

He earned his B.A. at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and his Ph.D. in classics from Stanford University. In 2007, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal, and in 2008, he received the Bradley Prize from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. He has written for numerous publications, including the Claremont Review of Books, The New Criterion, and The Wall Street Journal. He is the author of several books, including A War Like No Other: How the Athenians and Spartans Fought the Peloponnesian War and The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won.\n\nXenophon wrote that a successful general \u201cmust be resourceful, active, careful, hardy, and quick-witted; he must be both gentle and brutal, at once straightforward and designing, capable of both caution and surprise, lavish and rapacious, generous and mean, skillful in defense and attack.\u201d This third CCA of the 2019-2020 academic year will consider the lives and characters of some of America\u2019s greatest generals.",

Well known for his sharp wit as well as his originalist approach to the Constitution, Justice Scalia consistently asks more questions during oral arguments and makes more comments than any other Supreme Court justice. And, according to one study, he also gets the most laughs from those who come to watch these arguments. In September 2010, Justice Scalia spoke with UC Hastings law professor Calvin Massey.

This is truly a video for you if you want to learn how to make the perfect steak! I hope you enjoy friends, and start making those Steaks! You will learn 5 very important  things to do.\n#1 Don\u2019t waste your time taking the steak out 20 minutes before cooking it.  It accomplishes NOTHING.\n#2 Do not wait the last minute to salt your steak.  Add salt AT LEAST 45 minutes before cooking it! (one or two days is even better!)\n#3 Get yourself a good instant read thermometer, pushing your thumb in the palm of your hand DOES NOT WORK!\n#4 Searing the steak DOES NOT seal in the juices. (its only purpose is to create a delicious crust)\n#5 Be sure to let it rest at least 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven. Before cutting into it.\n\nRecipe Link: ",
