Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss.

Check out the Intelligence Squared website to hear about future live events and podcasts: http://www.intelligencesquared.com \n__________________________\n\nIn this speech from our 2007 debate, 'We'd be better off without religion', the late Christopher Hitchens argues that religion has been at the root of many of the conflicts that have shaped the 20th-21st century world. \n\nHe cites the current situations in the Balkans, the Middle East, and Northern Ireland as examples, noting that in these places, it has been intra-faith disputes that have caused or aggravated the conflicts and slowed political and social progress.",

This video was recorded at The Australian National University on 10 April 2012.\n\nRichard Dawkins FRS is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford. Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.\n\nHe is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.\n\nRichard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature.

Dawkins' scornful tone drew strongly mixed reactions from the audience; some stood and applauded his courage. Others wondered whether his strident approach could do more harm than good.

Some may feel like random encounters, a rare occurrence, but most can be triggered, and they may lead to secret quests.  Skyrim secrets, honestly, are the best - there's so many secret locations, and many can lead to the best quests, or best weapons and armor in the game.\n\nAs my first time on PC, I absolutely love Skyrim new mods.  Obviously the weapon mods and armor mods are outstanding - they make looking for unique weapons, as well as more hidden locations and hidden items a lot more fun.  Also, I do a lot of Top 5 content, if you're interested.\n\nPlease like, comment, and subscribe, and if you want to connect, my other social media is below : )",

Marriages can be made between the Dragonborn and a seemingly endless number of characters and building a family acts as an interesting relief from all the dungeon crawling and questing we typically find ourselves undertaking in Skyrim. Alas, a few candidates for marriage are particularly unique characters definitely worth some further inspection. So today we\u2019ll be taking a look at my top five choices for wives and husbands in The Elder Scrolls",

Some are in a constant fight for their lives.\n\nHere I list my \"Top 5 Kids Who Need Adoption the Most\" in Skyrim.  Someone could argue these are the best kids to adopt because of their very poor situations.  As such, these can be some of the saddest encounters or locations one can find when exploring.\n\nThat's always a peak of interest - sad encounters.  And in many are hidden things like Skyrim secrets, or weird secret encounters.  Which often lead to fan theories or perhaps your own theory?  Although here, deciding who the best children are comes down to some of the hardest decisions, as, generally speaking, the kids in this land don't give off such a good impression.  Hm.\n\nA teaser for TES6 can be found here if you're pumped:  ",

Yes, if you believe the man you're about to meet. Richard Godfrey is no crackpot; he's a respected British aerospace engineer and physicist who says he's found the doomed airliner. If he's right, he'll provide desperately needed answers for the families of the 239 passengers and crew who were aboard the Boeing triple-seven when it vanished eight years ago.

Go!\u201d someone shouted as the rioters, some in military gear, streamed in. It was the start of the most serious attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. The mob coursed through the building, enraged that Congress was preparing to make Trump\u2019s electoral defeat official. \u201cDrag them out! \u2026 Hang them out!\u201d rioters yelled at one point, as they gathered near the House chamber.\n\nOfficials in the House and Senate secured the doors of their respective chambers, but lawmakers were soon forced to retreat to undisclosed locations. Five people died on the grounds that day, including a Capitol police officer. In all, more than 50 officers were injured.\n\nTo reconstruct the pandemonium inside the Capitol, The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and hundreds of videos, some of which were exclusively obtained. By synchronizing the footage and locating some of the camera angles within a digital 3-D model of the building, The Post was able to map the rioters\u2019 movements and assess how close they came to lawmakers \u2014 in some cases feet apart or separated only by a handful of vastly outnumbered police officers.

It was one of the city's few media outlets that dared to criticize Beijing. What happens now? We accompany two former staffers: a reporter and a photographer.\n\nPun has won awards for his investigative reporting. Harry is proud of every one of his photos that was published in the \"Apple Daily\". Now both young men are out of work and don\u2019t know what to do next. Some of their former colleagues gave up journalism even before the newspaper closed down, while others are now being brought to court. That\u2019s because, in 2020, China introduced its controversial Hong Kong National Security Law. As a result, even a newspaper article could be viewed as \"inciting subversion\" or \"colluding with foreign forces\" in the eyes of the law. This has made life even harder for journalists working in the Special Administrative Region. They say that the demise of \"Apple Daily\" has dealt a severe blow to press freedom in Hong Kong.

From a poor agrarian society, it has now emerged as an industrial powerhouse, contributing nearly 30 percent of the world's economic growth. It has even overtaken Japan as the world\u2019s second largest economy and lifted 800 million people out of poverty within just a single generation. \n\nBut 70 years on, the Communist Party of China under the leadership of its strongman President Xi Jinping is facing the greatest test of its leadership. The continuing social unrest in Hong Kong, a slowing economy and the escalating trade war with the United States are threatening its undermine his China dream. Can the tremendous progress that China has achieved so far simply falter from now on? Or will China continue to prevail as a force to be reckoned with in spite of all these challenges 70 years after its birth?\n\n==========================\nABOUT THE SHOW: Insight investigates and analyses topical issues that impact Asia and the rest of the world.

But of late, sweeping changes to its internal security and electoral laws appear to have sapped the vitality and freedom that the city is once famous for. The new laws have granted Beijing sweeping powers to exert its control over the city, launch a crackdown on dissent and stop the growth of anti-China sentiment in the territory.  \n\nIs Hong Kong\u2019s much cherished freedom under attack? Has the last vestige of democracy been crushed following the introduction of these laws?  And with China tightening its grip over the city, will Hong Kong gradually lose its sparkle and competitive edge as an global financial hub?\n\nFor greater INSIGHT into issues affecting Asia: ",

The SPLA quickly fractured into two camps: an insurgency drawn from members of former vice president Riek Machar's Nuer tribe and troops who remained loyal to President Salva Kiir, of the Dinka tribe. Both sides have been accused of committing gross human rights abuses during the conflict. VICE News arrived in Juba and found the army desperate to dispel rumors that rebels were advancing on the capital. Soldiers were keen to take our correspondents on a trip with them into the bush to recapture the strategic city of Bor from the rebels... only the raid didn't turn out quite as they had expected.\n\nCheck out the VICE News beta for more: ",

Visit http://store.dftba.com/products/crash... to buy a set for your home or classroom.\n\nIn which John Green teaches you about capitalism and socialism in a way that is sure to please commenters from both sides of the debate. Learn how capitalism arose from the industrial revolution, and then gave rise to socialism. Learn about how we got from the British East India Company to iPhones and consumer culture in just a couple of hundred years. Stops along the way include the rise of industrial capitalism, mass production, disgruntled workers, Karl Marx, and the Socialist Beard.
