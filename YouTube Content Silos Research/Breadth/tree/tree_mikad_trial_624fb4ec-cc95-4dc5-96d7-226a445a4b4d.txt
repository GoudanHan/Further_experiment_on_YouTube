My goal is to always provide accurate and honest test results by avoiding outside pressure from manufacturers. To do this, I always buy all of the products that I test along with the test equipment and supplies used for the testing.

Between 1937 and 1947 over 20,000 of them were built and in those 10 years, Spitfires changed dramatically from the Mk 1 to the Mk 24. More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world. In this episode of Duxford in Depth, Graham Rodgers looks at how the Spitfire evolved by taking us through just a few of Duxford's collection of Spitfires including marks 1, 5, 9, 14, and 24.\n\nFrom 27 December until 20 February, see a world-first at IWM Duxford \u2013 the largest collection of Spitfires ever assembled under one roof!

You will learn how the elements were forged in the nuclear furnaces inside stars, and how, when they die, these massive stars spread the elements into space. You will learn about the origin of the building blocks of matter in the Big Bang, and we will speculate on the future of the atoms around us today.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Edward Murphy, University of Virginia\nDate: November 13, 2012\n\nYou can download a copy of the Table of Elements from this page: ",

Which made it a hard sell in its time.\n\nThe FD RX-7 was developed at the same time, by the same man, as the 4-rotor 787B that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans. \n\nIt was a lightweight, fast, focused sports car that walloped its competition on the road and on track, thanks to a sequential twin-turbocharged rotary engine and a obsessive lightweighting.\n\nBut it might have gone too far. The 13B-REW engine is fragile and finicky, and the chassis was one last-second reinforcement away from being too light to be structurally sound.\n\nThen again, what sports car doesn't suffer from a few problems? At least the RX-7 had incredible performance and looks to kill. It was designed to be a classic, with forms that would make it one day appear on the lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Given how well it's aging, there's little doubt the most beautiful sports car to come out of Japan in decades will one day appear on the lawn.\n\nWhich is also a shame, because where this RX-7 really shines is on the road.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice investigate the limits of temperature and a lot more. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn why there\u2019s really no limit of how hot you can make something. On the flip side, we dive into why making things colder is a different story. How do you create a place where there is no heat? You\u2019ll find out more about the Kelvin scale or absolute temperature scale. \n\nNeil takes us through the process of cooling things down. Discover the differences between temperature and heat energy. We explore the vibration of particles and dip our toes into Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution. Then, Neil tells us why we can never philosophically or theoretically reach absolute zero. \n\nTo wrap things up, we investigate what happens when quantum physics take over. Discover more about superfluidity. All that, plus, you\u2019ll hear about the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate and how we can \u201cshape-shift\u201d matter.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: ",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

He is the author of nine works of history, including the first two volumes of his planned three-volume history of Russian power and Joseph Stalin, Paradoxes of Power, 1878\u20131928 and Waiting for Hitler, 1929\u20131941. The premise of this show is simple: Peter Robinson poses five questions to Dr. Kotkin: what Xi Jinping, the president of China believes; what Vladimir Putin believes; whether nuclear weapons are a deterrent in the 21st century; the chances of another American renewal; and Kotkin\u2019s rational basis for loving the United States. It\u2019s a fascinating conversation that delves deep into one of the country\u2019s brightest minds. \n\nFor further information: ",

Craig is one of the world\u2019s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the \u201cnew atheism\u201d movement. \n\nIn front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christ\u2019s resurrection. It was a compelling clash of worldviews and an examination of the major arguments for and against Christianity and atheism.",
