                "description": "Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), devoid of bedside manner and dealing with his own constant physical pain, uses a cane that punctuates his acerbic, brutally honest demeanor. His behavior often borders on antisocial, but House is a brilliant diagnostician whose unconventional thinking and flawless instincts afford him a great deal of respect. An infectious disease specialist, he thrives on the challenge of solving medical puzzles in order to save lives. House shepherds an elite team of experts who help him unravel diagnostic mysteries. He has a confidant and good friend in oncology specialist Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), and maintains a somewhat volatile and undefined relationship with Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), the Dean of Medicine and hospital administrator. Though the two are in constant conflict over House's duties and unconventional behavior, even she would admit that his brilliance is worth the trouble.",

                        "description": "Extract from \"Role Model\", the seventeenth episode of the first season of House, which premiered on the Fox network on April 12, 2005. \n\nAt the conference, House gives an extremely brief (two-sentence), monotonous and lackluster speech in a weak attempt to pacify Vogler. However Vogler is not satisfied and orders House to step it up or he will force him to fire either Foreman or Cameron again. House then returns to the podium and tells the ugly truth about Vogler's drug: it's not a new drug at all, but rather an old drug whose patent is about to expire, forcing Vogler's company to reformulate it with an additional medication to create a \"new\" drug, which they will encourage doctors to prescribe rather than the soon-to-be less expensive old drug that's about to go into generic status. House's staff, all present for the speech, react in ways showing their disbelief (Foreman shakes his head, Chase downs the rest of his glass of wine, Cameron looks torn between admiration and sorrow). House sarcastically mentions to Vogler, \"I threw in a joke\" (after Vogler had earlier asked him to), leaving Vogler to speak to the audience.\n\nThis is one of my favourite clips, I think House shows true integrity here.",

                    "description": "Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), devoid of bedside manner and dealing with his own constant physical pain, uses a cane that punctuates his acerbic, brutally honest demeanor. His behavior often borders on antisocial, but House is a brilliant diagnostician whose unconventional thinking and flawless instincts afford him a great deal of respect. An infectious disease specialist, he thrives on the challenge of solving medical puzzles in order to save lives. House shepherds an elite team of experts who help him unravel diagnostic mysteries. He has a confidant and good friend in oncology specialist Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), and maintains a somewhat volatile and undefined relationship with Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), the Dean of Medicine and hospital administrator. Though the two are in constant conflict over House's duties and unconventional behavior, even she would admit that his brilliance is worth the trouble.",

                    "description": "Former US submarine commander L. David Marquet rated the realism of submarine scenes in popular movies, judging their technological accuracy as well as the depiction of life on board.\n\nMarquet addresses the realism of nuclear crisis movies, such as \"The World Is Not Enough\" and \"K-19: The Widowmaker,\". He also rated the accuracy of standoff scenes in \"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"The Enemy Below\", \"Hunter Killer,\" and \"Crimson Tide.\" He also breaks down the realism of costumes, tactics, and terminology from \"U-571.\"\n\nIs life on board a submarine, including confined conditions and drills, as depicted in \"Das Boot\"? Would Navy SEALs enter a submarine from a HALO drop similar to \"Act of Valor\", and is it possible for a submarine to hear music from the water's surface, like in  \"The Wolf's Call\"? Can holes on a submarine be plugged with pins and other metal objects, as we see in \"The Simpsons\"? Would nuclear missiles be triggered by dislodging in a ship interior, such as in \"Aquaman\"?\n\nMarquet graduated top of his class from the US Naval Academy and served for 28 years on submarines, including as an engineer officer aboard the USS Will Rogers, then as captain on the USS Olympia and the USS Santa Fe. Having retired in 2009, he is now a Wall Street Journal best-selling author of \"Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders.\"\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

My 10 challenges were apparently so impossible that no one attempted a single one of them, despite the numerous pathetic attempts at response videos. It has become clear that even though I've been explaining middle school level science in these videos, it's still way too far above their heads, so with this one I really wanted to break it down even further for them. Here's a tidy little morsel of flat earth destruction that requires precisely zero scientific knowledge to comprehend. Enjoy.\n\nPart 2 in this series: ",

But a star will move between these categories over its lifetime. How does that happen, exactly? And what is leftover when a star dies? A white dwarf? A neutron star? A black hole? What are these objects? Let's answer all of these questions and more by analyzing the life cycle of a few different star types!\n\nWatch the whole Astronomy/Astrophysics playlist: ",

There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?\n\nWatch the whole Astronomy/Astrophysics playlist: ",

Let's see before I get really serious about that Kurosawa length Galois theory video :)\n\nToday's video is another self-contained story of mathematical discovery covering millennia of math, starting from pretty much nothing and finishing with a mathematical mega weapon that usually only real specialists dare to touch. I worked really hard on this one. Fingers crossed that after all this work the video now works for you :) Anyway, lots of things to look forward to: a ton of power sum formulas, animations of a couple of my favourite \u201cproofs without words\u201d, the mysterious Bernoulli numbers (the numbers to \"rule them all\" as far as power sums go), the (hopefully) most accessible introduction to the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula ever, and much more.\n\nHere is a link to a couple of slides that show how to justify having all summations in sight run from 1 to n. This is the challenge that follows the discussion at ",

It will be broadcast in mid-2015, details to come. The filming took me to the most radioactive places on Earth (and some places, which surprisingly aren't as radioactive as you'd think). Chernobyl and Fukushima were incredible to see as they present post-apocalyptic landscapes. I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.\n\nNotes about measuring radiation:\nSieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.\n\nObviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.",
