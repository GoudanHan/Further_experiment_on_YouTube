Building on more than 25 years of research on the associations between exposure to environmental pollutants and health effects, \u201cCount Down \u2013 How our modern world is threatening sperm counts, altering male and female reproductive development and imperiling the future of the human race\u201d is a clarion call for more protective public policies and changes in our modern way or living.\n\nThe Health and Environment Alliance (HEAL) sat down with Dr. Swan to discuss the main findings of her book, as well as her recommendations for more protective public policies. Her presentation was followed by a panel discussion featuring two guest speakers: \n\n- Dr. Majorie van Duursen is a professor of toxicology at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam and the coordinator of one of Europe\u2019s leading research projects to upgrade testing methods on endocrine disrupting, FREIA (Female Reproductive Toxicity of EDCs \u2013 A Human Evidence-Based Screening and Identification Approach), which aims at developing new test methods to identify EDCs toxic to female reproduction.\n\n- Dr. Lola G\u00f3mez Roig is the Head of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department at the Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, University of Barcelona and and a member of the International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO), where she sits and actively participates in the committee on reproductive developmental & environmental health.\n\nTo find out more about HEAL\u2019s work to minimize exposure to toxic chemicals, visit our website and sign up to our newsletter: ",

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

Pierre-Marie Robitaille is a former radiologist who likes to pretend that he understands astrophysics better than astrophysicists. He doesn't. When he talks, he makes ridiculous claims and blatant errors that can be spotted by anyone with a basic understanding of physics and astronomy. Nevertheless, many gullible people speak about him like he's a genius, so I thought I'd explain quite thoroughly how he definitely isn't. If you're someone who has fallen for his lies, please watch.\n\nOther debunks in this genre:\nDebunking the SAFIRE Project: ",

This video combines them all into one narrative, fully upgrades all of the visuals, and adds extra historical notes and clarifications along the way. Please let me know if you enjoyed this, and are interested in more videos like this. There are many historical miniseries on this channel that would fit neatly into a compilation like this, and I'd be thrilled to make them!\n\nSOURCES & Further Reading: Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Polybius' \"Histories\", Livy's \"Ab Urbe Condita\" Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\", Caesar's \"De Bello Gallico\", \"SPQR\" by Mary Beard, \"Rome: A History in Seven Sackings\" by Matt Kneale, \"Rubicon\" by Tom Holland, \"The Storm Before the Storm\" by Mike Duncan, (and also my degree in Classical Studies).\n\nSECTION TIME-CODES:",

He and I exchanged some words regarding racism, politics, and psychology, and hilarity ensued. As a disclaimer, there is no educational merit to this exchange whatsoever. This is 90 minutes of Jesse saying the dumbest things imaginable, and me mocking him relentlessly in response. Only watch this if that sounds entertaining to you.\n\nNote: I turned off comments because I got tired of spending 1-2 hours a day explaining basic logic to ignorant bigots. If you were planning to drop a comment on another video, or message me on some other platform, please first read the following:\n1) Out of wedlock does not mean single. You don't have be married to raise children together, and in fact, black couples disproportionately don't marry. Out of wedlock does not equal single parent. Read that sentence as  many times as you need to in order to get it into your skull. Jesse misrepresented the statistic, and then piled other claims on top regarding crime and drug use with no basis. He was wrong. Let me repeat. He was wrong.\n2) Jesse's ancestors were indeed slaves. He was lying. He is a liar. Google it.\n3) The history of slavery is irrelevant, so stop acting like you're a history scholar. It doesn't matter if there were times that slavery wasn't racist. When one race enslaves another race, it's racist.\n4) If you were planning on saying nothing but spewing Jesse's catch phrases, congratulations, you are among the dumbest people alive.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates/discussions: ",
