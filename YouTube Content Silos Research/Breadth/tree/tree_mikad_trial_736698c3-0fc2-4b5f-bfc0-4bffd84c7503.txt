These are just some of the names for that continental sized nation which Alaska wishes it could touch. You'll be surprised to know that other names were considered for the new nation during the American Revolution against Britain and that a name wasn't settled on until the Constitutional Congress. Until other ideas, like Columbia or Fredonia were proposed. So why did the Founding Fathers choose the name 'United States of America'. Find out in this video, the latest in my very short, animated historical documentaries (about history).\n\nGod Bless Fredonia.\n\nTwitter: ",

How it is possible for primitive life forms to spawn the millions of different creatures, that exist today. Unfortunately, evolution is often misunderstood, because it's mechanisms seem counter intuitive. By using visualizations, infographics and appealing characters, the viewer is more likely to understand it the complex information. More than that, by presenting the information in an entertaining way, the information is more likely to sink in. \n\nShort videos, explaining things. For example Evolution, the Universe, Stock Market or controversial topics like Fracking. Because we love science.\n\nWe would love to interact more with you, our viewers to figure out what topics you want to see. If you have a suggestion for future videos or feedback, drop us a line! :)\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nGerman Channel: ",
