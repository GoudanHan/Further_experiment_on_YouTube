In what was the troupe\u2019s third, and highly controversial, film, Monty Python delivers a scathing, anarchic satire of both religion and Hollywood\u2019s depiction of all things biblical.",

                "description": "Republicans in Florida and Texas passed new laws targeting technology companies for banning or \"canceling\" certain speech -- an uphill battle, as a federal judge blocked the Texas law as unconstitutional. Renowned free speech lawyer Floyd Abrams agrees, saying the new GOP laws violate the First Amendment because media and tech companies have the legal right to decide what to publish. Abrams, the \"most sought-after First Amendment litigator of his generation,\" according to New York Times, speaks out on those laws, free speech in the digital age, reporter's privilege, his litigation against Rudy Giuliani and for Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump's \"danger,\" and a range of legal and political issues in this wide-ranging interview with Ari Melber, who used to practice law with Abrams. This is the newest installment of The Summit Series with Ari Melber, featuring discussions with leaders at the summit of their fields. The series debuted in 2021 with Melber\u2019s interview with Bill Gates. \n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: ",

Documentary Filmmaker, The Red Pill \n\nCassie Jaye founded Jaye Bird Productions in 2008, which has since produced a  collection  of documentary films that have been praised for being thought-provoking, entertaining and respectful in representing multiple competing views within each film. Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye\u2019s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.",

He is currently a Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the New School University in New York City. He wrote Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism and founded www.democracyatwork.info, a non-profit advocacy organization of the same name that promotes democratic workplaces as a key path to a stronger, democratic economic system.\n\nProfessor Wolff discusses the economic dimensions of our lives, our jobs, our incomes, our debts, those of our children, and those looming down the road in his unique mixture of deep insight and dry humor. He presents current events and draws connections to the past to highlight the machinations of our global economy. He helps us to understand political and corporate policy, organization of labor, the distribution of goods and services, and challenges us to question some of the deepest foundations of our society.

Dr. Zizek is a Slovenian philosopher and professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, whose works on cultural studies, psychoanalysis and, above all, for the purposes of our debate, Marxism, are world-renowned. The topic? Happiness: Marxism vs Capitalism. This is the official video. Many bootlegs have already been released, but that seems inevitable given our current state of technological capability. \n\nI started with a critique of The Communist Manifesto, which is the central revolutionary document of the Marxist movement (rather than addressing, say, Zizek's work, which wasn't what the debate was about). \n\nIt wasn't so obvious for the rest of the discussion that Marxism, per se, comprised the central topic of discussion.\n\nWatch for yourself.\n\nA good article, I think, on Zizek: ",

Hsu in his Americans and Chinese: two ways of life (1953), described the people of both countries as culturally and psychologically exceptional. Today all the talk is about two powerful countries, exceptional now in a different world. Like the book, this lecture will focus on people. Were Chinese who left China exceptional, or exceptional only after they left? Did it matter if they moved not to the West but within the region? When they remained or became Chinese, was that what distinguished them outside China? For several centuries, more than 90 per cent of them lived, worked and settled in various parts of the Nanyang or Southeast Asia. What was exceptional and Chinese about them, and what happens when China now seeks to be exceptional anew?\n\nThis talk is part of the Institute of East Asian Studies Distinguished Speaker Series.",

                    "description": "In his new essay for the New York-based Foreign Affairs magazine,  Mearsheimer argues that the US and China are locked in a dangerous security competition, more perilous than the first Cold War. In essence, once China grew wealthy, a US-China cold war was inevitable. Had US policymakers understood this logic in the early 1990s, they would have tried to slow down Chinese growth and maximise the power gap between Beijing and Washington.\n\nHowever, the US did the opposite: it pursued a policy of engagement, which aimed to help China grow wealthier \u2013 based on the assumption that China would become a democracy and a responsible stakeholder, which would lead to a more peaceful world. Instead of fostering harmonious relations between China and the US, engagement led to an intense rivalry.\n\nIs Australia and the world in deep trouble? Absent a major internal Chinese crisis, Washington and Beijing are consigned to waging a dangerous security competition. Can we manage on the margins to prevent disaster?\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is professor of political science and international relations at the University of Chicago and author of The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001). He was a guest at the Centre for Independent Studies in 2019. \n\nHost: Tom Switzer is executive director of the Centre for Independent Studies. \n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nCIS promotes free choice and individual liberty and the open exchange of ideas.

In this sobering talk, atmospheric scientist Brian Toon explains how even a small nuclear war could destroy all life on earth -- and what we can do to prevent it. A professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Brian Toon investigates the causes of the ozone hole, how volcanic eruptions alter the climate, how ancient Mars had flowing rivers, and the environmental impacts of nuclear war. He contributed to the U.N.\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize for climate change and holds numerous scientific awards, including two NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement. He is an avid woodworker. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

He identifies the varieties, the reasons, and the potential costs and benefits, arguing that leaders often lie for good strategic reasons, while distinguishing between lying to another state and lying to one's own people.\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is also the co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago and has written extensively about security issues and international politics.\n\nThe World Beyond the Headlines is a project of the Center for International Studies, which brings scholars, journalists, and world leaders to the University to discuss issues of current global importance. \n\nFor more information on this event, visit ",

Every spring the pond reawakens with new life and beauty, and every year the UChicago community returns to visit the scenic corner of campus. \n\nThe historic Botany Pond was created as an outdoor research laboratory at the turn of the 20th century by John Merle Coulter, chair of the Department of Botany. In 2004\u2014with funding from the Julie and Parker Hall Botanic Garden Endowment Fund\u2014it underwent a major restoration, allowing it to remain a source of academic study, inspiration, and serenity for the UChicago community. \n\nBotany Pond remains a beloved campus space, enjoyed for its biodiversity that includes water lilies, ginko and akebia trees, turtles, fish, ducks\u2014and even the occasional heron.

How was the gold in our jewelry, the carbon in our bodies, and the iron in our cars made? In this lecture, we will trace the origin of a gold atom from the Big Bang to the present day, and beyond. You will learn how the elements were forged in the nuclear furnaces inside stars, and how, when they die, these massive stars spread the elements into space. You will learn about the origin of the building blocks of matter in the Big Bang, and we will speculate on the future of the atoms around us today.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Edward Murphy, University of Virginia\nDate: November 13, 2012\n\nYou can download a copy of the Table of Elements from this page: ",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",
