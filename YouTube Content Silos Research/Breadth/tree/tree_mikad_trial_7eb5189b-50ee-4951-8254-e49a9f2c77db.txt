There exists an obscure fad called the electric universe, which tends to attract exemplars of the Dunning-Kruger effect who think they understand physics better than Einstein. Literally. Although not quite as ridiculous as the flat earth, it's still pretty ridiculous, so let's go through the finer points of precisely why that is the case, shall we?\n\nWatch my other debunks: ",

Isn't life way too complex for that to happen? It seems ridiculous, right? Well, no. Not if you understand biochemistry, which creationists do not. But every once in a while, a hero emerges from academia to champion the cause of the creationist, and lend some illusory credence to their views. In this case, that hero is James Tour, a synthetic organic chemist who insists that abiogenesis is impossible, and he should know better than anyone, because he's a chemist. I was made aware of Dr. Tour after a couple hundred people linked me to a video of his in an empty argument from authority, insisting that because a chemist confirms their religious bias, they must be right. But is Dr. Tour a bit biased himself? Let's find out precisely what his agenda is, shall we?\n\nUpdate: James Tour responded to this single video with a dumpster fire of a 14-part series overflowing with stupidity and lies, which qualifies for the Dunning-Kruger Hall of Fame. Naturally I tore through it like tissue paper, so to watch me do that please check out my two-part response which exposes his fraudulence ten times more thoroughly than this video:\nPart 1: ",

It's called structured water, or hexagonal water. Or at least that's what some would have you believe so that they can sell you devices that will \"structure\" the water you drink and make it better for you. Also, did you know that water responds to emotions, and has memory, just like humans? No wait, that's another lie with zero substantiation. Man, people really lie a lot about water, don't they?

This is the notion that the positions of the stars and planets in the sky at the moment of your birth have an influence on your characteristics, and that their positions over time influence daily events. Can this be possible? By what mechanism does this influence propagate? If it's true, why haven't we encountered anything like this in our study of astronomy? Shouldn't we be able to do experiments to test its validity? We sure can. Let's take a real good look at what astrology proposes, and see if we can to the bottom of whether there is any truth to it or not.\n\nLarge-scale study showing no correlation between date of birth and personality: ",

There are many colorful examples we will cover, but this first part will focus on the main conspiracy surrounding water, and that is the fluoridation of tap water. From government mind control to neurotoxic effects, there is no shortage of misinformation associated with this incredible achievement of modern society, so let's run through the most common talking points and see what they're all about, shall we?\n\nFluoride mechanisms of action:\nFeatherstone review of 1990s work: ",

But nothing is truly out of bounds for science. If it's real, it can be studied, and tested. Perhaps the greatest misunderstanding our culture has about the scientific method involves the definition of the word \"theory\". A theory is not a guess, and this word does not in any way imply uncertainty about the validity of a concept or an equation.

We just have to look at things in the sky with our eyeballs. In fact, that's how we figured out the earth is a sphere thousands of years ago, before science even existed. Last time we looked at the moon, so today let's look at the stars. How do they move through the sky, and can we make sense of it on a flat earth? Spoiler: no, we definitely can't. But be a lamb and watch anyway, would you?\n\nPart 1 in this series: ",
