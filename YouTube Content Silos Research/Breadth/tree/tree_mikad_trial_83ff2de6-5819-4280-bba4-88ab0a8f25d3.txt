To be honest I pandered a bit with this one. I tried to make it like my Skyrim VR review. SO the first thing I did was sit down and make a list of all the things that make me think of Minecraft. Creepers, TNT, Lava, Mods, and covered them all in detail as the video goes on. \n\nMaking this Minecraft VR review was in fact though an absolute nightmare, I really over did the number of edits and scenes required.

I really enjoyed this game as a VR experience but my biggest issues come with the level design and lack of stealthy puzzles. However in terms of a game designed for VR, Budget Cuts is so well implemented to work for the Vive it\u2019s the first big step a game has made to be a true VR title. \n\nMy let\u2019s play channel: ",

No major story spoilers but I talk about Half Life: Alyx\u2019s gameplay at length.\n\nVirtual Reality finally has a game I think most can agree is a great game that has been made excellent in VR. I may not be a Half Life fan as such, but I have played Half Life 1 and 2, and Half Life: Alyx has made me fall in love with the series.\n\nHalf Life Alyx is without a doubt the best virtual reality game I have ever played, I compare it a lot to Boneworks and The Walking Dead: Saint and Sinners because I think it highlights where those games missed the mark a little, and what future games need to try and do to make VR really take off as a platform. \n\nI played Half Life: Alyx on the Index, but it seems to play just as well on the Vive. I would recommend the Index version as the Index has the best virtual Reality controllers I have used so far. \nAnyway, that\u2019s enough of me talking about VR, go get Half Life: Alyx if you can!",

Fry was joined on stage at the Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall by Richard Dawkins and the two discussed Hitch's unflinching commitment to the truth. \n\nHollywood actor Sean Penn was beamed in from LA by Google+ and, between cigarette puffs, read from Hitch's acclaimed work, The Trial of Henry Kissinger. Five friends of Hitch spoke via satellite in New York: satirist Christopher Buckley and editor Lewis Lapham mused on Hitch's prowess as a journalist. 'Like a pot of gold', said Lapham. Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie and James Fenton delighted the audience with stories of Hitchens as a young man. Rushdie drew roars of laughter when he recounted a word game invented by Amis and Hitchens where the word 'love' is replaced with 'hysterical sex'. Particular favourites included Hysterical Sex in the Time of Cholera and Hysterical Sex Is All You Need.\n\nWatching the event with Hitch at his bedside in Texas, Hitch's wife Carol and novelist Ian McEwan provided an email commentary. 'His Rolls Royce mind is still purring beautifully', typed McEwan.\n\nThe event was watched live by 2500 at the venue, and by thousands more in UK cinemas and online.",

Craig is one of the world\u2019s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the \u201cnew atheism\u201d movement. \n\nIn front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christ\u2019s resurrection.

Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

                    "description": "It was a cold, dark, damp night in the small town of Boston. There were leaves laying all over the ground, rotting away. These didn\u2019t help, as our main goal was to stay quiet so we wouldn\u2019t alert anyone. You see, it was on this night, this cold, dark, damp night that I and THE Neil Cicierega (from Lemon Demon and Potter Puppet Pals and New Kids On the Rock) were out sneaking around in a graveyard to uncover a secret Neil had left here many years ago. He said it was a life changing artifact of an ancient experiment he conducted long ago. \n\u201cNeil, is this the right way?\u201d I asked timidly. He didn\u2019t even look towards me as he grunted in a way that could only mean \u2018Yes, probably.\u2019 As a small gust of wind blew past us, Neil stopped, and looked in the direction of a single cracked, lonesome tombstone. This surely was the grave where he had stashed his stash! He stood up from his previous crouching position, and took off his plastic goggles he had over his glasses to keep the cold, dark, damp night out of them. He then walked forward, much less cautiously than before, brandishing his shovel he had brought with us. I quickly followed suit, assuming our stealth was no longer necessary. Slowly walking towards his prize, he started getting slightly\u2026 peculiar, in his actions.\n\u201cYour body is so sweet now\u2026 baby\u2026\u201d Neil began to sing, his gaze fixated on the tombstone. \u201cI\u2019m saying trick or treat now~...\u201d he sang, closing the gap between him and his monolith reminder of his prior work. He reeled back his shovel, and without hesitation sank it into the cold, dark, damp ground. He began his work uncovering his possessions, all the while I stayed completely silent, not daring to interrupt Neil\u2019s dramatic moment.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019ve got to have ya\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d he serenaded his relic, \u201cYou sexy, sweet cadaver~...\u201d I was beginning to ponder the buried treasure in question. A cadaver? That doesn\u2019t sound like some weird science experiment from the early 1900s, that sounds like the medical term for a dead body!\nIt was now when Neil started to pant, either from the exercise he was doing or from some other weird thing only computer nerds experience, like asthma. However, he quickly continued his digging, not letting his lungs halt his progress.\n\u201cAll wrapped up like a mummy\u2026\u201d he belted out, \u201cI\u2019ll cover you in honey!\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure he was on some kind of drug. I\u2019m not sure what kind though. Anyway, he dug and dug, getting weary. But, he made progress, as when I walked up closer to him I began to see what was lying beneath the ground.\n\u201cWait a hundred years or so,\u201d Neil was practically yelling now,  his singing starting to get much louder. And, it must have been from the sight of his dormant property, as sitting there, inside a corroded stone casket, was the dead body of Ryan Murphy! That\u2019s right, Neil Cicierega\u2019s coworker and long-time psychic friend Ryan Murphy was dead and inside a stone tomb for probably a hundred years! And that\u2019s not the strangest part. Ryan was encased in a solid state of honey! Photorealistic honey! Cold, dark, damp, photorealistic honey!  \n\u201cOh you know, you know-\u201d Neil\u2019s chanting began to climax, but was sharply interrupted by the sounds of police sirens wailing on the other side of the graveyard. Neil paused for a moment, still dazed from his cadaver-candy trance. Then, very suddenly, he grabbed me by the shoulder, and began to run. I followed him without a second thought, not wanting to be involved in whatever situation the police would bring. We ran fast, faster, even faster than that one guy from that movie! We were slowly but surely getting away, but Neil still felt the need to yell to the cops to clarify our situation in case we were caught.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t sexual! Strictly confectional!\u201d He shouted, \u201cStrictly medicinal!! If a little nontraditional!\u201d\nAnd then, we got away. We made it out of the graveyard, and away from the Murphy concoction beneath the soil. As a wolf howled, we split up, walking back to our separate cars to go back to our separate lives. \nThen, years later, Neil wrote a song about it and put it on his hit Lemon Demon album Spirit Phone and got tons of money and internet clout. He of course altered the story of it a bit, but the main parts are still in there like the grave robbing and the cop chase scene. But, that\u2019s pretty much how Sweet Bod got written. And remember, if Neil denies any of this ever happening, he\u2019s lying.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease somebody make this into a copypasta, I beg of you.",
