In these battles, Caesar and his legionaries fought against Helvetii led by Divico, Suebi led by Ariovistus, Belgae led by Galba, Nervii led by Boduognatus, Britons led by Cassivellaunus, Eburones led by Ambiorix and Arverni led by Vercingetorix. The Roman Civil war against Pompey is just around the corner. \n\nOur podcast on the history of the Celts: ",

Who is this man, who did he sell the world to, and most importantly, what even is a gazely stare? It's hard to say for sure, but however you choose to read the song, it's drenched in pain and loss, and those same feelings have inspired musicians for generations since Bowie first wrote it.\n\nPatreon: ",

There's nothing quite like it, but it still captures the sound of rock music in the mid '70s, and that blend of the unconventional and the iconic singlehandedly changed the fortunes of a struggling rock band. Kansas had built a following, but Carry On put them on the map, and almost 50 years later, it still stands as one of the greatest classic rock anthems ever recorded.\n\nPatreon: ",

                "description": "Carry On Wayward Son is one of those songs that's both totally unique and perfectly emblematic of a larger musical movement. There's nothing quite like it, but it still captures the sound of rock music in the mid '70s, and that blend of the unconventional and the iconic singlehandedly changed the fortunes of a struggling rock band. Kansas had built a following, but Carry On put them on the map, and almost 50 years later, it still stands as one of the greatest classic rock anthems ever recorded.\n\nPatreon: ",

This one starts with the opera section and goes through the rest of it from there. Honestly, these are some of the most interesting parts of the song, the parts that really make it unique in the rock canon, so this video turned out even longer. Whoops!\n\nPatreon: ",

Fortunately, most new songwriters tend to make the same sorts of mistakes, especially if you're willing to abstract away some of the details, so today I thought I'd offer some guidance in how to handle what is, I think, one of the most common mistakes of all: Trying to get too clever. It's a really tempting trap, and all of us fall into it at one point or another in our development, but with a little attention to detail, it's really not that hard to get past. You just have to realize you're doing it first.\n\nPatreon: ",

Choices they made on their early albums have had ripple effects through the decades, helping shape the genre into what it is today, so in order to better understand one of my favorite styles of music, I thought it was finally time to go back to the source. Iron Man is one of the most enduring tracks from those early Sabbath days, and its almost cinematic approach to songwriting makes it a classic in its own right.\n\nPatreon: ",

I also explore how tech and oil companies with dubious business practices use music as part of propaganda campaigns to convince the public that they support ecological activism. With some music theory thrown in along the way, I also compose a few kinds of different corporate styles to show the various tropes that exist. Some of it is blundering nonsense. Some of it is a little more sinister. All of it is garbage. Enjoy!\n\n---\n\nTwitter: ",
