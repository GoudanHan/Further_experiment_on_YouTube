A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.\n\nFlipchart artwork by Maria Raykova\nFilmed by Raquel Nuno\nThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci",

What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?\n\nHuge thanks to:\nProf. Konstantin Batygin, Caltech\nProf. David Jewitt, UCLA\n\nI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nAlfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige Thorman\n\nMusic from ",

                    "description": "Does quantum entanglement make faster-than-light communication possible?\nWhat is NOT random? http://bit.ly/NOTrandoVe\nFirst, I know this video is not easy to understand. Thank you for taking the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with two of them).\n\nDoes hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden variables must update faster than light - they would be considered 'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be conserved in the universe.\n\nEveryone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability of up/down.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Stephen Bartlett, University of Sydney: ",

                    "description": "Tobias Capwell is the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. Here, he reacts to 11 memorable scenes featuring medieval weapons and armor and rates them based on their historical accuracy. \n\nCapwell looks at armor and weapons within fantasy franchises, such as Sauron's armor in the battle of Orodruin in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001).  He addresses how helmets in \"The Mandalorian\" (2019) are influenced by Greek and Corinthian styles. Using artifacts from The Wallace Collection, Capwell addresses the realism of flails and maces as seen in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003). And he rates how realistic shields and swords are in \"Vikings\" (2014) and \"The Last Kingdom\" (2015). \n\nIs it possible to reforge swords, as seen in \"Game of Thrones\" (2011)? And how difficult would it be to fight in mud in full armor, like Robert Pattinson and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet do in \"The King\" (2019)? Does knightly combat look anything like \"Excalibur\" (1981), \"El Cid\" (1961), and \"Tale of Tales\" (2015)?\n\nTobias Capwell is an author, lecturer, broadcaster, and the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. He has been a horseman and martial artist since childhood, is a founding member of the modern historical jousting community, and has fought in major international tournaments all over the world. Capwell has written many books and articles on weapons, armor, tournaments, and knighthood, including \"Armour of the English Knight 1400-1450,\" \"Arms and Armour of the Medieval Joust,\" and \"Masterpieces of European Arms and Armour in the Wallace Collection.\" In 2015 he had the honor of serving as one of the two fully armored knights who escorted the remains of King Richard III from the battlefield at Bosworth to their final resting place in Leicester Cathedral.\n\nFind out more about The Wallace Collection here: ",

                    "description": "Former US submarine commander L. David Marquet rated the realism of submarine scenes in popular movies, judging their technological accuracy as well as the depiction of life on board.\n\nMarquet addresses the realism of nuclear crisis movies, such as \"The World Is Not Enough\" and \"K-19: The Widowmaker,\". He also rated the accuracy of standoff scenes in \"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"The Enemy Below\", \"Hunter Killer,\" and \"Crimson Tide.\" He also breaks down the realism of costumes, tactics, and terminology from \"U-571.\"\n\nIs life on board a submarine, including confined conditions and drills, as depicted in \"Das Boot\"? Would Navy SEALs enter a submarine from a HALO drop similar to \"Act of Valor\", and is it possible for a submarine to hear music from the water's surface, like in  \"The Wolf's Call\"? Can holes on a submarine be plugged with pins and other metal objects, as we see in \"The Simpsons\"? Would nuclear missiles be triggered by dislodging in a ship interior, such as in \"Aquaman\"?\n\nMarquet graduated top of his class from the US Naval Academy and served for 28 years on submarines, including as an engineer officer aboard the USS Will Rogers, then as captain on the USS Olympia and the USS Santa Fe. Having retired in 2009, he is now a Wall Street Journal best-selling author of \"Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders.\"\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

He turned to bank robbery after threats to his family by a Mexican cartel. He was nicknamed the \"kangaroo bandit,\" having been captured on CCTV stuffing cash into a backpack worn on his chest. He says he robbed over 100 banks across California between 1999 and 2001. He eventually turned himself in and served nine years in prison after pleading guilty to six robberies. He now works as a life coach and motivational speaker, helping newly released prisoners reintegrate into society. He's also a partner in two production companies. \n\nAnyone who has been affected by violent crime can contact the National Center for Victims of Crime on 1 (202) 467-8700 or ",

Doctor Wagner, a real life emergency physician Big Mouth reaction / real doctor reacts to hilarious Big Mouth funny moments, BIG MOUTH characters, mysterious illness, and injuries. Real doctor watches the funniest Big Mouth moments and Big Mouth best moments and tells us what is accurate and what is not in these big mouth clips from Netflix.\n\nBig Mouth is an American adult animated coming-of-age sitcom created by Andrew Goldberg, Nick Kroll, Mark Levin, and Jennifer Flackett for Netflix. Big Mouth explores puberty while embracing a frankness about the human body and sex with characters Jay Bilzerian, Nick Kroll, Missy Foreman-Greenwald, Andrew Glouberman, Jessi Glaser, Maury, Connie, and Matthew MacDell, but the accuracy of these Big Mouth clips is questionable, to say the least. After ER Doctor Jordan Wagner reacted to Big Mouth a while back and the Big Mouth season 5 trailer was released, he got a lot of requests to make a part 2. So today Doctor Wagner, a real life emergency physician from Experts React on Gamology will be watching and reacting to Big Mouth funny moments and Big Mouth best ever clips. Some of the Big Mouth best moments from The Shane Lizard Rises, The New Me, Four Stories About Hand Stuff, and The Planned Parenthood Show. Do you watch Big Mouth full episodes? If you want Dr. Jordan Wagner to continue making this doctor reaction series please give this video a like and leave a comment on which TV show or medical memes or just funny memes you'd like for him to review next.\n\nEven for a cartoon character, going through puberty isn't easy for a young person. Andrew is learning that first hand as he experiences the nightmare that is growing up in this animated series geared toward adults. Along for the ride are friends Nick and Jessi, who develop a budding romance along the way. The comedy veterans who lend their voices to \"Big Mouth\" include John Mulaney, Nick Kroll, Maya Rudolph and Jordan Peele.\n\nOTHER DOCTOR REACTION VIDEOS & BIG MOUTH VIDEOS:\n\n@Doctor Mike - Doctor Reacts To Try Guys | Zach's Mysterious Illness",
