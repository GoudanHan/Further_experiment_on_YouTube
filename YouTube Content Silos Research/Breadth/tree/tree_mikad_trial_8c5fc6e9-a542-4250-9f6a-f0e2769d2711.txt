                    "description": "Recorded on July 18, 2019.\n\n What did Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin want at the beginning of the Second World War? Peter Robinson starts the discussion by why the \u201cbig three\u201d came together as allies in response to Operation Barbarossa during the war. What did the leaders of the \u201cgrand alliance\u201d of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union want? What were their national interests?\n\nRobinson asks Roberts if Churchill aimed to preserve the British Empire. Roberts explains that Churchill\u2019s interests were just in national survival. As Britain was under the threat of massive invasion from Germany, he wanted to make sure that the Russians stayed in the war until the Germans were wiped out completely. Roberts also notes that Churchill wanted Russia to ensure that the Americans, when they did finally enter the war in December 1941, were guided toward a Mediterranean strategy.\n\nKennedy discusses Roosevelt\u2019s motive for joining into an alliance in the aftermath of Operation Barbarossa, before officially entering the war. Kennedy says that Roosevelt wanted to make the world safe for the democratic practices and institutions that had already been established, but he did not seek to expand democracy throughout the world. Next, Robinson asks Kotkin about Stalin\u2019s aim for allying with Britain and United States as well as why Stalin did not quickly respond to Hitler\u2019s actions in Soviet Union despite having one of the biggest armies in the world. Kotkin replies that there was misinformation that made Stalin think that Hitler would not actually attack, that Hitler was only amassing the troops to blackmail Stalin into giving up Ukraine and other territories without actually having to fight. Lastly, Kotkin explains, Stalin also joined the grand alliance for national survival. \n\nRobinson then continues the discussion with Roberts, Kennedy, and Kotkin by asking how things turned out for the three allies after the war. They examine who won and who lost over both the short term and the long term, as well as how the postwar world set the stage for the emergence of new strong powers, particularly China. \n\nThis event addresses these and many other important lessons and questions: \n\u2022 What happens when an international system that is supposed to keep the peace among nations breaks down?\n\u2022 How do nations deal with the breakdown and rebuilding of international order?\n\u2022 How can Western civilization remain strong?\n\u2022 What are the defense resources required to protect free countries from unpleasant predators in the world?\n\n\nFor further information: ",

How was the gold in our jewelry, the carbon in our bodies, and the iron in our cars made? In this lecture, we will trace the origin of a gold atom from the Big Bang to the present day, and beyond. You will learn how the elements were forged in the nuclear furnaces inside stars, and how, when they die, these massive stars spread the elements into space. You will learn about the origin of the building blocks of matter in the Big Bang, and we will speculate on the future of the atoms around us today.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Edward Murphy, University of Virginia\nDate: November 13, 2012\n\nYou can download a copy of the Table of Elements from this page: ",

He is the author of nine works of history, including the first two volumes of his planned three-volume history of Russian power and Joseph Stalin, Paradoxes of Power, 1878\u20131928 and Waiting for Hitler, 1929\u20131941. The premise of this show is simple: Peter Robinson poses five questions to Dr. Kotkin: what Xi Jinping, the president of China believes; what Vladimir Putin believes; whether nuclear weapons are a deterrent in the 21st century; the chances of another American renewal; and Kotkin\u2019s rational basis for loving the United States. It\u2019s a fascinating conversation that delves deep into one of the country\u2019s brightest minds. \n\nFor further information: ",

                "description": "Recorded on February 27, 2017\n\nIn the latest episode from Uncommon Knowledge, Sir Roger Scruton, a formally trained political philosopher, talks about his life and the events he\u2019s witnessed that led him to conservatism. He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain.\n \nSir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didn\u2019t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics.\n \nRobinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the \u201cindigenous working classes\u201d who made their voices known through their votes.\n \nAbout the Guest: Sir Roger Scruton\nSir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his \u201cservices to philosophy, teaching and public education.\u201d\n \n \nAdditional Resources:\n \nBrexit:",

We\u0393\u00c7\u00d6re going to examine the bizarre histories of professional hockey players and look into the peculiar childhood of Bill Gates and spend time in a Chinese rice paddy.

Poverty in America, he says, compared to the rest of the world, is not severe.  Many poor people in poverty in the United States have one or two cars, central heating, and cell phones. The real problem for the poor is the destruction of the family, which Sowell argues dramatically increased once welfare policies were introduced in the 1960s.",

                "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018\n\nThomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.\n\nSowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.\n\nSowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).\n\nRobinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.\n\nInterested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on February 27, 2017\n\nIn the latest episode from Uncommon Knowledge, Sir Roger Scruton, a formally trained political philosopher, talks about his life and the events he\u2019s witnessed that led him to conservatism. He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain.\n \nSir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didn\u2019t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics.\n \nRobinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the \u201cindigenous working classes\u201d who made their voices known through their votes.\n \nAbout the Guest: Sir Roger Scruton\nSir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his \u201cservices to philosophy, teaching and public education.\u201d\n \n \nAdditional Resources:\n \nBrexit:",

                    "description": "In his new essay for the New York-based Foreign Affairs magazine,  Mearsheimer argues that the US and China are locked in a dangerous security competition, more perilous than the first Cold War. In essence, once China grew wealthy, a US-China cold war was inevitable. Had US policymakers understood this logic in the early 1990s, they would have tried to slow down Chinese growth and maximise the power gap between Beijing and Washington.\n\nHowever, the US did the opposite: it pursued a policy of engagement, which aimed to help China grow wealthier \u2013 based on the assumption that China would become a democracy and a responsible stakeholder, which would lead to a more peaceful world. Instead of fostering harmonious relations between China and the US, engagement led to an intense rivalry.\n\nIs Australia and the world in deep trouble? Absent a major internal Chinese crisis, Washington and Beijing are consigned to waging a dangerous security competition. Can we manage on the margins to prevent disaster?\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is professor of political science and international relations at the University of Chicago and author of The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001). He was a guest at the Centre for Independent Studies in 2019. \n\nHost: Tom Switzer is executive director of the Centre for Independent Studies. \n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nCIS promotes free choice and individual liberty and the open exchange of ideas.

He identifies the varieties, the reasons, and the potential costs and benefits, arguing that leaders often lie for good strategic reasons, while distinguishing between lying to another state and lying to one's own people.\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is also the co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago and has written extensively about security issues and international politics.\n\nThe World Beyond the Headlines is a project of the Center for International Studies, which brings scholars, journalists, and world leaders to the University to discuss issues of current global importance. \n\nFor more information on this event, visit ",

Every spring the pond reawakens with new life and beauty, and every year the UChicago community returns to visit the scenic corner of campus. \n\nThe historic Botany Pond was created as an outdoor research laboratory at the turn of the 20th century by John Merle Coulter, chair of the Department of Botany. In 2004\u2014with funding from the Julie and Parker Hall Botanic Garden Endowment Fund\u2014it underwent a major restoration, allowing it to remain a source of academic study, inspiration, and serenity for the UChicago community. \n\nBotany Pond remains a beloved campus space, enjoyed for its biodiversity that includes water lilies, ginko and akebia trees, turtles, fish, ducks\u2014and even the occasional heron.

A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

Home to just 5 percent of the world's total population, the United States houses more than 20 percent of the world's prisoners. In the last three decades, fueled in large part by a national drug policy and legislation like three strikes laws, America has imprisoned more people in local jails, federal penitentiaries, and private correctional facilities than Stalin put in the Gulags. New court rulings have declared overcrowded prisons to be unconstitutional, and the sheer cost of incarceration is forcing prisons to let prisoners back out on the streets.\n\nVICE News was granted rare access to go inside one of the most maximum-security prisons in the country, a place that's on the frontline of what could be a sea change in prison policy. Salinas Valley State Prison is home to America's most powerful prison gangs including the Aryan Brotherhood and Mexican Mafia. It's a place that's projected to have more than 700 assaults this year. In an institution that houses the worst of the worst, we see how one maverick warden is trying to turn the system around by rehabilitating murderers before they get returned to the streets.\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: ",

The officers patrolling the road seized 18 tons of drugs last year \u2014 a more than a 300-percent increase from the year before.\n\n\u201cIt's a traditional route for drug traffickers - not just for drugs, but also heavy arms,\u201d Alcino Galvao da Silva, Unit Leader of the Federal Highway Patrol, told VICE News. \u201cMachine guns, bullets, marijuana, and cocaine\u2026 It has grown quite a bit, especially in Rio de Janeiro.\u201d   \n\n\u201cJohnny,\u201d as he asked VICE News to call him, has been dealing drugs for the Third Command drug gang since he was 16 years-old. Now at 28 he manages all the drugs corners in the neighborhood and isn\u2019t afraid to defend them by force. \n\n\u201cI can tell you that today I've got 35 homicides,\u201d \u201cJohnny\u201d told VICE News. \u201cFear? We don't have fear. That's what we're here for. To kill and die. We'll die, but die fighting. It's our war motto: Die fighting.\u201d\n\nBolsonaros plan to \u201cgive guns to good people,\u201d and ramp up the military\u2019s role by giving security forces more power to shoot and kill armed criminals isn\u2019t getting the drug gangs to drop their guns. Third Command says their stockpilling weapons of war. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to take the world into an urban war,\u201d \u201cJohnny\u201d told VICE News. \u201cInstead of us killing the Red Command we\u2019re going to go after the guy who is in the police who listened to one of Bolsonaro's orders.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: ",

A van pulled up alongside and let loose a burst of gunfire, killing her in a well orchestrated hit.\n\nHer murder was one of approximately 170 that have occurred in the Caribbean nation so far this year, putting it on course for one of the highest murder rates in the world. The country saw only 93 murders in 1999. Last year, there were 407.\n\nVICE News visited the slums of Port of Spain and spoke with police, activists, community leaders, and gangsters to understand the country's decade-plus spike in killings. Many of the murders are attributed to ruthless and politically connected street gangs who control territories that are sometimes no larger than a city block. The gangs fight over lucrative government contracts meant to provide social services and combat unemployment.\n\nBut gang violence is merely a symptom of a bigger problem. Trinidad has become an important stop for drugs headed to West Africa and the United States. Many observers point to \"the big fish\" \u2014 the nameless political and business elites who are behind drug trafficking and the culture of endemic corruption and murder that come with it. They are accused of turning a country rich in oil and gas deposits into their own personal narco-state, fostering impunity through a web of bribes and murders. Unlike the profits from the energy industry, however, this phenomenon trickles all the way down to the street level.\n\nCheck out VICE News' coverage of the situation in Venezuela: ",

                "description": "In the wake of multiple knife-related murders in the UK's capital, activist and ex-gang member Josh Osbourne takes an in-depth look at the \"code of silence\". This is an entrenched mindset that regularly stops young people from going to the authorities, in fear of being labelled a \"snitch\".\n\nBritain's most senior police officer attributes the recent spate of murders to austerity, drug markets, police cuts and social media, yet despite a controversial crack-down targeting drill music videos, the number of deaths keep rising.\n\nJosh follows the grieving families struggling to find justice and answers in their own communities. He speaks to an active gang member about how reputation is a fiercely protected social capital and shame can be a gateway to violence. He learns that surviving a knife attack is no longer seen as a close call, but a badge of honour, and how the consequences of knife crime stretch beyond simply life and death. The film explores how the internet has profoundly altered the way conflicts are instigated and unravel on London's streets, and how the communities affected are reacting to this.\n\nAs London remains in the throes of a knife crime epidemic, VICE takes a look at one of the most important domestic issues of our time.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: ",

And with good reason \u2014 South Africa's 2012-2013 crime statistics were the worst in a decade, with increases in murder, attempted murder, violent armed robbery, and carjackings.\n\nFear of crime has led to a boom in South Africa's private security industry since apartheid ended 20 years ago. The field's quick expansion is largely a result of continued social and economic inequality, increased violence, and inept police forces.\n\nVICE News traveled to South Africa's mother city Cape Town to look at the lifestyle gap between those who can and cannot afford the luxury of safety.\n\nCheck out the VICE News beta for more: ",

Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss. Hosted in the St. Regis Hotel Ballroom, Aspen, Colorado.",

From Call of Duty set-pieces to Predator-hunting mercenaries, it\u2019s a must-have for any larger-than-life action hero, so with its colossal reputation and a history spanning centuries, why do movies and video games keep getting the spinning maw of the Minigun so wrong? (Presented by PUBG MOBILE)\n\nIn this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to discover the surprising origins of the M134 Minigun, and see why it\u2019s one of the least well-represented guns in pop culture history.\n\nYou can check out more episodes of Loadout right here. - ",

The disappearance of MH370 has been described as the \u201cgreatest mystery in the history of aviation\u201c. Despite the efforts of an international investigation team, and millions of dollars spent searching the ocean bottom for the wreckage site, no one has been able to determine what really happened.\n\nIn his new book, veteran Canadian aviation investigator and first-time author, Larry Vance, pieces together what he believes happened to flight 370. For this book, three professional accident investigators, each with decades of real-world experience in crash dynamics, examined the available evidence. Their conclusions form the basis of Vance\u2019s book, entitled, \u201cMH370: Mystery Solved.\u201d\n\nLarry Vance is a professional aircraft accident investigator, and a member of the HVS Aviation Consultancy Group, based in Ottawa, Canada. His background includes 34 years in aircraft accident investigation; 24 of those years with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), and 10 years with HVS Aviation.\n\nWhile with the TSB, he was assigned as investigator-in-charge (IIC) of more than 200 aviation accidents. He was also named as Canadian Accredited Representative for numerous high-profile international investigations. Along with IIC duties, he also participated as a specialist investigator in hundreds of other investigations involving a wide range of aircraft types from small single-engine aircraft to large airline-type aircraft.\n\nWith HVS Aviation, and its predecessor Accident Investigation & Research (AIR), Larry works both domestic and international cases. He is responsible for conducting independent investigations to be used in conflict resolution and litigation.\n\nLarry\u2019s pilot experience involves more than 40 years as an Airline Transport Rated professional pilot, with over 12,000 flight hours on various aircraft types.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!",

                "description": "Aviation experts frequently remind us that flying on modern jet planes is the safest form of transport. However those assertions are meaningless while the fate of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 remains unknown. It\u2019s more than two years since the Boeing 777 disappeared off the face of the earth. An exhaustive and expensive search in the southern Indian Ocean has failed to turn up anything. It\u2019s due to end soon, which has further distressed the grieving families of the 239 passengers and crew who are presumed dead. Frustration at the lack of clues has led to significant reassessment about MH370, and as Ross Coulthart discovers in this 60 Minutes investigation, there\u2019s now growing evidence that authorities have been ignoring more credible theories about what might have brought the jet down.",

Believing America to be a saviour and a life of hope, the \u2018Addergoole 14\u2019 saved fiercely in order to afford a ticket aboard the Titanic and escape to the land of dreams. Told using interviews with the descendants of survivors, these are new perspectives of the conditions on board, and the events of April 12th 1912. Focusing not on the glory and fate of the ship, this new look at a famous tragedy uncovers ordinary lives and fragile hopes of the community that lost more that fateful night than any other.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...
