A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

At least 170 people have been arrested as part of the convoy crackdown and Ottawa\u2019s police chief warned their investigation into others involved will continue for many months. David Akin has more from Parliament Hill.\n\nThe streets in Ottawa are starting to look more bare and normal. Sean O\u2019Shea has more from the midst of that police operation.\n\nFrom protesters to police, officers appeared to be shifting strategy today as they work to clear the remaining protesters from the area. The slow methodical approach that we saw from police yesterday seemed to be replaced with a much tougher line today. Mercedes Stephenson has more on the police tactics used today.\n\nTo the escalating tensions in Ukraine and a new show of force from Vladimir Putin. The Russian president oversaw large-scale nuclear drills today. And as Reggie Cecchini reports, it comes as Ukraine\u2019s president issues a desperate plea to western allies. \n\nGeorge Floyd\u2019s murder in the summer of 2020 sparked a global outcry over systemic racial inequality including Black employees in corporate Canada. A new survey sheds light on how their situation is changing. Anne Gaviola reports.\n \nNorthern British Columbia is a world away from Syria, but it\u2019s a place one Syrian refugee is proud to call home. To express his gratitude he\u2019s giving back to his community. Jay Durant has his story.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",

Clinton was convinced that Trump and Russia were connected.\n\nOn October 31 2016, just days before the presidential election, she tweeted: \"Computer scientists have apparently uncovered a covert server linking the Trump Organization to a Russian-based bank.\"\n\nWhich computer scientists? Who were they working for? Durham says they were working for Clinton, and their findings were incorrect.\n\nThere was no collusion between Trump and Russia, but there was still a lot of subterfuge going on, all of it coming from Clinton, Durham says.\n\nTrump says the allegations are the equivalent of treason. \u201cThis is a scandal far greater in scope and magnitude than Watergate and those who were involved in and knew about this spying operation should be subject to criminal prosecution. In a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death.\u201d\n\nThe Durham filing ends years of wishful reporting of the matter by the left-wing media, during which Trump was seen to be a dangerous international diplomat. \n\nBut relations between the US and Russia have degenerated dramatically under Trump\u2019s successor, Joe Biden, to the point where war between the two countries in the near future is plausible.\n\nThe mainstream media continues to show less interest in this potential war than it did with the allegations of Russian collusion. Ironically, Putin now is more likely than at any time during the Trump presidency to get what he wants.",

But he said they have Ukraine to thank for standing up to Russian aggression for years, and protecting the rest of Europe from it.\nStill, Zelenskyy said diplomacy is the only means for Ukraine to regain the territory it lost when Russia attacked in 2014. That led him to question Russian claims that they are not seeking to do so again now.\nChristiane Amanpour was on hand to conduct an in-depth follow-up interview with Zelenskyy.\n\n\nSubscribe: ",

Trudeau invoked measures to give his govt more power to respond to ongoing anti-govt trucker protests. Emergencies Act allows the federal govt to take 'special temporary measures' for 30 days during national emergencies. Trudeau has invoked the Emergencies Act to quell the protests by truckers. The Canadian government is being urged to do more to disperse protests which have led to incidents of harassment and violence in Ottawa.",

What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?\n\nHuge thanks to:\nProf. Konstantin Batygin, Caltech\nProf. David Jewitt, UCLA\n\nI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nAlfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige Thorman\n\nMusic from ",

If you hit a tennis ball with a racket, a wave has to travel from the strings to your hand before you feel it - and the ball is well on its way to the net by this time. If you hit a golf ball, the ball is well on its way to the hole before you can feel it. Rigid bodies aren't truly rigid and understanding this is essential to understanding the way the world works",

                    "description": "Light is so common that we rarely think about what it really is. But just over two hundred years ago, a groundbreaking experiment answered the question that had occupied physicists for centuries. Is light made up of waves or particles?\n\nThe experiment was conducted by Thomas Young and is known as Young's Double Slit Experiment. This famous experiment is actually a simplification of a series of experiments on light conducted by Young. In a completely darkened room, Young allowed a thin beam of sunlight to pass through an aperture on his window and onto two narrow, closely spaced openings (the double slit). This sunlight then cast a shadow onto the wall behind the apparatus. Young found that the light diffracted as it passed through the slits, and then interfered with itself, created a series of light and dark spots. Since the sunlight consists of all colours of the rainbow, these colours were also visible in the projected spots. Young concluded that light consist of waves and not particles since only waves were known to diffract and interfere in exactly the manner that light did in his experiment.\n\nThe way I have always seen this experiment performed is with a laser and a manufactured double slit but since the experiment was conducted in 1801 I have always thought that it should be possible to recreate the experiment using sunlight and household materials. That is basically what I did here. I will show the interference pattern I observed with my homemade double slit on 2Veritasium but I chose to use a manufactured double slit here to ensure that the pattern was impressive for observers at the beach.\n\nSpecial thanks to Henry, Brady, and Rupert for their cameos, Glen for filming and Josh for helping create the apparatus. Thanks also to the Royal Society for allowing us to view the original manuscript of Young's lecture and the University of Sydney for lending the double slits.\n\nMusic by Kevin Mcleod (incompetech.com) Danse Macabre, Scissors",
