The division into East and West Germany reflected the division of the world into two during the Cold War. The East-West conflict was to last over 40 years.\n\nFrom today's point of view, what happened back then seems logical. Today we also know that the German-German divide lasted a long time, but it was not irreversible. And it seems almost inevitable that the democratic values of the West German constitution 1949 would prevail as the basis of society - including in the reunified Germany. But the Germans in 1949 couldn't even have guessed at all this. They were experiencing an unprecedented historical experiment in both East and West. It was a radically new situation: What if they made fundamental mistakes in the founding of their states? What if they were unable to overcome the curse of fascism? The documentary not only reconstructs the major events surrounding the founding of the two states in 1949, but also attitudes to life at the time. We meet contemporary witnesses from both countries who talk about embarking on a political and social journey, the course and destination of which were still quite open at that time.\n_______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Thousands of KGB or CIA, agents observed each other, cogs in the biggest information war in history.\n\nBut the war between the secret services was one dimension of a much larger conflict. A confrontation that almost boiled over just under the surface of the cold war. Economic pressures, secret diplomacy and espionage were the hallmarks of this hidden war that never turn into armed conflict. An underground war between two institutions, without the knowledge of official diplomacy.\n\nWe hear from former CIA and KGB agents and discover the hidden face of the cold war.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

                "description": "How bad graphic design changed award shows, elections, and your medicine cabinet.\n\nThe 2017 Oscars ended with a pretty shocking mix-up. Announcer Warren Beatty incorrectly named La La Land as the Best Picture winner, and the mistake wasn't revealed until crew members had already started giving their acceptance speeches. A lot of things went wrong for the snafu to happen the way it did. But what if typography was one of them? A better announcement card design could have made for a very different Academy Awards show \u2014 not to mention a much less embarrassing Miss Universe show for Steve Harvey back in 2015. But the implications of bad typography don't end there: poorly designed ballots in the 2000 presidential election arguably could have swayed the outcome, and illegible type on medicine bottles could be causing nearly 500,000 cases of drug misuse per year in the U.S. \n\nSubscribe to our channel!

                    "description": "Fast fashion has radically transformed the textile industry. These days, 56 million tons of clothing are sold every year. But cheap garments come at a high price: A precarious existence for workers and a catastrophic environmental impact.\n\nThe clothing industry is currently deluging the planet with garments. With 100 billion items produced every year, that\u2019s more than ever before. International companies are locked in an ongoing race to create new styles and win higher profits.  And this gigantic expansion is set to continue: The sector is forecast to grow by 60 per cent by 2030. \n\nOn the one hand, fast fashion means affordable clothes for all. Zara is known as the original fast fashion brand. The Spanish clothing giant creates 65,000 new styles every year.\n\nShopping for clothes has become a veritable leisure activity stoked by social media: half of all Instagram posts are related to fashion and beauty. This is how market leaders in fast fashion influence their customers\u2019 buying behavior, backed by relevant neuromarketing specialists. \n\nFast fashion profits from e-commerce. No more trying on clothes in the store, the customer orders online and has the garment delivered - and if they don\u2019t like it, they just send it back. Throwaway clothes and throwaway work: carried out by an army of couriers within the precarious gig economy.\n\nThe textile industry is the sector with the world\u2019s second-highest environmental price tag. Fast fashion manufacturers\u2019 favorite material - viscose made from wood fibers - is marketed as a climate-friendly alternative. But producing this fabric uses a whole range of chemicals. This leads to serious health issues, not only for those working in the factories, but also for people living close by, for example in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. \n\nEvery year in Europe, four million tons of clothing ends up in the trash. Less than one per cent of this is recycled. The fashion industry likes to parade its sustainability credentials, but the reality is quite the opposite.",

Go!\u201d someone shouted as the rioters, some in military gear, streamed in. It was the start of the most serious attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. The mob coursed through the building, enraged that Congress was preparing to make Trump\u2019s electoral defeat official. \u201cDrag them out! \u2026 Hang them out!\u201d rioters yelled at one point, as they gathered near the House chamber.\n\nOfficials in the House and Senate secured the doors of their respective chambers, but lawmakers were soon forced to retreat to undisclosed locations. Five people died on the grounds that day, including a Capitol police officer. In all, more than 50 officers were injured.\n\nTo reconstruct the pandemonium inside the Capitol, The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and hundreds of videos, some of which were exclusively obtained. By synchronizing the footage and locating some of the camera angles within a digital 3-D model of the building, The Post was able to map the rioters\u2019 movements and assess how close they came to lawmakers \u2014 in some cases feet apart or separated only by a handful of vastly outnumbered police officers.

In response the Ukrainian military alongside its paramilitary proxies have been working to secure towns across Donetsk to ensure a safe election took place.\n\nOn Sunday morning as voting started across the country, Donetsk itself saw no voting take place so VICE News headed out to Krasnoarmiisk where voting was able to take place, under the watchful eye of local loyal-to-Kiev police and another paramilitary force, the Dinipro Battalion.\n\nBack in Donetsk, supporters of the DPR held a rally in the square, denouncing the election and the other DPR bugbears, NATO, the Kiev 'junta' and the US. Despite the threats, the election did take place in a few towns across the region and the fact that it took place at all seemingly threatens the advertised control of the region by the DPR.\n\nWatch all of VICE News' coverage of the conflict in Ukraine here: ",

Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.\n\nDirected by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?\n\nFind out more: ",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",
