That\u2019s the reported price Prince Andrew will pay Virginia Guiffre to settle a very disturbing legal case against him. She says when she was 17 she was trafficked to the Prince by the paedophile businessman Jeffrey Epstein, ably assisted by his sex-offender partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Despite that photo, Andrew denies ever meeting, let alone having sex with Ms Guiffre, but he\u2019s been so discredited, these days it\u2019s difficult to believe anything the disgraced royal says.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

A passenger aircraft so advanced that the chance of it falling out of the sky is unthinkable. But on a stormy June night in 2009 that's just what happened to an Air France A330. Its terrifying descent into the Atlantic Ocean took just four minutes. For three years, what happened inside the cockpit remained a mystery. But as you'll see now, the black box tapes have revealed a shocking and scary scenario of how quickly and easily a high tech passenger plane can crash.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

He identifies the varieties, the reasons, and the potential costs and benefits, arguing that leaders often lie for good strategic reasons, while distinguishing between lying to another state and lying to one's own people.\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is also the co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago and has written extensively about security issues and international politics.\n\nThe World Beyond the Headlines is a project of the Center for International Studies, which brings scholars, journalists, and world leaders to the University to discuss issues of current global importance. \n\nFor more information on this event, visit ",

Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss. Hosted in the St. Regis Hotel Ballroom, Aspen, Colorado.",

And yet, we are wiping out the very animals we should celebrate; we are the flood coming for Noah's Ark. Carl leaves us with a difficult question: Do we have what it takes to let life on earth survive?\n\nCarl Safina\u2019s work has been recognized with MacArthur, Pew, and Guggenheim Fellowships, and his writing has won the Lannan Literary Award and the John Burroughs, James Beard, and George Rabb medals. He has a PhD in ecology from Rutgers University. Safina is the inaugural endowed professor for nature and humanity at Stony Brook University, where he co-chairs the steering committee of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and is founding president of the not-for-profit Safina Center. He hosted the 10-part PBS series Saving the Ocean with Carl Safina. His writing appears in The New York Times, National Geographic, Audubon and other periodicals, and on the Web at National Geographic News and Views, Huffington Post, and CNN.com. Carl Safina\u2019s writing shows how humanity is changing the natural world and what those changes mean for wildlife and for people.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
