That subsidy was introduced in the 1960's to prop-up an American way of farming intended to save India from famine... but decades later, those techniques are destroying farmers\u2019 health, finances, and land. We explore why protesting farmers can\u2019t afford to quit a system that\u2019s failed them for generations.  \n\nHelp keep VICE News\u2019 fearless reporting free for millions by making a one time or ongoing contribution here. - ",

Uh oh. Why did I do this\n\nI've gotta change my avatar I actually really don't like bananas. Maybe I hate them because of this game. Or maybe it's because one time I ate some rotten pizza and it tasted just enough like banana that I gag. Lol I wrote all all of this and you read it. The internet is a miracle.\n\nPatreon: ",

Did Lovecraft write some pretty incredible horror? Sure! Was he also a raging xenophobe? Absolutely! Are his perspectives on life connected with the stories he felt compelled to tell? Duh! If you look at Lovecraft's writing through the lens of his life, clear patterns emerge that allow us to pin down what exactly he built his horror cosmology out of. It's an invaluable analytical tool that allows us to take apart his writings by getting inside his head.

Oliver Cromwell, the English Puritan turned military dictator, is today most famous for signing the death warrant that led to Charles I\u2019s bloody execution in 1649. Over a hundred years before the American and French Revolutions shook the globe, this smalltime farmer from the British sticks proved with steel that the divine right of kings was not so holy after all. \n\nNOTE: This is a re-issue, we had an error on the original video that required we do a re-upload.

Despite having incredibly uncontroversial content, she's managed to find herself on the political TikTok battlefield every couple of months for the last three years. It began with simple complaints about hate comments, and has since escalated to the point where OnlyJayus cannot even make a simple joke without being cancelled, along the way having beefed with creators like Acrello, AuntKaren0, PapaGut, and TheJonathanMoss. This video will cover that transition, and in the process, explain how OnlyJayus became TikTok's most hated creator.\n\nThis is, How OnlyJayus Became TikTok\u2019s Most Hated Creator.\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2 XO \u2764\n\nThis video was heavily inspired by Bills \"The Downfall Of OnlyJayus: The Most Hated Content Creator On TikTok!\", big thanks to him, you can watch his version here: ",

                    "description": "This documentary provides a rare glimpse of change in the notoriously closed country. Filmmakers Gregor M\u00f6llers and Anne Lewald discretely shot the video on trips to North Korea in 2013 and 2017, when they were not allowed autonomy or spontaneity.\n\nDespite the fact that their itinerary was arranged for them in advance and guides chaperoned them everywhere, the two Berliners found a way to register their impressions. They depict a city lacking authenticity, a country longing for reunification and a people shaped by Juche beliefs and socialist propaganda. In a society steeped in obfuscation and spectacle, where deception is necessary for perception and expression, the filmmakers were forced to play a double role, secretly recording without permission while also genuinely relating to their hosts. By blending travelogue and espionage, A Postcard from Pyongyang captures what happens when you rely solely on what you see, not what you\u2019re told, and reveals a reality Kim Jong-Un\u2019s regime doesn\u2019t want foreigners to see.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

                    "description": "This summer marks the centennial of the outbreak of World War I, perhaps the most transformative war in history. While the wars of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars harnessed national populations to the war effort in a way not previously seen since the emergence of the modern states system, WWI combined the mobilization of both populations and industrial power, enhanced by technology, to produce a most lethal form of warfare. WWI also redrew the map of Europe and created the modern Middle East, as it led to the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire, thereby unleashing nationalism the disruptive characteristics of which still plague us today. It also paved the way for the great ideological conflicts of the 20th century by unleashing the forces of state-based communism and fascism. To commemorate the outbreak of The Great War, FPRI and ROA will present a workshop offering presentations by three eminent scholars of the war. Michael Neiberg of the US Army War College will discuss the factors that led to the outbreak of the war. John Schindler of the US Naval War College will discuss the often overlooked role of Austria-Hungary in the war and the Eastern and Italian fronts. Kate Epstein of Rutgers University-Camden will discuss the role of pre-war British defense policy in the outbreak of the conflict. Mac Owens, editor of Orbis and professor at the Naval War College, will moderate the panel.",
