Craig is one of the world\u2019s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the \u201cnew atheism\u201d movement. \n\nIn front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christ\u2019s resurrection. It was a compelling clash of worldviews and an examination of the major arguments for and against Christianity and atheism.",

Fry was joined on stage at the Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall by Richard Dawkins and the two discussed Hitch's unflinching commitment to the truth. \n\nHollywood actor Sean Penn was beamed in from LA by Google+ and, between cigarette puffs, read from Hitch's acclaimed work, The Trial of Henry Kissinger. Five friends of Hitch spoke via satellite in New York: satirist Christopher Buckley and editor Lewis Lapham mused on Hitch's prowess as a journalist. 'Like a pot of gold', said Lapham. Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie and James Fenton delighted the audience with stories of Hitchens as a young man. Rushdie drew roars of laughter when he recounted a word game invented by Amis and Hitchens where the word 'love' is replaced with 'hysterical sex'. Particular favourites included Hysterical Sex in the Time of Cholera and Hysterical Sex Is All You Need.\n\nWatching the event with Hitch at his bedside in Texas, Hitch's wife Carol and novelist Ian McEwan provided an email commentary. 'His Rolls Royce mind is still purring beautifully', typed McEwan.\n\nThe event was watched live by 2500 at the venue, and by thousands more in UK cinemas and online.",

I realize it's a mouthful, so today I decided to react to a couple videos Zach as posted on the Try Guys channel as well as back on the Buzzfeed channel about his medical journey dealing with chronic pain, his experience with the medical system, and the reality of living with the disease to this day. We also discuss inflammation, Scoliosis, MRIs, Humira, physical therapy, Are there any other Try Guys videos you'd like me to react to? Let me know down in the comments if Ned, Eugene, Keith, or Zach has done anything else you'd like me to talk about!\n\nI LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there\u2019s a subject you want me to discuss or something you\u2019d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below.

He is currently a Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the New School University in New York City. He wrote Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism and founded www.democracyatwork.info, a non-profit advocacy organization of the same name that promotes democratic workplaces as a key path to a stronger, democratic economic system.\n\nProfessor Wolff discusses the economic dimensions of our lives, our jobs, our incomes, our debts, those of our children, and those looming down the road in his unique mixture of deep insight and dry humor. He presents current events and draws connections to the past to highlight the machinations of our global economy. He helps us to understand political and corporate policy, organization of labor, the distribution of goods and services, and challenges us to question some of the deepest foundations of our society.

Dr. Zizek is a Slovenian philosopher and professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, whose works on cultural studies, psychoanalysis and, above all, for the purposes of our debate, Marxism, are world-renowned. The topic? Happiness: Marxism vs Capitalism. This is the official video. Many bootlegs have already been released, but that seems inevitable given our current state of technological capability. \n\nI started with a critique of The Communist Manifesto, which is the central revolutionary document of the Marxist movement (rather than addressing, say, Zizek's work, which wasn't what the debate was about). \n\nIt wasn't so obvious for the rest of the discussion that Marxism, per se, comprised the central topic of discussion.\n\nWatch for yourself.\n\nA good article, I think, on Zizek: ",

In this video, I cover the world record progression of the any% speedrunning category in Majora's Mask from its release to the present day. \n\nThis is my first ever scripted video, so I'm hoping it's acceptable! I started working on this in early 2018, but I procrastinated until now. It turns out that was the right decision, though, since a lot happened in this game in the past year.\n\nI plan on making many more videos like this that go more in-depth on lots of Majora's Mask topics, from how glitches work, to thought experiments (hOW maNy RUpeeS Do YOu NeeD to beAT tHe GAMe), as well as other stuff I probably haven't thought of yet. Let me know if you have any ideas for things you want me to cover!\n\nCorrections:\n-Gigopler's name should have been capitalized in the credits (sorry, Gigo, not rerendering the whole thing for that)\n\n-I implied that sva had the record in January 2014 for \"12 hours,\" but I don't actually know how long it was. Not sure why I said 12 hours. Definitely less than a day, but also definitely longer than Trev had the record in 2017, so 12 hours is probably a decent guess.\n\n-The info at ",

It should not be considered extremely detailed or comprehensive - going through all of the contributions and discoveries would take too long and wouldn't flow particularly well. However, I cover all of the major discoveries and provide simplified explanations of the technical glitches. I also cover some of the more obscure but interesting details.\n\nThe video was somewhat rushed near the end of production and I didn't polish it as much as I would like. Hopefully you will enjoy it anyway, there are just some minor issues and editing errors (documented below). I will aim to improve my quality for future videos (this one is definitely a step up from my previous video).\n\n\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c:\n\nI referred to Mitjitsu as \"Mitijitsu\" at multiple places in the video. I wrote his name slightly wrong in the script and failed to double check - sorry about that! \n\nAt ",
