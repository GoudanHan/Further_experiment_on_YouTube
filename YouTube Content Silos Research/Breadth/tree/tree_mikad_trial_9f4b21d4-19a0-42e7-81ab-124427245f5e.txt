                    "description": "Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market \u2013 the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? \n\nFor years, the world\u2019s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.\n\nThe fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it\u2019s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: \"This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more.\" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it\u2019s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It\u2019s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates.\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

                    "description": "A global shortage of microchips is devastating the auto industry. Carmakers are forced to sell cars without features like heated seats, considered essential in colder climates. General Motors has been directing the supplies it does have to its most profitable vehicles. And there isn\u2019t really a clear end to this in sight.\n\nGeneral Motors had to temporarily drop heated seats as an option on vehicles in response to the chip shortage. But the largest U.S. automaker is not alone. The move is another sign of how automakers are having to respond to a crisis that has been cratering dealer inventory, spiking prices and delaying orders.\n\nWhile GM does have a proposed remedy in place \u2014 a retrofit option will be available for owners later in 2022 \u2014 there really is no discernible end of the chip shortage in sight. There has been talk of trying to spur more domestic semiconductor production, but that will take years and billions of dollars to get off the ground.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

                "description": "In 2021, inflation rose at a rate not seen in more than three decades. Congress gave the Federal Reserve a mandate to maintain stable prices. The bank, with its power to lend and set interest rates, is getting a test in the form of a snarled supply chain and a world continuing to recover from the pandemic. As a result, economists across the spectrum wonder if the Fed can control this bout of price spikes.\n\nHeading into 2022, the Federal Reserve is stuck in a game of chicken with the U.S. economy. Sectors such as energy and autos are hitting double-digit inflation rates, which are piling costs on for consumers.\n\nThe central bank first said the eye-popping inflation figures reported in late 2021 are \u201ctransitory,\u201d although it is now dropping that word from the messaging. Earlier in the year, the global supply chain was brought to its knees as traffic jams piled up along trade routes. Meanwhile, early retirements picked up and younger workers started to quit their jobs at the fastest pace on record.\n\nLawrence Mishel, a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute, says, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reasons to think that inflation is transitory. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be two months, it could be a year, but it\u2019s not going to be, you know, 4 or 5% a year for the next five years.\u201d\n\nLeaders at the Fed have a long-term target of about 2% inflation. They believe that this rate could produce a healthy and stable economy. But shrinking union membership and the expansion of global trade may have made that difficult to achieve. As a result, the central bank is taking a stance that will invite slightly higher levels of inflation for longer periods of time.\n\nCritics say the Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to policy is flawed because the underlying models are broken. \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty darn obvious that the Fed cannot control inflation on the downside, or the upside, given the current experience,\u201d says Danielle DiMartino Booth of Quill Intelligence. \n\nThe central bank can influence some sources of inflation, such as wages or the housing market. But if they\u2019re coming from areas beyond the Fed\u2019s reach, its policies won\u2019t necessarily be effective.\n\nCorrection (November 17,2021): At ",

The curve has helped predict every recession over the past 50 years. That means the curve accurately predicted even largely unforeseen downturns like the dot-com bubble of 2001 and the Great Recession in 2007.\n\nAs a result, news of yield curve inversions can now send markets tumbling. Policymakers keep a close eye on even small changes in the curve\u2019s composition.\n\nSo how did this simple graph showing U.S. Treasury bond interest rates grow into one of the most reliable recession indicators we have? And what does a yield curve inversion really mean?\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

How was the gold in our jewelry, the carbon in our bodies, and the iron in our cars made? In this lecture, we will trace the origin of a gold atom from the Big Bang to the present day, and beyond. You will learn how the elements were forged in the nuclear furnaces inside stars, and how, when they die, these massive stars spread the elements into space. You will learn about the origin of the building blocks of matter in the Big Bang, and we will speculate on the future of the atoms around us today.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Edward Murphy, University of Virginia\nDate: November 13, 2012\n\nYou can download a copy of the Table of Elements from this page: ",

                "description": "Governments don\u2019t work the way most people think they do. Public choice theory explores why government fails through how voters, politicians, and bureaucrats actually make decisions. Professor Antony Davies explains.\n\nPublic choice economics is a field in economics in which we take what we understand about how humans behave, which is normally applied to humans in the private sector, and we apply this knowledge to humans in the public sector. What emerges is an interesting dichotomy between how we imagine government works and how it actually works.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\nFor a full transcript please visit:  ",

This Prof. shows how high taxes actually made America less equal. \n\nWe always hear that the rich should pay taxes more, that our tax rates aren\u2019t high enough. If only we raise taxes we can solve a lot of our problems \u2014 inequality would go down and maybe we\u2019d even have more economic growth. Now the funny thing about this view is it really doesn\u2019t comport with our historical experience at all.\n\nLEARN MORE: \nThe Myth of Equality in the 1950s (video): Another myth of the 1950s is that there was economic equality. Prof. Brian Domitrovic explains why this is a myth. ",

            "description": "Professor Antony Davies explains the many miss-understandings about Government Debt. Myth 1 is that the government owes \u201conly\u201d $20 trillion. (In reality, it\u2019s much more.) But luckily, Myth 10 is that there\u2019s no way to fix this problem\u2026 \n\nMyth number one, the government owes $20 trillion. How much is $20 trillion? Suppose you go to Germany, and in Germany, you go to every town. In every town, you visit every store. In every store, you look at every shelf and grab everything that is for sale. The amount of money you spend will not be $20 trillion. If you go to Germany and then to France and you go to every town, and within every town, you go to every store. In every store, you look on every shelf and you buy everything. You still will not have spent $20 trillion. You can go to England and while you\u2019re there, you can go to the North Countries and buy everything that\u2019s for sale, and you still will not have spent $20 trillion. In fact, to spend $20 trillion, you have to go to every country in Europe, visit every town, in every town, go to every store. In every store, look on every shelf and buy everything. And then you will have spent about $20 trillion.\n\nBut the myth is that this is how much money the government owes. It turns out that there\u2019s more, called unfunded obligations. Unfunded obligations is money the Federal Government has promised but which it does not and will not have the money to pay. Largely, this consists of promises of retirement and medical benefits. If you would take the present value of all the future promises of retirement and medical benefits the government has made and subtract from that the amount of money that\u2019s in the government\u2019s Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and then subtract from that the amount of money the Federal Government anticipates collecting under the current law from future Social Security and Medicare taxes, you will still have an amount of money left over that the government does not have.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: ",

Yes, if you believe the man you're about to meet. Richard Godfrey is no crackpot; he's a respected British aerospace engineer and physicist who says he's found the doomed airliner. If he's right, he'll provide desperately needed answers for the families of the 239 passengers and crew who were aboard the Boeing triple-seven when it vanished eight years ago. But knowing where it is isn't the end of the story - Richard also has to convince authorities to resume the search that's already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

                    "description": "A record number of online returns has created a booming $644 billion liquidation market. As supply chain backlogs cause shortages of new goods and Gen Z shoppers demand more sustainable retail options, pain points for one sector of retail are big business for another. \n\nThe nation's only major public liquidator, Liquidity Services, resells unclaimed mail, items left at TSA checkpoints, and outdated military vehicles. It also refurbishes highly sought after electronics, from noise-canceling headphones to the machines that make microchips. \n\nCNBC takes you on an exclusive tour inside a Liquidity Services returns warehouse outside Dallas, Texas, where unwanted goods from Amazon and Target are stacked to the ceiling before being resold on Liquidation.com or a variety of other marketplaces.\n\nInside Liquidity Services' 130,000-square-foot warehouse in Garland, Texas, the aisles aren't lined with typical merchandise. Instead, they're stacked with returns from Amazon, Target, Sony, Home Depot, Wayfair and more, all in the process of being liquidated.\n\n\"Liquidators are coming in and they're buying up all of this product in bulk. They're then packaging it, palletizing it and reselling it, either to be resold on a site like eBay or Poshmark, or even to individual consumers. So it's turned into a much bigger portion of the industry than we've ever seen before,\" said Sonia Lapinsky of consulting group AlixPartners.\n\nThe liquidation market has more than doubled since 2008, reaching a whopping $644 billion in 2020, according to data from Colorado State University.\n\n\"A lot of this used to be controlled by the mafia,\" said Zac Rogers, assistant professor of supply chain management at Colorado State University. \"It's a good way to hide money, honestly, because nobody's looking at returns. Especially 40 years ago, no one was looking at returns.\"\n\nBut in 2021, a record 16.6% of all merchandise sold was returned, up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. For online purchases, the average rate of return was even higher, at 20.8%, up from 18% in 2020. Processing a return can cost retailers up to 66% of an item's original price, according to returns solution company Optoro.\n\n\"Everyone's very worried about price increases right now. I would suggest that it's possible part of the inflation is these huge amount of returns, that have to be sold at a loss, is detracting from the profitability that a company normally has, and they have to raise their prices,\" said Tony Sciarrotta, executive director of the Reverse Logistics Association.\n\nThere's also a big environmental cost. Returns that aren't liquidated are often destroyed by being incinerated or sent to landfills. Optoro estimates U.S. returns generate an estimated 16 million metric tons of carbon emissions and create up to 5.8 billion pounds of landfill waste each year.\n\nThis pain point for mainstream retailers is now big business for liquidators. There are now thousands of companies in the booming space. One of them is GoodBuy Gear, which specializes in safely liquidating items for babies and young kids.\n\n\"Buying one used item, it saves 82% of its carbon footprint and consumers are really starting to make smart choices. And so I think that the boom in liquidation is really fueled by consumerism and how it's shifted from new to used,\" said Kristin Langenfeld, CEO and co-founder of GoodBuy Gear.\n\nSustainable shopping options are a growing priority for younger shoppers. \n\n\"The circular economy exists to make sure these items find a home, connect it with a family or a young consumer, and keep it out of the landfill,\" said Bill Angrick, CEO of Liquidity Services. He co-founded the company in 1999 as Liquidation.com, with $100,000 of his savings.\n\n\"My father and I used to pick up used books and recyclable bottles. Fast forward to the start of eBay. My father and I started toying around with that. We realized that a marketplace model can create value for virtually any type of used item,\" Angrick said. \n\nWatch the video for an exclusive tour inside a Liquidity Services warehouse, to see the booming business of processing and reselling excess and unwanted goods on the secondary market.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

                    "description": "Richard D. Wolff is Professor of Economics Emeritus, University of Massachusetts, Amherst where he taught economics from 1973 to 2008. He is currently a Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the New School University in New York City. He wrote Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism and founded www.democracyatwork.info, a non-profit advocacy organization of the same name that promotes democratic workplaces as a key path to a stronger, democratic economic system.\n\nProfessor Wolff discusses the economic dimensions of our lives, our jobs, our incomes, our debts, those of our children, and those looming down the road in his unique mixture of deep insight and dry humor. He presents current events and draws connections to the past to highlight the machinations of our global economy. He helps us to understand political and corporate policy, organization of labor, the distribution of goods and services, and challenges us to question some of the deepest foundations of our society. For more of his lectures, visit the Democracy at Work YouTube channel: ",

For the last hundred years or so, it seemed that one important ingredient for running an economically successful country was a western-style democratic government. All evidence pointed to the idea that capitalist representative democracies made for the best economic outcomes. It turns out that isn't the only way to succeed. In the last 40 years or so, authoritarian capitalism as it's practiced in places like China and Singapore has been working really, really well. John is going to look at these systems and talk about why they work, and he's even going to make a few predictions about the future. Also, thanks for watching this series.

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

Governments can also be democratically elected or manipulate elections, authoritarian systems can be toppled by reforms and revolutions, while democracies can gradually become less free by what we call democratic backsliding.

Inflation occurs when the quantity of money increases faster than the quantity of goods. Why does the money supply increase? Very often, it does so to enable the government to pay its bills without raising taxes. There's only one real cure for inflation. It is a cure that's easy to describe but difficult to apply: The government must reduce spending and print less money. The alternatives are both recession and double-digit inflation.

He is the author of nine works of history, including the first two volumes of his planned three-volume history of Russian power and Joseph Stalin, Paradoxes of Power, 1878\u20131928 and Waiting for Hitler, 1929\u20131941. The premise of this show is simple: Peter Robinson poses five questions to Dr. Kotkin: what Xi Jinping, the president of China believes; what Vladimir Putin believes; whether nuclear weapons are a deterrent in the 21st century; the chances of another American renewal; and Kotkin\u2019s rational basis for loving the United States. It\u2019s a fascinating conversation that delves deep into one of the country\u2019s brightest minds. \n\nFor further information: ",

Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. \n\nSowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. \n\nThey chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. \n\nSowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more. \n\nRelated Resources: \n\n\u2022 Discrimination and Disparities (",

He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.\n\nSowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.\n\nSowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).\n\nRobinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.\n\nInterested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

In this sobering talk, atmospheric scientist Brian Toon explains how even a small nuclear war could destroy all life on earth -- and what we can do to prevent it. A professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Brian Toon investigates the causes of the ozone hole, how volcanic eruptions alter the climate, how ancient Mars had flowing rivers, and the environmental impacts of nuclear war. He contributed to the U.N.\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize for climate change and holds numerous scientific awards, including two NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement. He is an avid woodworker. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

And yet, we are wiping out the very animals we should celebrate; we are the flood coming for Noah's Ark. Carl leaves us with a difficult question: Do we have what it takes to let life on earth survive?\n\nCarl Safina\u2019s work has been recognized with MacArthur, Pew, and Guggenheim Fellowships, and his writing has won the Lannan Literary Award and the John Burroughs, James Beard, and George Rabb medals. He has a PhD in ecology from Rutgers University. Safina is the inaugural endowed professor for nature and humanity at Stony Brook University, where he co-chairs the steering committee of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and is founding president of the not-for-profit Safina Center. He hosted the 10-part PBS series Saving the Ocean with Carl Safina. His writing appears in The New York Times, National Geographic, Audubon and other periodicals, and on the Web at National Geographic News and Views, Huffington Post, and CNN.com. Carl Safina\u2019s writing shows how humanity is changing the natural world and what those changes mean for wildlife and for people.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Its second project, \"Shield\", catalyzed state and federal action to help protect the North American electrical grid from threats due to solar storms and cyber-attack, including a 2019 Presidential Executive Order. Its third, 'America in One Room', organized one of the largest political experiments in U.S. history in an effort to improve the way citizens evaluate candidates for public office, featured on the front page of the New York Times, and was hailed by US President Barack Obama.\n\nHelena operates its projects with a small group of leaders it calls \"Helena Members\". They include Nobel Laureates, Academy Award winners, former CIA Directors, Olympic athletes, NGO leaders, technology entrepreneurs, explorers and more.\n\nOutside of Helena, Sam serves as Social Entrepreneur in Residence at The Boston Consulting Group. In 2014, Sam won the World Schools Debating Championships as a member of the England Debate Team.\n\n This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Nathaniel A. Turner was born and raised in Gary, Indiana.  Despite graduating in the bottom quarter of his high school class from one of the worst and most impoverished school systems in the country, Nate went on to earn several degrees.  Nate holds a Bachelors (Accounting), a Masters (Theology & History), and a Juris Doctorate degree.\nNate is an entrepreneur and has operated a financial services practice for two decades.  Not withstanding his professional accomplishments, Nate's greatest passion is helping children realize what he rarely experienced growing up in Gary: feeling valued as a human being and knowing his life had a purpose.Today, Nate's counsel and advice are included on his blog \"The Raising Supaman Project\", his radio show \"The Road Less Traveled\", and in his books \"Raising Supaman\" and \"Stop The Bus\".  Nate encourages parents, guardians, and the community to raise children to become great world citizens and he challenges us all to maximize our abilities to their fullest potential.  Nate also speaks nationally and contributes to other nationally recognized blogs, publications, and radio programs.Nate believes each day is another opportunity to share valuable experiences, tools, methods, and resources with those charged with preparing the sons and daughters of our Nation.  Nate considers it a calling to make certain that OUR future is ready for this awesome journey called life.

He believes that we all benefit from increasing the everyday possibilities to articulate those feelings that are far too often left internalised. Don\u2019t miss this incredibly personal talk in which Gareth shares his story of his battle with depression during his time as an undergraduate student, how he found the space to talk, and how he recovered from this low point through helping others to find that space too. You can continue the conversation with him on Twitter: @Garethjgriffith Gareth Griffith is an Advanced Quantitative Methods PhD student at the University of Bristol. He is interested in all things Mental Health, Wellbeing, Quantitative Methods and Social Inequality. His research focuses on using advanced statistical methodologies to address inequality in mental health outcomes in the UK, particularly investigating the most effective way to measure and analyse these outcomes. Currently he is working on evaluating the current methodologies and underlying assumptions used in measuring and quantifying mental health responses in the UK. His previous projects include using developing advanced multilevel methodologies to investigate segregation in UK self-rated health, and multilevel analysis of mental health outcomes across the UK in 2009.

But what about when those technologies destroy the environment? In this provocative talk, Time Magazine \u201cHero of the Environment\u201d and energy expert, Michael Shellenberger explains why solar and wind farms require so much land for mining and energy production, and an alternative path to saving both the climate and the natural environment. Michael Shellenberger is a Time Magazine Hero of the Environment and President of Environmental Progress, a research and policy organization. A lifelong environmentalist, Michael changed his mind about nuclear energy and has helped save enough nuclear reactors to prevent an increase in carbon emissions equivalent to adding more than 10 million cars to the road.

It\u2019s when you step out into the unknown that interesting discoveries start to take place. When they do, it\u2019s your responsibility to share the knowledge with society. \n\n\nDestin Sandlin is an aerospace and mechanical engineer from Alabama and the creator of Smarter Every Day, a YouTube channel with over 2 million subscribers and 125 million views. He\u2019s curious about the world and the science behind everyday occurrences. Some of his most popular videos involve investigating helicopter physics, finding butterflies in the Amazon, shooting an AK-47 underwater and dropping cats in weightlessness.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

Woz, as he is almost universally known, designed the hardware, circuit boards and operating system for the Apple I. After a plane crash in 1981, Wozniak played a reduced role at Apple, ending full time employment in 1987. Since then he's been a regular character on the technology scene, founding several tech companies working on remote controls, GPS technology, Lego robots and data storage among other things. He wrote his autobiography, iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon, in 2007 and continues to provide schools in his neighbourhood with funding, technical support and advice. Wozniak is a founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the recipient of the National Medal of Technology, the Heinz Award, and numerous honorary doctorate degrees.",

A great conversation requires a balance between talking and listening. This balance is important because bad communication leads to bad relationships, at home, at work, everywhere.\n\nCeleste Headlee has worked in public radio since 1999, as a reporter, host, and correspondent. She was the Midwest Correspondent for NPR before becoming the co-host of the PRI show The Takeaway. She also guest hosted a number of NPR shows including Tell Me More, Talk of the Nation, Weekend All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition. \n \nCeleste holds multiple degrees in music and still performs as a professional opera singer. She's the granddaughter of composer William Grant Still, the Dean of African American Composers. Celeste is an avid hiker, biker, paddler and dog walker.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

Much of the script-writing was inspired and informed by his wonderful book Sync, and his 2004 TED talk. He is a giant in this field, and has literally written the book on chaos, complexity, and synchronization. It was hard to find a paper in this field that Steven (or one of his students) didn't contribute to. His Podcast \"The Joy of X\" is wonderful \u2014 please listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts ",

This agricultural revolution was a turning point in our history and enabled the existence of civilization. Today, nearly 40% of our planet is farmland. Spread all over the world, these lands are the pieces to a global puzzle we\u2019re all facing: in the future, how can we feed every member of a growing population a healthy diet?
