Gutfeld initially pursued a completely different career path \u2014 one in the world of magazine publishing.\n\nWhen he took on hosting the 3am talk show \u201cRed Eye\u201d on Fox News in 2007, Gutfeld discovered that his particular brand of politically incorrect humor was a hit with audiences. He soon moved on to co-hosting the network\u2019s \u201cThe Five,\u201d and currently hosts \u201cGutfeld!\u201d But how did he get here? From liberal college student to current King of Late Night, this is the untold truth of Greg Gutfeld.",

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice investigate the limits of temperature and a lot more. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn why there\u2019s really no limit of how hot you can make something. On the flip side, we dive into why making things colder is a different story. How do you create a place where there is no heat? You\u2019ll find out more about the Kelvin scale or absolute temperature scale. \n\nNeil takes us through the process of cooling things down. Discover the differences between temperature and heat energy. We explore the vibration of particles and dip our toes into Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution. Then, Neil tells us why we can never philosophically or theoretically reach absolute zero. \n\nTo wrap things up, we investigate what happens when quantum physics take over. Discover more about superfluidity. All that, plus, you\u2019ll hear about the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate and how we can \u201cshape-shift\u201d matter.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: ",

He identifies the varieties, the reasons, and the potential costs and benefits, arguing that leaders often lie for good strategic reasons, while distinguishing between lying to another state and lying to one's own people.\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is also the co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago and has written extensively about security issues and international politics.\n\nThe World Beyond the Headlines is a project of the Center for International Studies, which brings scholars, journalists, and world leaders to the University to discuss issues of current global importance. \n\nFor more information on this event, visit ",

A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

Yes, if you believe the man you're about to meet. Richard Godfrey is no crackpot; he's a respected British aerospace engineer and physicist who says he's found the doomed airliner. If he's right, he'll provide desperately needed answers for the families of the 239 passengers and crew who were aboard the Boeing triple-seven when it vanished eight years ago.

As a headstrong teen determined to become a businessman, \u201cLittle Donald\u201d may grow up taking after his father. Despite his father\u2019s willingness to put Barron in the spotlight, mother Melania insists on her son\u2019s privacy, making young Barron the subject of internet speculation. What we do know is that Trump\u2019s fourteen year-old son lives a life of luxury, enjoys golf and is even considered to be a \u201cLittle Donald\u201d. What we do know about the only child of Donald\u2019s third marriage is he grew up in the Trump Tower penthouse in NYC, where he had an entire floor to himself, and attended an expensive private school. After moving to Washington following his father\u2019s election, Barron became the first son of a president to live in the White House since JFK. Barron is trilingual, speaking his father\u2019s native English, his mother\u2019s native Slovenian, and French, taking on bilingualism as early as age three. The youngest Trump takes after his father with his reportedly stubborn personality, and in his career aspirations. Mother Melania claims he decided at age five that he wanted to pursue a career in business, and his plan B is to become a professional golfer. The teen loves sports, prefers suits over sweatpants, and shares his mother\u2019s interest in upscale fashion. It\u2019s hard to tell what's next for Donald Trump's adolescent son, but it\u2019s likely to include golf.\n\n\nOur Social Media:\nFacebook: ",

                "description": "Getting back was only the beginning as the most spectacular time-travel adventure ever continues in Back to the Future Part II - the sequel that proves that lightning can strike twice! Picking up precisely where they left off, Marty and Doc (Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd) launch themselves to the year 2015 to fine-tune the future and inadvertently disrupt the space time continuum. Now, their only chance to fix the present is by going back to 1955 all over again before it is too late. From the Academy Award\u00ae-winning filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, Back to the Future Part II proves true excitement is timeless.",
