After that adventure that had so much potential ended on a sour note, I decided I needed to find some sort of satisfaction with that wipe. Several days after it all began, I returned to that same server. Little did I know how fruitful this story would become, but all of the success came with an unfortunate and inevitable cost... I hope you enjoy the video!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBRAND NEW MERCH:",

Krauss. Throughout his career, Dr. Krauss has made remarkable contributions to the field of research on particle physics and cosmology. Dr. Krauss formerly worked at Yale University, Case Western Reserve University, and Arizona State University. Dr. Krauss also founded ASU\u2019s Origins Project, a non-profit corporation that holds public panel discussions on science, culture, and social issues. Some of his work includes popular books such as The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing.\n\nJordan and Lawrence sit down to discuss a variety of topics in the mind-boggling world of quantum physics. They spend time discussing generated models of the beginning of our universe, the lawbreaking complexities of quantum physics, the ramifications related to entropy, the usefulness of the scientific method, as well as the instinctive behaviour for religious compulsion among human beings.\n\nThe Jordan B. Peterson Podcast can be found at",

In this video we prove that numbers don't always mean a swift victory. We absolutely dominated the field. So much so that I can easily say this is among my top five duo runs I've ever had. Thank you for your patience. Enjoy the video!\n\nhJune: ",
