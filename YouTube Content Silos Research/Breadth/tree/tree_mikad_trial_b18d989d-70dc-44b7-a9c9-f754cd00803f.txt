                    "description": "Pro wrestling is fake... surprise surprise. But millions of people across the world are absolutely obsessed with it because of its power to sell a story. The characters and their interactions, albeit scripted, create the same level of engagement as any other form of storytelling, including video games. And thanks to a little anchoring heuristic and some good ole fashion \u201cin ring psychology\u201d,  characters in wrestling and in video games can come off as immensely powerful before a match or a boss fight even begins. And Sans is a prime example of this. So today on Psych of Play, we\u2019re taking a look at how Toby Fox put Sans \u201cover\u201d.\n\nTwitter \u25b6",

Coincidentally, also the year when several girls in Le Roy New York began to experience a bizarre illness that seemed to come out of nowhere.... And as fate would have it, both incidents share a disturbing thread when you look at the psychology behind what was happening. Today on Psych of Play, we\u2019re talking Nocebo, Mass Psychogenic Illness, and Illusory Truth. Strap in, this one is a bit spoopy.\n\nTwitter \u25b6",

Box 16204\n30 Karner Road\nAlbany, NY 12212******\nBaddog is a passionate fan who was born, and raised in the state of New York! I am A HUGE sports fan.\nBaddog has a very strong, passionate, roller coaster ride of emotions personality which can sometimes lead to rant and rage videos, about his favorite teams, which many seem to enjoy. This channel is that of a fan, and nothing else. \nMy videos are done from that of my own perspective and views as a fan. I am a HUGE New York Yankees, New York Giants, & New York Knicks fan. \nI do video, and live stream content covering The New York Yankees, New York Giants and Los Angeles Lakers, which has also lead to the nickname \"LakerDog\".\nYou may ask yourself,  \"If Baddog is a Knicks fan, why does he do Los Angeles Laker content?\" \nThe Reason for this is because I have a family,  and because of my work, and gym schedule, streaming all of The Knicks games would be impossible, so I began covering The Lakers in late 2018, because most of their games are played at 9:00PM EST, or later. \nHopefully you guys & gals will find my content enjoyable and will continue to come back for future content!\nIf you do enjoy it, please make sure to subscribe to the channel, and click the bell for notifications. Also, please like, and share the channel if you would be so kind. Hope to see you on the channel!\n\n*******",
