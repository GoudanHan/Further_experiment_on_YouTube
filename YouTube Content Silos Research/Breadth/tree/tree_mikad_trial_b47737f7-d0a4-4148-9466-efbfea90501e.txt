Development is often associated with economic success \u2014 that is countries with higher standards of living and material wealth like those found in Europe and North America. But as we\u2019ll see, this perspective is only one way to compare countries on the global stage, has strong ties to colonialist histories, and doesn\u2019t necessarily capture a place\u2019s environmental and socioeconomic sustainability or even the population\u2019s general happiness. We\u2019ll focus on the region in the Middle East and North Africa, called MENA, and examine how the histories of the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon have resulted in drastically different development scores. \n\n[Sources]\nGeneral\nGetis, Bjelland, and Getis.

Host Peter Lee starts off on the island of Java to see why it was so suited to cultivating rice, used to make exchanges with merchants from the Spice Islands. As demand for spices took off around the world, geography and timing of seasonal sailing winds saw Java grow into the centre for the global spice trade, which enriched Majapahit with luxury trade goods from all over the world. \nWith increased riches, the empire is said to have unified Indonesia\u2019s islands into one nation. Peter travels to Sulawesi to see why the relationship between Majapahit Java and its outer islands was more nuanced than conqueror and subject. Today, the legacy of a united Indonesia under the Majapahit still looms large, where different groups hark back to the era in the face of increasing intolerance and conflict within the island state.\n\nFor more, SUBSCRIBE to CNA INSIDER!

Washington-based journalist Yumi Araki returns to the country of her birth to get at the heart of what it means to be Japanese today. She explores the influences that have shaped the Japanese sense of self, from a connoisseur of kawaii to a modern day Buddhist monk. As the country moves into a new era, there are also those seeking to redefine it. Yumi meets the people involved in these changes, from the new wave of mixed race young people challenging what it means to be Japanese today, to the leader of a radical ultranationalistic political party.\n\nPlaylist: ",

The term describes Japanese who rarely interact with society beyond their family.\n\n\"It's a sense or feeling that you shouldn't be here. Even if you are here, you feel like you aren't yourself,\" Kenji says.\n\nJapan is home to more than one million hikikomori, according to recent government surveys. Many of them are over the age of 40 and rely heavily on their elderly parents.\n\nKenji lives with his 88-year-old mother. \"Year by year, I can feel that she's deteriorating ... I worry about her, but I don't know what to do, so I feel very bad,\" he says. \"I feel sad thinking about when she's gone.\"\n\nAn increasing number of school students are also choosing to shun the outside world. Known as \"futoko\", these children blame a rigid education system, bullying and strict parenting for their social withdrawal. It has led to NGOs setting up education centres across the country as an alternative to Japan's strict schools.\n\nUmi Maekita, who runs Nemonet Free School, says most children who attend these centres eventually return to the mainstream education system. He says early intervention can prevent a lifetime of isolation.\n\n\"Telling them to go back to work or go back to school straight away is not the way,\" he says.\n\n101 East meets the young and old who feel lost in Japan.\n\n- Subscribe to our channel: ",

                "description": "Kenji Yamase spends his days in his bedroom.\n\nThe 54-year-old has been a \"hikikomori\" all of his adult life. The term describes Japanese who rarely interact with society beyond their family.\n\n\"It's a sense or feeling that you shouldn't be here. Even if you are here, you feel like you aren't yourself,\" Kenji says.\n\nJapan is home to more than one million hikikomori, according to recent government surveys. Many of them are over the age of 40 and rely heavily on their elderly parents.\n\nKenji lives with his 88-year-old mother. \"Year by year, I can feel that she's deteriorating ... I worry about her, but I don't know what to do, so I feel very bad,\" he says. \"I feel sad thinking about when she's gone.\"\n\nAn increasing number of school students are also choosing to shun the outside world. Known as \"futoko\", these children blame a rigid education system, bullying and strict parenting for their social withdrawal. It has led to NGOs setting up education centres across the country as an alternative to Japan's strict schools.\n\nUmi Maekita, who runs Nemonet Free School, says most children who attend these centres eventually return to the mainstream education system. He says early intervention can prevent a lifetime of isolation.\n\n\"Telling them to go back to work or go back to school straight away is not the way,\" he says.\n\n101 East meets the young and old who feel lost in Japan.\n\n- Subscribe to our channel: ",

This one tells so many more. We\u2019ll never know for sure, but it\u2019s also probably worth about $20 million. That\u2019s the reported price Prince Andrew will pay Virginia Guiffre to settle a very disturbing legal case against him. She says when she was 17 she was trafficked to the Prince by the paedophile businessman Jeffrey Epstein, ably assisted by his sex-offender partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Despite that photo, Andrew denies ever meeting, let alone having sex with Ms Guiffre, but he\u2019s been so discredited, these days it\u2019s difficult to believe anything the disgraced royal says.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

                        "description": "The disaster at Chernobyl is still considered one of the worst nuclear accidents in history. It happened on April 26, 1986. Thirty-five years later, a group of survivors returns to the ghost city of Pripyat in northern Ukraine.\n\nA senior engineer who worked building the reactor, a maternity doctor from a local hospital, and an 11-year-old girl evacuated from Pripyat survived, as did a firefighter who served in Reactor Block 4 and an army officer who was in charge of removing radioactive debris from the reactor's roof. This documentary follows them as they return to their deserted homes for the first time. Their memories come together like pieces of a puzzle that depicts the fateful events of 1986. Firefighters and soldiers who became known as \"liquidators\" risked their lives to stabilize the site and prevent even greater radioactive contamination of Europe and the world. Only a few survived the mission. This emotional documentary directed by Roman Shumunov and written by Simon Shechter recounts a major historical drama in small, intimate stories, while using never before seen archive material that the people of Pripyat had hidden in their homes.",

Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.\n\nSome call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?\n\n\"People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,\" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.\n\nAnyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn\u2019t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that \"The Greed Program,\" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.\n\nChapters:",

Surrounded by hooded Huthi rebels, who fire warning shots with their weapons. When Mariam\u2018s son resists, the men throw hand grenades into the house. The bride and many other family members are wounded, some seriously. \"I threw myself protectively on my son.

Our film team meets entomologists, farmers, scientists, chemical companies and politicians in a bid to lay bare the causes of insect mortality.\n\nInsects aren\u2019t really likeable. They sting, bite, transmit diseases and frighten children. But, on the other hand, they are also fascinating: 480 million years ago, insects were the first animals to learn to fly, and they took over the Earth. Even now, they are fundamental to life on Earth, and are at the beginning of the food chain on which all human beings are ultimately dependent.\nBut insect numbers worldwide are dropping, creating a rupture of  the food chain. Environmentalists and scientists are now extremely worried. Landscape ecology professor Alexandra-Maria Klein from Freiburg, for example, has been researching the effects of human interventions in natural environments for decades and has launched an experiment in a fruit plantation on Lake Constance: What happens when insects disappear? An ominous silence is settling on places that were once humming and buzzing. Why are the insects dying? Author Christoph W\u00fcrzburger takes a journey into the fascinating world of insects and meets entomologists, farmers, scientists, chemical companies and politicians in a search for the causes of insect mortality.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Yes, if you believe the man you're about to meet. Richard Godfrey is no crackpot; he's a respected British aerospace engineer and physicist who says he's found the doomed airliner. If he's right, he'll provide desperately needed answers for the families of the 239 passengers and crew who were aboard the Boeing triple-seven when it vanished eight years ago. But knowing where it is isn't the end of the story - Richard also has to convince authorities to resume the search that's already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

The huge shock wave destroyed large parts of the city. 200 people died, over 6,500 were injured and hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless.\n\nThe fire brigade was called to Beirut port just before 6pm to extinguish a fire in a warehouse. They heard a strange crackling noise but were utterly unprepared for what happened next. It was a massive explosion, later estimated to be the equivalent of 1.1 kilotons of TNT. As a comparison, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was the equivalent of 15 kilotons. \n\nOne year after the explosion, its exact cause has still not been explained. It\u2019s also unclear who bears responsibility for the catastrophe. The whole government under Lebanese prime minister Hassan Diab had to step down - but is still in office in a caretaker role. No one has yet been held accountable. The film is an attempt to reconstruct the events. \n\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We investigated the shameful secrets of the multinationals who produce our mobile phones. They are the big winners of the mobile revolution as their profits explode but what is the human and environmental cost in the production countries of China and the Congo?\nWe bring exclusive footage from inside Chinese factories where scores of children are working long hours under arduous conditions. The multinationals claim they are doing all they can, but these shocking images say otherwise. In Africa the mines that retrieve minerals essential to components in our smartphones are dangerous and unregulated. Injuries and deaths occur regularly amongst workers just desperate to support their families. Whilst in China the environmental damage has scarred the landscape, emptied a village and possibly caused severe illness among the population.\nWe confront the major names in the smartphone industry with the realities that they would like to keep hidden.\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: ",

                "description": "Since the start of the pandemic, 21 delivery workers in South Korea have died. Unions blame overwork. The Koreans even have a word for death by overwork: 'gwarosa'. \n\nWe all rely on home deliveries to get us through the pandemic but do we ever spare a thought for the workers who bring them to us?\n\nAs demand for home deliveries explodes, the pressure on warehouse sorters and drivers has become relentless. \n\nLee Seong Wook, 44, is a delivery driver. He works six days a week from early in the morning until late at night.\n\n\u201cI'd be lying if I said it isn't tough for me. But it\u2019s a matter of survival. My children won't eat if I don't earn.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s colleague, 47-year-old driver Im Gwang Soo, recently suffered a massive brain haemorrhage and fell into a coma. His life is hanging in the balance. Before his collapse, Im Gwang Soo had been working over 90 hours a week.\n\nAs companies compete with each other to offer faster delivery times, distribution workers and drivers have borne the brunt, putting in longer and longer hours. \n\nThe ABC\u2019s South Korea correspondent Carrington Clarke goes on the road with the drivers and hears stories of their struggles as they race against the clock to deliver more packages than ever before.\n\nHe rides with 61-year-old driver Huh Wonjea, the son of an activist and fighter in the Korean Independence Movement. Mr Huh says South Koreans worked hard to rebuild their country after the war, but not everyone is reaping the rewards.\n\n\u201cThe whole country\u2019s been developing, but still in terms of the fair distribution of the assets or human rights\u2026 not really fairly developed yet.\u201d\n\nLee Seong Wook is a branch leader of the Delivery Workers\u2019 Union. He\u2019s determined that his generation will be the one to force change.\n\n\u201cIf our generation can't change it, it\u2019ll be passed down to the next generation and then what we sacrifice for our children would be meaningless. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s not just the drivers who are suffering. Those working in the distribution centres are also being pushed to their limits and beyond.\n\n27-year-old Jang Deokjoon died of a heart attack. He\u2019d been working long hours in the \u201cfulfillment centre\u201d of e-commerce company Coupang, described as the \u201cAmazon\u201d of South Korea. The government ruled it was \u201cdeath by overwork\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese really clever people used their brains only to work out how to squeeze as much blood from the workers as possible within the boundaries of the law\u201d, says Deokjoon\u2019s mother.\n\nIn response to union pressure, some companies have introduced restrictions on delivering parcels after 9pm. But many drivers still have parcels left. If they don\u2019t deliver them, their workload the following day will be even greater, so they keep working. For any food items they deliver after the 9pm cutoff, they\u2019ll pay late fees. They\u2019re damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t.\n\nDead on Arrival is a timely and cautionary tale of what happens when workers are pushed to the limit in the name of consumer convenience and company profits.\n\n\u201cIf consumers don\u2019t start thinking about it there will be other victims. Do you really think it\u2019s okay to turn a blind eye or force someone to be sacrificed for your convenience?\u201d, asks Deokjoon\u2019s mother.\n\nAbout Foreign Correspondent: \nForeign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

            "description": "Around the world more and more people are opting for the single life but in Japan, loneliness has become an epidemic.\n\nMarriage and childbirth rates are falling, as more and more young Japanese choose to stay single and childless. Relationships are too difficult, they say.\n\nIn the country\u2019s last Fertility Survey, figures showed that a quarter of women in their 30s were single, and half of those weren\u2019t interested in having a relationship. \n\nMany Japanese adults aren\u2019t even having sex. It\u2019s estimated around 10% of people in their 30s are still virgins.\n \nBy 2040, it\u2019s estimated nearly half of Japan\u2019s population will be single.\nCorrespondent Jake Sturmer has reported from the ABC\u2019s Tokyo bureau for 4 years and nothing has confounded him more than this social crisis.\nAs he prepares to return to Australia, Jake sets out on a final journey to discover the forces driving this \u2018Solo Society\u2019.\n\nHe meets 29-year-old Sayaka, who works in the fashion industry. Sayaka is happily single, and not interested in getting married. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m under a lot of (social) pressure but I don\u2019t mind,\u201d she says. \u201cThere's nothing I can\u2019t do without a man at the moment.\u201d\n\nInstead, the objects of her affection are her dogs - Kogemaru, Unimaru, Rinmaru and Riko - whom she loves to spoil.\n\nNaoya, a 32-year-old creative director for an advertising company, isn\u2019t in a rush to get married either. He often feels lonely but hanging out with friends cheers him up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun drinking with my friends like this and I\u2019m able to fill in the loneliness,\u201d Naoya tells Jake in a cosy bar in downtown Tokyo.\n\nJake also explores a darker side of Japanese society, meeting a man who has opted out in an extreme way, hiding in his bedroom and avoiding society altogether. He\u2019s what\u2019s called a hikikomori, someone who withdrawn socially. \n\nIn Japan there are more than a million hikikomori. Jake meets the mother of one who\u2019s become an activist, campaigning for Japanese society to be more tolerant of those who don\u2019t fit the mould.\n\n\u201cPeople believe they need to change the people who\u2019ve withdrawn but I think it\u2019s exactly the opposite. I think the society should change,\u201d she says.\n\nJake spends time with Masatomi, a cleaner whose job is to clear out the homes of those who die alone. Each year, tens of thousands of Japanese end their lives alone, their bodies often found after neighbours detect an odour. Masatomi is calling for Japanese people to sit up and take notice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that could happen to anybody including myself. I strongly feel that we need to have connections with other people. I feel outrage, why don\u2019t they see what\u2019s going on?\"\n\nAbout Foreign Correspondent: \nForeign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

Much of the script-writing was inspired and informed by his wonderful book Sync, and his 2004 TED talk. He is a giant in this field, and has literally written the book on chaos, complexity, and synchronization. It was hard to find a paper in this field that Steven (or one of his students) didn't contribute to. His Podcast \"The Joy of X\" is wonderful \u2014 please listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts ",

What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?\n\nHuge thanks to:\nProf. Konstantin Batygin, Caltech\nProf. David Jewitt, UCLA\n\nI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nAlfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige Thorman\n\nMusic from ",
