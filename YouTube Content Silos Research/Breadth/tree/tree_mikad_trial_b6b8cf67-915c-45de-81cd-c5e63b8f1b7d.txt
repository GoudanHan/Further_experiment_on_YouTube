Although many of the studies show certain results, there is no way to test and observe ancient humans. So, the conclusions in a number of papers are theories as to why humans may behave the way they do from an evolutionary perspective. This is done by observing other animals and modern day humans. As a result, evolutionary psychology is often reductionist and can fail to take into account social factors. My point is don\u2019t go using evolutionary psychology as an excuse to cheat or something LOL. Additionally, although \"Male Gaze\"/\"Female Gaze\" are terms coined by Laura Mulvey, we will be discussing both terms from the perspective of the Tik Tok trend.\n\nThe beauty and personal care industry for men and women is a multibillion dollar business. While some of that is spent for reasons of self satisfaction, a large amount is spent to attract a mate. There\u2019s just one problem. Unless you date the same sex, sometimes what you think is attractive about yourself isn\u2019t what the opposite sex is attracted to. This phenomena is commonly known as the male vs female gaze. The male gaze describes what men typically view as attractive in men and women. The female gaze describes what women typically view as attractive in men and women. This has sparked discussion all over the internet about what causes these differences in opinion. Today we will be examining the possible cause of this difference by analyzing the male and female gaze from an evolutionary perspective. \n\nFIND ME HERE\nYouTube: ",

It\u2019s Pride Month, and the 2020 Democratic contenders have been courting LGBTQ voters in a big way. But although most LGBT voters identified as Democrats in 2018, being trans, gay or pansexual does not a Democrat make.\n\nVICE News put together a panel made up of 12 members of the LGBTQ+ community and asked them about their politics \u2014 which were extremely diverse \u2014 and who they like for 2020.\n\n\u201cI think Donald Trump is really changing the Republican Party by working with the gay and lesbian community,\u201d said Paul Ramirez, a Republican gay man and the vp of advertising at The Wisdom Companies. \u201cIf there was a homophobic drop of blood in him, we would have heard that 20 years ago.\u201d\n\nOthers decidedly disagreed about Trump's record on LBGTQ issues, and its effect on the community.\n\n\u201cWhen the Trump administration, or perhaps just Trump via Twitter, puts out a statement saying that \u2018no more trans people are allowed in the military, that\u2019s it we\u2019re cutting you off and anybody in has got to leave.\u2019 That affects the lives of transgender citizens of this country,\u201d said actor Donnie Cianciotto, who identifies as a pansexual transgender man and a Democrat. \u201cIt makes us appear 'less than' to other people, who now can justify their bigotry and their transphobia, because look at what the government does.\u201d\n\nAs for Mayor Pete, the openly gay candidate running for President, his out and proud status wasn\u2019t enough for panelists, on either end of the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing fresh. He's an Obama sequel,\u201d said Brandon Straka, a Republican gay man and founder of the # WalkAway Campaign, which aims to get left-leaning voters to turn away from the Democratic Party. \u201cThe fact that he's gay \u2014 that doesn't mean he has my back as a trans person,\u201d said LGBTQIA+ educator and activist Jamey Jesperson, who identifies as a progressive queer non-binary asexual transfemme. \u201cIt means nothing to me that he is a gay person, because he's also cis, and he's also white.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: ",

This video was recorded at The Australian National University on 10 April 2012.\n\nRichard Dawkins FRS is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford. Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.\n\nHe is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.\n\nRichard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He has been awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the Nakayama Prize, the Cosmos International Prize, the Kistler Prize, the Shakespeare Prize and the Lewis Thomas Prize.\n\nLawrence M. Krauss is a renowned cosmologist and science populariser, and is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is also the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and nine books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and his most recent bestseller entitled A Universe from Nothing.\n\nHe received his PhD from MIT in 1982 and then joined the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and was a professor at Yale University and Chair of the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University before taking his present position. Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist and Scientific American and appears regularly on radio and television. He is one of the few scientists to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, and is also active in issues of science and society. He serves as co-chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and on the Board of Directors of the Federation of American Scientists.",

Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.\n\nDirected by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?\n\nFind out more: ",

The exponential exhaustion of natural resources, declining productivity, slow growth, rising unemployment, and steep inequality, forces us to rethink our economic models. Where do we go from here? In this feature-length documentary, social and economic theorist Jeremy Rifkin lays out a road map to usher in a new economic system. \n\nA Third Industrial Revolution is unfolding with the convergence of three pivotal technologies: an ultra-fast 5G communication internet, a renewable energy internet, and a driverless mobility internet, all connected to the Internet of Things embedded across society and the environment. \n\nThis 21st century smart digital infrastructure is giving rise to a radical new sharing economy that is transforming the way we manage, power and move economic life. But with climate change now ravaging the planet, it needs to happen fast. Change of this magnitude requires political will and a profound ideological shift. \n\nTo learn more visit: ",
