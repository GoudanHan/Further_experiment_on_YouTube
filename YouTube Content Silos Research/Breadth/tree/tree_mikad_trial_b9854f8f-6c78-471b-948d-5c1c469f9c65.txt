Recently, there was a special on Netflix titled Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, which discussed some of the evidence around arguably the most notorious serial killer. Ted Bundy's behavior, as documented in the special and in other resources, has been discussed and analyzed by many over the years. I'll try to answer several questions including:\n\nWas Ted Bundy  special?\nWhat evidence supports the theory that Ted Bundy was psychopathic, narcissistic, or had bipolar symptoms?\nWhy was he able to evade detection and commit so many heinous crimes?\nWhy is Ted Bundy fascinating to so many?\nWhy did so many people believe that Ted Bundy was innocent?",

It is an interesting case because it involves parricide, which is a rare type of homicide where children kill their parents. It's also interesting because it weaves the mental health components with ethics and confidentiality into the law.\n\nFacts of the Case:\nThis case goes back to 1989, when two brothers Lyle Menendez (21 at the time) and Eric Menendez (18 at the time) lived in a Beverly Hills mansion with their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez. On August 18, 1989, the brothers bought two shotguns from a sporting goods store in San Diego. Two days later, Sunday night August 20, 1989 the crime took place. Jose was seated on a couch in the family room sleeping and Kitty was laying down with her head on his lap. One of the brothers aimed the 12-gauge shotgun at Jose, fired the shotgun, and struck him in the left elbow and the right arm. The other brother walked up behind Jose and shot him in the back of the head. Because of the shooting, Kitty woke up and she tried to flee, but she was injured by shots fired by the brothers. She was not killed at that time, so the brothers went out to their car because they ran out of ammunition before they could kill their mother. They reloaded the shotguns with birdshot came back in and shot her in the head several times. After Lyle and Erik killed their parents, they shot both Jose and Kitty each in the knee. They called the police and made an effort to cover up their crimes.\n\nIn 1996, a jury returned a guilty verdict and the brothers both received two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.\n\nMulvey, A., Fournier, A., & Donahue, T.

Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss.

                    "description": "This interview was not conducted to be a stand-alone interview, it was conducted for a Dutch documentary about male/female-dynamics in Canada. Within this documentary, we explored how an event like the Toronto van attack could happen in Canada and how Canadians are trying to heal from it. More broadly, we looked at misogyny and violence against women within Canada, and what it is about contemporary feminism that makes some men angry or lost. We also paid attention to men suffering from violence that their female partners had inflicted upon them. As prominent Canadian voices, we included both Margaret Atwood and Jordan Peterson.\n\nPsychology professor Jordan Peterson has become a controversial figure ever since speaking out against Bill C-16 (2016), a law which adds gender expression and gender identity to the Canadian Human Rights Act. He has received both praise and criticism after the publication of his self-help book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018). His fans are thankful for the advice he\u2019s given them to take responsibility for their lives, his critics argue that his emphasis on the danger posed by \u2018postmodern neo-marxists\u2019 is dangerous in itself. He has been accused of being anti-feminist and feeding into the alt-right. While he gained support among people who do identify with the alt-right, he himself does not. \n\nPeterson has become an important inspiration for various men\u2019s groups, an influential voice. Therefore, we wanted to get clear where he stands on contemporary feminism and how he interprets the van attack, which took place in the city he lives in. Since the documentary episode only allowed for brief passages from the interview, while Peterson\u2019s answers are extensive, we decided to provide the entire interview.\n\nWe talked to Peterson on the 4th of June 2019, in Toronto, Ontario. Since there were some breaks (for adjusting the camera and for having coffee) during the interview, it consists of multiple takes. Apart from leaving out the breaks themselves and making the transition between breaks more fluent, no further editing has been done. \n\nThe documentary about the Toronto van attack and male-female dynamics in Canada is available here: ",

Pozner spoke on the impact of US foreign policy towards Russia after the Soviet Union has been disbanded, and shared his opinions on a range of issues raised by the audience, from the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, to Skripal poisoning, to the state of independent media in Russia and the US.",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

Believing America to be a saviour and a life of hope, the \u2018Addergoole 14\u2019 saved fiercely in order to afford a ticket aboard the Titanic and escape to the land of dreams. Told using interviews with the descendants of survivors, these are new perspectives of the conditions on board, and the events of April 12th 1912. Focusing not on the glory and fate of the ship, this new look at a famous tragedy uncovers ordinary lives and fragile hopes of the community that lost more that fateful night than any other.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

But that story begins exactly three years earlier, with the dream of building the largest moving object ever made. Using breathtaking CGI images incorporating fully dramatised reconstructions, This film, narrated by Charles Dance relives the extraordinary realisation of that dream in a story filled with triumph, despair, avarice and ambition... and finally tragedy.\n\nThis film was first broadcast: 29 Dec 2005\n\nAwards: Best Digital Effects at the RTS Craft & Design Awards 2005/2006.\n\nWatch More Documentaries\nOur Life - ",
