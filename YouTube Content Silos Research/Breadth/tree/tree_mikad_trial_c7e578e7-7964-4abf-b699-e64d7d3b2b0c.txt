In this frank, no-holds-barred conversation, they discuss the United States\u2019 mission in Afghanistan: how it began, how it was conducted, and its ignominious end. McMaster and Hanson debate what worked and what failed, how social issues in the United States may have influenced our mission in Afghanistan and our decision to leave, and whether or not the United States should have continued to maintain a presence instead of leaving in a matter of weeks, abandoning thousands of Afghans loyal to the US mission there (as well as an unknown number of US citizens) after 20 years of military operations in the country.\n\nFor further information: ",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

In addition, Hanson talks about immigration and assimilation in the United States throughout time. Hanson notes that, when immigrants assimilate and embrace the United States, then immigration works and strengthens us, but that when immigrants seek to separate themselves and reject US values and culture, then immigration becomes detrimental. Hanson ends the interview talking about the 2016 presidential candidates and election.\n\nInterested in more of Uncommon Knowledge content?

Well known for his sharp wit as well as his originalist approach to the Constitution, Justice Scalia consistently asks more questions during oral arguments and makes more comments than any other Supreme Court justice. And, according to one study, he also gets the most laughs from those who come to watch these arguments. In September 2010, Justice Scalia spoke with UC Hastings law professor Calvin Massey.

In 2007, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal, and in 2008, he received the Bradley Prize.\n\nHe is a columnist for National Review Online and for Tribune Media Services, and has published in several journals and newspapers, including Commentary, the Claremont Review of Books, The New Criterion, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal. Dr. Hanson has written or edited numerous books, including Wars of the Ancient Greeks, A War Like No Other: How the Athenians and Spartans Fought the Peloponnesian War, and his latest book, The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won.\n\nHillsdale College is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women \u201cgrateful to God for the inestimable blessings\u201d resulting from civil and religious liberty and \u201cbelieving that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.\u201d It pursues the stated object of the founders: \u201cto furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological education\u201d outstanding among American colleges \u201cand to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.\u201d As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains \u201cby precept and example\u201d the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.\n\nThe College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.\n\nBy training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.",

Its second project, \"Shield\", catalyzed state and federal action to help protect the North American electrical grid from threats due to solar storms and cyber-attack, including a 2019 Presidential Executive Order. Its third, 'America in One Room', organized one of the largest political experiments in U.S. history in an effort to improve the way citizens evaluate candidates for public office, featured on the front page of the New York Times, and was hailed by US President Barack Obama.\n\nHelena operates its projects with a small group of leaders it calls \"Helena Members\". They include Nobel Laureates, Academy Award winners, former CIA Directors, Olympic athletes, NGO leaders, technology entrepreneurs, explorers and more.\n\nOutside of Helena, Sam serves as Social Entrepreneur in Residence at The Boston Consulting Group. In 2014, Sam won the World Schools Debating Championships as a member of the England Debate Team.\n\n This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

And yet, we are wiping out the very animals we should celebrate; we are the flood coming for Noah's Ark. Carl leaves us with a difficult question: Do we have what it takes to let life on earth survive?\n\nCarl Safina\u2019s work has been recognized with MacArthur, Pew, and Guggenheim Fellowships, and his writing has won the Lannan Literary Award and the John Burroughs, James Beard, and George Rabb medals. He has a PhD in ecology from Rutgers University. Safina is the inaugural endowed professor for nature and humanity at Stony Brook University, where he co-chairs the steering committee of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and is founding president of the not-for-profit Safina Center. He hosted the 10-part PBS series Saving the Ocean with Carl Safina. His writing appears in The New York Times, National Geographic, Audubon and other periodicals, and on the Web at National Geographic News and Views, Huffington Post, and CNN.com. Carl Safina\u2019s writing shows how humanity is changing the natural world and what those changes mean for wildlife and for people.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

In this sobering talk, atmospheric scientist Brian Toon explains how even a small nuclear war could destroy all life on earth -- and what we can do to prevent it. A professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Brian Toon investigates the causes of the ozone hole, how volcanic eruptions alter the climate, how ancient Mars had flowing rivers, and the environmental impacts of nuclear war. He contributed to the U.N.\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize for climate change and holds numerous scientific awards, including two NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement.

        "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. \n\nHow did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. \n\nHanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. \n\nHanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers. \n\nFor further information: ",

Inflation occurs when the quantity of money increases faster than the quantity of goods. Why does the money supply increase? Very often, it does so to enable the government to pay its bills without raising taxes. There's only one real cure for inflation. It is a cure that's easy to describe but difficult to apply: The government must reduce spending and print less money. The alternatives are both recession and double-digit inflation.

But what about when those technologies destroy the environment? In this provocative talk, Time Magazine \u201cHero of the Environment\u201d and energy expert, Michael Shellenberger explains why solar and wind farms require so much land for mining and energy production, and an alternative path to saving both the climate and the natural environment. Michael Shellenberger is a Time Magazine Hero of the Environment and President of Environmental Progress, a research and policy organization. A lifelong environmentalist, Michael changed his mind about nuclear energy and has helped save enough nuclear reactors to prevent an increase in carbon emissions equivalent to adding more than 10 million cars to the road. He lives in Berkeley, California. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

In addition to high-profile smash-and-grab robberies in San Francisco's Union Square and malls outside the city, the publication of Michael Shellenberger's new book, San Fransicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities, also drew attention to increasing disorder on San Francisco's streets; the book and its arguments received attention across the political spectrum from media around the World.\n\nA Bay Area resident for more than 30 years, Shellenberger says progressive policies are, in good part, the reason for homelessness and crime in San Francisco (and similar cities on the West Coast). From homeless encampments to open-air drug markets and retail robberies, he says progressive leaders have gone beyond merely tolerating these issues and now actively enable them through specific public policy choices by urban lawmakers and district attorneys. Shellenberger believes that urban problems such as homelessness and drug dealing aren't primarily from a lack of housing, money for social programs or other \"root causes.\" Instead, he feels the real problem is an ideology that designates some people, by identity or experience, as victims entitled to destructive behaviors and a hands-off approach to law enforcement that coddles them. The result, he says, is an undermining of the values that make cities, and civilization itself, possible.\n\nPlease join us as Shellenberger makes one of his first local public appearances to discuss his controversial book and the new crime policies launched in San Francisco.\n\nNOTES\n\nThis program is supported by the Ken & Jaclyn Broad Family Fund. Complimentary copies of Shellenberger\u2019s San Fransicko will be available to in-person attendees thanks to their support.\n\nPhoto by Gabriel Harber.\n\nJANUARY  24, 2022\n\nSPEAKERS\n\nMichael Shellenberger\nFounder and President, Environmental Progress; Author, San Fransicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities\n\nMelissa Caen\nPolitical Analyst; Attorney\u2014Moderator\n\n\ud83c\udf89 BECOME a MEMBER: ",

The real problem for the poor is the destruction of the family, which Sowell argues dramatically increased once welfare policies were introduced in the 1960s.",

Now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Sowell has published more than a dozen books, the latest of which is Dismantling America.\n\nIn introducing his new book, Sowell asserts that the Obama administration \"is the embodiment, the personification, and the culmination of dangerous trends that began decades ago,\" trends that are \"dismantling America.\"  Sowell sees this in the dismantling of marriage, of culture, and of self-government.",

He is the author of nine works of history, including the first two volumes of his planned three-volume history of Russian power and Joseph Stalin, Paradoxes of Power, 1878\u20131928 and Waiting for Hitler, 1929\u20131941. The premise of this show is simple: Peter Robinson poses five questions to Dr. Kotkin: what Xi Jinping, the president of China believes; what Vladimir Putin believes; whether nuclear weapons are a deterrent in the 21st century; the chances of another American renewal; and Kotkin\u2019s rational basis for loving the United States. It\u2019s a fascinating conversation that delves deep into one of the country\u2019s brightest minds. \n\nFor further information: ",

Now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Sowell has published more than a dozen books, the latest of which is a revised and updated edition of his classic volume, Basic Economics.\n\n\"Through its various editions,\" Sowell writes, \"the fundamental idea behind Basic Economics remains the same:  Learning economics should be as uncomplicated as it is informative.\"  Here, Sowell seeks to uncomplicate some of the economic issues confronting the country today, from the financial crisis and the role of the Fed to the economics of health care and trade imbalances.",

(1) The \"robber baron\" myth, which holds that in late nineteenth-century America there were powerful men who became rich at the expense of the poor. The reality is that they became wealthy by being productive, and that there is no other period in history which saw such a rapid and widespread improvement in the well-being of the average individual; (2) The myth that the Great Depression was caused by a failure of business, when it was, in fact, produced by a failure of government and specifically by the Federal Reserve System; (3) The myth that government in the economy has expanded in response to public demand, when, actually, the public has had to be sold \"hard\" for politicians to enact every major social program; (4) The \"free lunch\" myth, which forces the individual to pay more, no matter how the government raises money - by taxing individuals, by taxing businesses, or by printing more money; and (5) The myth that government, like Robin Hood, transfers wealth from the rich to the poor, when the reality is that the government usually transfers wealth and income from both the very rich and the very poor to those in the middle.\n\nCheck out our Facebook page here: ",

Yes, if you believe the man you're about to meet. Richard Godfrey is no crackpot; he's a respected British aerospace engineer and physicist who says he's found the doomed airliner. If he's right, he'll provide desperately needed answers for the families of the 239 passengers and crew who were aboard the Boeing triple-seven when it vanished eight years ago. But knowing where it is isn't the end of the story - Richard also has to convince authorities to resume the search that's already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

            "description": "Recorded on February 27, 2017\n\nIn the latest episode from Uncommon Knowledge, Sir Roger Scruton, a formally trained political philosopher, talks about his life and the events he\u2019s witnessed that led him to conservatism. He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain.\n \nSir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didn\u2019t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics.\n \nRobinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the \u201cindigenous working classes\u201d who made their voices known through their votes.\n \nAbout the Guest: Sir Roger Scruton\nSir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his \u201cservices to philosophy, teaching and public education.\u201d\n \n \nAdditional Resources:\n \nBrexit:",

Peterson is a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, and a clinical psychologist, with two main areas of study: the psychology of belief, including religion, mythology and political ideology; and the assessment and improvement of personality,\nincluding the prediction of creativity and academic and industrial performance.\n\nAfter completing his undergrad degree at Grande Prairie College and the University of Alberta, Dr. Peterson earned a Ph.D. in psychology at McGill in 1991, and was a post-doc at McGill's Douglas Hospital. In 1993, he joined the psychology faculty at Harvard. He moved to the University of Toronto in 1997. His work has been funded by SSHRC, CIHR and NSERC (major Canadian granting agencies), and the Rotman Business School Center for Integrative Thinking. He was nominated for the Levenson Prize at Harvard in 1998, and by TVO each year from 2005-2008 as one of Ontario's Best University Lecturers. He also serves as an essayist and panelist for TVO's The Agenda, a well-known Canadian current affairs program, and is a popular source of information for other media outlets, including TVO's Big Ideas, which has televised five of his lectures.\n\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

        "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018\n\nThomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.\n\nSowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.\n\nSowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).\n\nRobinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.\n\nInterested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?
