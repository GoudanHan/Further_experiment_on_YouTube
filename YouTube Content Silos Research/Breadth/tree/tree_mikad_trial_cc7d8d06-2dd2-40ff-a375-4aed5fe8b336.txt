This is part 2 of that conversation. \n\nWithin the LGBTQ umbrella lies a multitude of identities and ideologies. In an effort to showcase this VICE gathers a diverse group of progressive and conservative members of the LGBTQ community to discuss topics that relate to queerness and its intersection with culture, and politics. \n\nOur goal is to foster conversations that are already happening within communities. With this format, we hope to give the viewer a rare opportunity to witness a conversation with people across the aisle that they otherwise might never find themselves in.\n\nTIMECODES OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED:",

Jihyun is one of the most remarkable people we have ever had on the show. We asked Jihyun what she would like to promote in the top comment and she said she only wanted to say the following: \"North Korean dictators do not want the light to enter the North Koreans, but I accuse the North Korean regime of the cruel acts they have committed by the North Korean regime for the freedom of the North Korean people and the liberation of slaves.\"",

To make you laugh, to give me an opportunity to do my favorite things which are watch movies, green-screen myself into movies, talk about movies, and to play with makeup. I make fun of these movies with love! I respect all actors, directors, writers, etc who are out there doing their thing and getting paid for it. xoxo\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc BE MY FRIEND! \u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\nFACEBOOK: ",

Apparently there IS irrefutable evidence for God, and we've just been ignoring it this whole time! It does give me a great opportunity to answer some common questions about atheism, and why I do what I do.\n\nLike and subscribe if you enjoyed!\n\nGaming Channel: ",

Come along for the ride and see Hannah like never before as she returns to her roots and faces the most important decision of her life! When Miley Stewart (aka pop-star Hannah Montana) gets too caught up in the superstar celebrity lifestyle, her dad decides it's time for a total change of scenery. But sweet niblets! Miley must trade in all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for some ol' blue jeans on the family farm in Tennessee, and question if she can be both Miley Stewart and Hannah Montana. With a little help from her friends -- and awesome guest stars Taylor Swift, Rascal Flatts and Vanessa Williams -- will she figure out whether to choose Hannah or Miley? HANNAH MONTANA THE MOVIE is a heartfelt major motion picture perfect for the entire family.",
