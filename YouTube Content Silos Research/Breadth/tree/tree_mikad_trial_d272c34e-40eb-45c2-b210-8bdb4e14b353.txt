It's called structured water, or hexagonal water. Or at least that's what some would have you believe so that they can sell you devices that will \"structure\" the water you drink and make it better for you. Also, did you know that water responds to emotions, and has memory, just like humans? No wait, that's another lie with zero substantiation. Man, people really lie a lot about water, don't they? Let's wrap up the trilogy and debunk some charlatans, shall we?\n\nMasaru Emoto's hoax: ",

This is the notion that the positions of the stars and planets in the sky at the moment of your birth have an influence on your characteristics, and that their positions over time influence daily events. Can this be possible? By what mechanism does this influence propagate? If it's true, why haven't we encountered anything like this in our study of astronomy? Shouldn't we be able to do experiments to test its validity? We sure can. Let's take a real good look at what astrology proposes, and see if we can to the bottom of whether there is any truth to it or not.\n\nLarge-scale study showing no correlation between date of birth and personality: ",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
