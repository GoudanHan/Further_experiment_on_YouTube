In this sobering talk, atmospheric scientist Brian Toon explains how even a small nuclear war could destroy all life on earth -- and what we can do to prevent it. A professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Brian Toon investigates the causes of the ozone hole, how volcanic eruptions alter the climate, how ancient Mars had flowing rivers, and the environmental impacts of nuclear war. He contributed to the U.N.\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize for climate change and holds numerous scientific awards, including two NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement. He is an avid woodworker. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

Pressed to explain the inconsistencies, Lewandowski responded that he had \"no obligation to be honest with the media.\"\n\nStream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: ",

He identifies the varieties, the reasons, and the potential costs and benefits, arguing that leaders often lie for good strategic reasons, while distinguishing between lying to another state and lying to one's own people.\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is also the co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago and has written extensively about security issues and international politics.\n\nThe World Beyond the Headlines is a project of the Center for International Studies, which brings scholars, journalists, and world leaders to the University to discuss issues of current global importance. \n\nFor more information on this event, visit ",

He calls for a compassionate approach toward addiction, whether in ourselves or in others. Dr Mat\u00e9 believes addiction is not a choice, neither is it all about drugs and illicit substances. Instead, he believes that addiction affects most of us \u2013 whether it be to alcohol, nicotine, sugar, work or exercise\u2026the list is endless. According to Dr Mat\u00e9, the source of addiction is not to be found in our genes but in our early childhood.\n \nWe also talk about how our emotional stress translates into physical chronic illnesses and how we now live in a culture that doesn\u2019t meet our human needs. Indeed, the conditions necessary for healthy child development are increasingly under threat in today\u2019s society. Loneliness and lack of meaningful connection are on the rise, as are the rates of autoimmune disease and addiction. We discuss how the way we live our modern lives is impacting us more than we realise.\n \nIt was a real honour to sit down and talk eye-to-eye with Gabor about his truly revolutionary work. This was a deep and powerful conversation and I hope it helps you in your lives.\n\nShow notes available at: ",

We now have glaring scientific evidence that childhood adversity can create harmful levels of stress, especially if a child is left to manage their responses to that adversity without emotionally reliable relationships. The vision for ACE Aware Nation is that all 5 million citizens of Scotland should have access to this information. The \u2018ACEs to Assets Conference\u2019 was held on 11 June 2019 in Glasgow, drawing an audience of nearly 2000 members of the public keen to explore actions that can be taken to prevent and heal the impacts of childhood trauma. \n\nIn this film, we hear from Dr. Gabor Mate, international expert on trauma, who explores the theme of trauma as disconnection from the self and why relationships are central to the prevention and recovery of trauma.",

This is truly a video for you if you want to learn how to make the perfect steak! I hope you enjoy friends, and start making those Steaks! You will learn 5 very important  things to do.\n#1 Don\u2019t waste your time taking the steak out 20 minutes before cooking it.  It accomplishes NOTHING.\n#2 Do not wait the last minute to salt your steak.  Add salt AT LEAST 45 minutes before cooking it! (one or two days is even better!)\n#3 Get yourself a good instant read thermometer, pushing your thumb in the palm of your hand DOES NOT WORK!\n#4 Searing the steak DOES NOT seal in the juices. (its only purpose is to create a delicious crust)\n#5 Be sure to let it rest at least 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven. Before cutting into it.\n\nRecipe Link: ",

And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020. \n\n\nArtist:                   Secret Garden\nAlbum:                Earthsongs\nTrack:                   Lotus\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

You\u2019ll be amazed at the world-changing outcomes discomfort can have on your life and the lives of others.\n\nBill Eckstrom is an entrepreneur, author, speaker, outdoorsman and father of three. With a passion deeply rooted in growth and development, Bill has always been fascinated by the role a coach has on the performance of individuals and teams. As a result, he founded the EcSell Institute whose sole focus is to educate, track and measure coaching effectiveness for leaders within organizations around the world. This has led to hundreds of keynotes, published articles and e-books created from the research and documentation of coaching interactions and outcomes.

His work has been funded by SSHRC, CIHR and NSERC (major Canadian granting agencies), and the Rotman Business School Center for Integrative Thinking. He was nominated for the Levenson Prize at Harvard in 1998, and by TVO each year from 2005-2008 as one of Ontario's Best University Lecturers. He also serves as an essayist and panelist for TVO's The Agenda, a well-known Canadian current affairs program, and is a popular source of information for other media outlets, including TVO's Big Ideas, which has televised five of his lectures.\n\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

He believes that we all benefit from increasing the everyday possibilities to articulate those feelings that are far too often left internalised. Don\u2019t miss this incredibly personal talk in which Gareth shares his story of his battle with depression during his time as an undergraduate student, how he found the space to talk, and how he recovered from this low point through helping others to find that space too. You can continue the conversation with him on Twitter: @Garethjgriffith Gareth Griffith is an Advanced Quantitative Methods PhD student at the University of Bristol. He is interested in all things Mental Health, Wellbeing, Quantitative Methods and Social Inequality. His research focuses on using advanced statistical methodologies to address inequality in mental health outcomes in the UK, particularly investigating the most effective way to measure and analyse these outcomes. Currently he is working on evaluating the current methodologies and underlying assumptions used in measuring and quantifying mental health responses in the UK. His previous projects include using developing advanced multilevel methodologies to investigate segregation in UK self-rated health, and multilevel analysis of mental health outcomes across the UK in 2009.

She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

Anthony Peterson, an African American, draws from current research and from conversations with his Anglo American grandchildren to address truths about race in 21st century America.\n\nAnthony Peterson is an African American Army brat who calls Hawaii home. He has lived, studied, written about, and taught about cultural and racial realities. He has developed and facilitated diversity training for corporate and church leaders. His degrees in psychology and religious education add to his perspective. Anthony continues work as an educator, writer and editor in Nashville, Tennessee, where he lives with his wife, Laura. They count six children and nine grandchildren.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California).

                    "description": "As research continues, the term \"bird brain\" no longer carries a negative connotation. Avian researcher John Marzluff showcases a few amazing, problem solving (and sometimes vindictive) feats accomplished by crows in order to break down common misconceptions about avian intelligence. \n\nJohn Marzluff, Ph.D., is the James W. Ridgeway Professor of Wildlife Science at the University of Washington. His research has been the focus of articles in the New York Times, National Geographic, Audubon, Boys Life, The Seattle Times, and National Wildlife. PBS's NATURE featured his raven research in its production, \"Ravens,\" and his crow research in the film documentary, \"A Murder of Crows\". His graduate and initial post-doctoral research focused on the social behavior and ecology of jays and ravens. He was especially interested in communication, social organization, and foraging behavior. His current research brings this behavioral approach to pressing conservation issues including raptor management, management of pest species, and assessment of nest predation.\n\nHis book, In the Company of Crows and Ravens (with Tony Angell, 2005 Yale U. Press) blends biology, conservation, and anthropology to suggest that human and crow cultures have co-evolved. This book won the 2006 Washington State Book Award for general nonfiction. With his wife, Colleen, he has published Dog Days, Raven Nights (2011 Yale University Press), which combines reflection with biology and the recreational pursuit of dog sledding to show how a life in science blooms. Gifts of the Crow (2012 Free Press) applies a neurobiological perspective to understand the amazing feats of corvids. He is a member of the board of editors for Acta Ornithologica, Landscape Ecology and Ecological Applications. Currently leader of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Recovery Team for the critically endangered Mariana Crow, he is also a Fellow of the American Ornithologist's Union.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

And yet, we are wiping out the very animals we should celebrate; we are the flood coming for Noah's Ark. Carl leaves us with a difficult question: Do we have what it takes to let life on earth survive?\n\nCarl Safina\u2019s work has been recognized with MacArthur, Pew, and Guggenheim Fellowships, and his writing has won the Lannan Literary Award and the John Burroughs, James Beard, and George Rabb medals. He has a PhD in ecology from Rutgers University. Safina is the inaugural endowed professor for nature and humanity at Stony Brook University, where he co-chairs the steering committee of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and is founding president of the not-for-profit Safina Center. He hosted the 10-part PBS series Saving the Ocean with Carl Safina. His writing appears in The New York Times, National Geographic, Audubon and other periodicals, and on the Web at National Geographic News and Views, Huffington Post, and CNN.com. Carl Safina\u2019s writing shows how humanity is changing the natural world and what those changes mean for wildlife and for people.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss. Hosted in the St. Regis Hotel Ballroom, Aspen, Colorado.",
