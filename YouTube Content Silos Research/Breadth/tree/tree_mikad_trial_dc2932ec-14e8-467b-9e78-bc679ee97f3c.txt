                    "description": "STUDIES IN PESSIMISM by Arthur Schopenhauer - FULL AudioBook | GreatestAudioBooks.com - Arthur Schopenhauer (22 February 1788 \u2013 21 September 1860) was a German philosopher best known for his book, The World as Will and Representation (German: Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung), in which he claimed that our world is driven by a continually dissatisfied will, continually seeking satisfaction. Independently arriving at many of the same conclusions of Eastern philosophy, he maintained that the \"truth was recognized by the sages of India\"; consequently, his solutions to suffering were similar to those of Vedantic and Buddhist thinkers (e.g., asceticism). The influence of \"transcendental ideality\" led him to choose atheism.\n\nAt age 25, he published his doctoral dissertation, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which examined the four distinct aspects of experience in the phenomenal world; consequently, he has been influential in the history of phenomenology. He has influenced many thinkers, including Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Otto Rank, Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Mann, and Jorge Luis Borges, among others.

                    "description": "http://www.egs.edu  Wendy Brown, Professor of Philosophy at The European Graduate School / EGS. Saas-Fee Switzerland. August 13 2016.\n\nWendy Brown is Professor of Political Science at the University of California Berkeley. Her research interests include the history of political and social theory, Continental philosophy, and critical theory, together with the examination of contemporary capitalism. In her research into the problems that plague contemporary capitalism and neoliberalism, she employs theoretical works of Michel Foucault, Max Weber, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, and Frankfurt school.\n\nIn 1983, Wendy Brown received her doctoral degree from Princetown University. She subsequently taught at the University of California, Santa Cruz and also at Williams College. Since 1999, she has been teaching at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nEdgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge and Politics (2005) consists of seven articles which were all written for some particular occasion. Brown emphasises this trait of her book and claims that \u201csuch occasions mimic, in certain ways, the experience of the political realm: one is challenged to think here, now, about a problem that is set and framed by someone else, and to do so before a particular audience or in dialogue with others not of one\u2019s own choosing.\u201d Every essay in this book begins with a particular problem: what is the relationship between love, loyalty, and dissent in contemporary American political life?; how did neoliberal rationality become a form of governmentality?; what are the main problems of women\u2019s studies programs?, etc. According to Brown, the aim of these essays is not to produce definitive answers to the given questions but \u201cto critically interrogate the framing and naming practices, challenge the dogmas (including those of the Left and of feminism), and discern the constitutive powers shaping the problem at hand.\u201d\n\nIn Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire (2006), Wendy Brown subverts the usual and widely accepted conception that tolerance is one of the most remarkable achievements of the modern Western world. She argues that tolerance cannot be perceived as a complete opposite to violence, but that can also be used to justify violence. In order to substantiate this thesis, Brown associates tolerance with figures like George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Samuel Huntington, Susan Okin, Michael Ignatieff, Bernard Lewis, and Seyla Benhabib and claims that \u201ctolerance as a political practice is always conferred by the dominant, it is always a certain expression of domination even as it offers protection or incorporation to the less powerful.\u201d\n\nWalled States, Waning Sovereignty (2010) examines the revival of wall-building in the contemporary world. She shows that the function of these walls is ultimately problematic because they cannot stop crimes, migration, or smuggling, cannot play a defensive role in the case of a war like they did in the past, and they cannot do anything against potential terrorist attacks. However, even if they cannot stop all these threats, walls still have an important symbolic function which Brown explores in her book.\n\nHer most recent work Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism\u2019s Stealth Revolution (2015) uses Michel Foucault\u2019s The Birth of Biopolitics to analyze the hollowing and evisceration of democracy under neoliberal rationality. Brown describes neoliberalism as a furtive attack on the very foundation of democracy. She treats \u201cneoliberalism as a governing rationality through which everything is \u201ceconomized\u201d and in a very specific way: human beings become market actors and nothing but, every field of activity is seen as a market, and every entity (whether public or private, whether person, business, or state) is governed as a firm. Importantly, this is not merely a matter of extending commodification and monetization everywhere, as in the old Marxist depiction of capital\u2019s transformation of everyday life. Neoliberalism construes even non-wealth generating spheres\u2014such as learning, dating, or exercising\u2014in market terms, submits them to market metrics, and governs them with market techniques and practices. Above all, it casts people as human capital who must constantly tend to their own present and future value.\u201d To be saved, democracy again needs to become not only the object of theoretical rethinking but also of political struggle.",

This logic is even applied to activities with no connection to wealth creation, such as education, dating, or physical exercise, which are increasingly governed according to market rules. People are treated in this schema, as units of human capital who must constantly tend to their own present and future value.",

                    "description": "This summer marks the centennial of the outbreak of World War I, perhaps the most transformative war in history. While the wars of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars harnessed national populations to the war effort in a way not previously seen since the emergence of the modern states system, WWI combined the mobilization of both populations and industrial power, enhanced by technology, to produce a most lethal form of warfare. WWI also redrew the map of Europe and created the modern Middle East, as it led to the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire, thereby unleashing nationalism the disruptive characteristics of which still plague us today. It also paved the way for the great ideological conflicts of the 20th century by unleashing the forces of state-based communism and fascism. To commemorate the outbreak of The Great War, FPRI and ROA will present a workshop offering presentations by three eminent scholars of the war. Michael Neiberg of the US Army War College will discuss the factors that led to the outbreak of the war. John Schindler of the US Naval War College will discuss the often overlooked role of Austria-Hungary in the war and the Eastern and Italian fronts. Kate Epstein of Rutgers University-Camden will discuss the role of pre-war British defense policy in the outbreak of the conflict. Mac Owens, editor of Orbis and professor at the Naval War College, will moderate the panel.",

A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

But he said they have Ukraine to thank for standing up to Russian aggression for years, and protecting the rest of Europe from it.\nStill, Zelenskyy said diplomacy is the only means for Ukraine to regain the territory it lost when Russia attacked in 2014. That led him to question Russian claims that they are not seeking to do so again now.\nChristiane Amanpour was on hand to conduct an in-depth follow-up interview with Zelenskyy.\n\n\nSubscribe: ",

He is the author of over 400 scientific research publications and has trained more than 50 postdoctoral research fellows. He has been a consultant to the National Institutes of Health and numerous pharmaceutical companies in the development of new psychotropic drugs.\n\nDr. Roland Griffiths and I discuss the research with John Hopkins University. We spoke about how he got into psychedelics and convinced ethic committees to approve such research, why he chose the scientific path, specifics about his studies with psilocybin, transformations of cancer patients with family members, the impact of psilocybin in existing institutions, the ongoing studies he is performing with long-time meditators and religious leaders, how the integration of psilocybin into society may look and more.\n\nFind more information about the center for psychedelic and consciousness research at ",

He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.\n\nSowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.\n\nSowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).\n\nRobinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.\n\nInterested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

                "description": "This interview was not conducted to be a stand-alone interview, it was conducted for a Dutch documentary about male/female-dynamics in Canada. Within this documentary, we explored how an event like the Toronto van attack could happen in Canada and how Canadians are trying to heal from it. More broadly, we looked at misogyny and violence against women within Canada, and what it is about contemporary feminism that makes some men angry or lost. We also paid attention to men suffering from violence that their female partners had inflicted upon them. As prominent Canadian voices, we included both Margaret Atwood and Jordan Peterson.\n\nPsychology professor Jordan Peterson has become a controversial figure ever since speaking out against Bill C-16 (2016), a law which adds gender expression and gender identity to the Canadian Human Rights Act. He has received both praise and criticism after the publication of his self-help book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018). His fans are thankful for the advice he\u2019s given them to take responsibility for their lives, his critics argue that his emphasis on the danger posed by \u2018postmodern neo-marxists\u2019 is dangerous in itself. He has been accused of being anti-feminist and feeding into the alt-right. While he gained support among people who do identify with the alt-right, he himself does not. \n\nPeterson has become an important inspiration for various men\u2019s groups, an influential voice. Therefore, we wanted to get clear where he stands on contemporary feminism and how he interprets the van attack, which took place in the city he lives in. Since the documentary episode only allowed for brief passages from the interview, while Peterson\u2019s answers are extensive, we decided to provide the entire interview.\n\nWe talked to Peterson on the 4th of June 2019, in Toronto, Ontario. Since there were some breaks (for adjusting the camera and for having coffee) during the interview, it consists of multiple takes. Apart from leaving out the breaks themselves and making the transition between breaks more fluent, no further editing has been done. \n\nThe documentary about the Toronto van attack and male-female dynamics in Canada is available here: ",

The Federal government, in a website which has since been taken down, stated clearly that this legislation would be interpreted in keeping with the policies of the Ontario Human Rights Commission, which I regard as one of the most dangerous institutions in Canada, in relationship to all rights other than those of \"equality,\" including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association. I was partnered with lawyer Jared Brown, whose courageous and detailed analysis of Bill C16 can be found here: ",

Krauss. Throughout his career, Dr. Krauss has made remarkable contributions to the field of research on particle physics and cosmology. Dr. Krauss formerly worked at Yale University, Case Western Reserve University, and Arizona State University. Dr. Krauss also founded ASU\u2019s Origins Project, a non-profit corporation that holds public panel discussions on science, culture, and social issues. Some of his work includes popular books such as The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing.\n\nJordan and Lawrence sit down to discuss a variety of topics in the mind-boggling world of quantum physics. They spend time discussing generated models of the beginning of our universe, the lawbreaking complexities of quantum physics, the ramifications related to entropy, the usefulness of the scientific method, as well as the instinctive behaviour for religious compulsion among human beings.\n\nThe Jordan B. Peterson Podcast can be found at",

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",
