The forbidden love of the passionate, noble young native and the ambitious soldier of fortune puts the pair at odds with their undeniable obligations to their own people and the inescapable demands of the human heart in the historical adventure epic The New World. Starring Colin Farrell (\"Alexander,\" \"Daredevil\"), Christian Bale (\"Batman Begins,\" \"The Dark Knight\"), Q'orianka Kilcher (\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\") and Golden Globe-nominee and Emmy Award-winner Christopher Plummer (\"Alexander,\" TV's \"Madeline,\" \"American Tragedy\").",

Box-office superstar Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this contemporary science fiction action film set \"\"within the architecture of the mind.\"\" Written, directed and produced by Oscar\u00ae and Golden Globe nominee Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Interstellar, The Prestige), this eagerly awaited follow-up to 2008's billion-dollar blockbuster is yet another visionary tale from a startingly original filmmaker who continually raises the bar with every film he makes. Shooting in London, Paris, Tangiers, Calgary and Los Angeles, Nolan's mind-bending film also stars Academy Award\u00ae winners Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard, in addition to Juno's Elliot Page, Batman Begins' Cillian Murphy and Oscar\u00ae nominees Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) and Tom Berenger (Platoon).",

Go to https://curiositystream.com/thetake and enter the code TheTake for 25% off a year-long subscription.\n\nAs our culture collectively revisits the misogynistic treatment of the Britneys, Parises, and Megans of the 2000s, we have to ask: WHY was this era so deeply toxic for women? A key answer to this question is a thing called \"Postfeminism\": the belief that misogyny and sexism are over, and therefore \u201cfeminism\u201d is no longer necessary.\n\nSurely, many films or shows that can be called \u201cpostfeminist\u201d contain some wonderful complexity, honesty and humor, and there are many people who identify with or take empowerment from postfeminism\u2019s emphasis on individualism and freedom. But those values can\u2019t be a replacement for addressing the structural problems that women continue to face. \n\nSupport The Take:\nShop our Limited Edition Merch: ",

During the extremely needed bath, which she hates, I lost control of her head and she managed to latch onto my arm and break the skin with two teeth. It looked kinda rough, so I figured I should get a tetanus shot in the morning. By the time the clinic opened I was in some of the worst pain of my life, the swollen bite looked like a tennis ball was embedded inside my arm, and the selling was pressing constantly against my ulnar nerve. The pressure was so intense that I could feel gravity pulling on my skin and fingers. Anyway, that's a big part of why this is late.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",

If you are already good, you don't have to do any more good deeds and often don't even notice how bad you actually are. Bertholt Brecht wrote a text about this about 100 years ago \"Verh\u00f6r des Guten\". I tried to translate the text into English and set it to music. Here my first try.\n\n\n\n---lyrics----\nStep forward: We hear\nThat you are a good man.\nYou are not for sale, you can\u2019t be bought like the lightning\nthat strikes the house\nWhat you once said, you\u2019ll stick to it.\nWhat did you say?\nYou are honest, you speak your mind.\nWhat opinion?\nYou are brave.\nAgainst whom?\nYou are wise.\nFor whom?\nYou don\u2019t look at your own profit.\nOn whose then?\nYou are a good friend.\nOf good people too?\nSo listen: We know\nYou are our enemy. That\u2019s why we want to put you\nAgainst a wall now. But considering your merits.\nAnd good qualities\nAgainst a good wall and shoot you with\nGood bullets of good rifles and bury you with\nA good shovel in good ground.\nBertolt Brecht",
