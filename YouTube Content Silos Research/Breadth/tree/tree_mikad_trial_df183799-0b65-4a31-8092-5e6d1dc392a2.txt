Carmakers are forced to sell cars without features like heated seats, considered essential in colder climates. General Motors has been directing the supplies it does have to its most profitable vehicles. And there isn\u2019t really a clear end to this in sight.\n\nGeneral Motors had to temporarily drop heated seats as an option on vehicles in response to the chip shortage. But the largest U.S. automaker is not alone. The move is another sign of how automakers are having to respond to a crisis that has been cratering dealer inventory, spiking prices and delaying orders.\n\nWhile GM does have a proposed remedy in place \u2014 a retrofit option will be available for owners later in 2022 \u2014 there really is no discernible end of the chip shortage in sight. There has been talk of trying to spur more domestic semiconductor production, but that will take years and billions of dollars to get off the ground.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ",

The officers patrolling the road seized 18 tons of drugs last year \u2014 a more than a 300-percent increase from the year before.\n\n\u201cIt's a traditional route for drug traffickers - not just for drugs, but also heavy arms,\u201d Alcino Galvao da Silva, Unit Leader of the Federal Highway Patrol, told VICE News. \u201cMachine guns, bullets, marijuana, and cocaine\u2026 It has grown quite a bit, especially in Rio de Janeiro.\u201d   \n\n\u201cJohnny,\u201d as he asked VICE News to call him, has been dealing drugs for the Third Command drug gang since he was 16 years-old. Now at 28 he manages all the drugs corners in the neighborhood and isn\u2019t afraid to defend them by force. \n\n\u201cI can tell you that today I've got 35 homicides,\u201d \u201cJohnny\u201d told VICE News. \u201cFear? We don't have fear. That's what we're here for. To kill and die. We'll die, but die fighting. It's our war motto: Die fighting.\u201d\n\nBolsonaros plan to \u201cgive guns to good people,\u201d and ramp up the military\u2019s role by giving security forces more power to shoot and kill armed criminals isn\u2019t getting the drug gangs to drop their guns. Third Command says their stockpilling weapons of war. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to take the world into an urban war,\u201d \u201cJohnny\u201d told VICE News. \u201cInstead of us killing the Red Command we\u2019re going to go after the guy who is in the police who listened to one of Bolsonaro's orders.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: ",

Today, fewer than 150 remain. Despite the fact that more than half of current detainees have been cleared for transfer from the base, and in spite of the executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2009 ordering the closure of the prison within one year, there's no indication it will be shuttered anytime soon.\n\nVICE News traveled to Guantanamo to find out what the hell is going on. After a tightly controlled yet bizarre tour of the facility, we sought out a former detainee in Sarajevo and a former guard in Phoenix to get their unfiltered impressions of what life is like at Gitmo.\n\nClick to watch \"Murder, Mayhem, and Meditation\" - ",

That\u2019s the reported price Prince Andrew will pay Virginia Guiffre to settle a very disturbing legal case against him. She says when she was 17 she was trafficked to the Prince by the paedophile businessman Jeffrey Epstein, ably assisted by his sex-offender partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Despite that photo, Andrew denies ever meeting, let alone having sex with Ms Guiffre, but he\u2019s been so discredited, these days it\u2019s difficult to believe anything the disgraced royal says.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

That survivor, Col Ed Carruthers is accused of murdering his fellow crewmen. But Ed claims that the killer was a Martian monster, and hopes to prove his assertions by signing up for a second journey to the Red Planet. Before long, the crew members of this second expedition are being systematically killed off, and it looks as though Ed is up to his old tricks. As it turns out, however, Ed was telling the truth: there is a monster on board, the savage descendant of the once-mighty Martian civilization, who snuck on board when an irresponsible crew member left the door open. The monster stays alive by absorbing the vital body fluids of its victims-and there seems to be no way to stop this parasitic creature.",

Some countries, like Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, have grappled with depression or recession for years and still suffer from unacceptably high unemployment, especially among young people. Practically on the whole continent, economic underperformance, coupled with rising inequality, brought political and social uncertainty. This toxic mixture threatens the integrity of the EU as a whole, causing frustration amongst citizens, and encouraging populist movements around Europe. Against this backdrop, the EU\u2019s political leadership cannot continue with a business-as-usual approach. \nIn his recent report, Joseph Stiglitz outlines a new set of rules for economic, political, and social governance in Europe that would help to recast a prosperous and equitable EU marked by peace and solidarity within the context of globalization. To improve economic performance and create shared prosperity, the rules of the European economy \u2013 broadly understood the fundamental policies governing the EU \u2013 must be rewritten. \n\n\nThe discussion will be held in English.\n\nIn cooperation with the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS), the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), and WU Vienna ",

With their current decisions, they are jeopardizing public health, public goods and the interests of Europeans. \n\nWe call it TV because we like retro-futurism. But it's much more than TV.

Can this popular uprising break the neoliberal grip on the state and create lasting structural change that will empower the disenfranchised?\n\nJoin us as the Former Finance Minister of Greece and founder of the Democracy in Europe Movement 25 (DiEM25) explores what a restructured economic and political landscape might look like in a post pandemic era, and what it would take to harness state power in service of the masses rather than corporations.\n\nYanis Varoufakis is an economist, philosopher, and politician. He is a member of the Hellenic Parliament, Secretary-General of MeRA25, co-founder of DiEM25, and the former finance minister of Greece. Together with Bernie Sanders he co-founded Progressive International, to unite progressives around the world. He has taught economics at the University of Cambridge and the University Texas, Austin, and is the author of several books, including Adults in the Room, And The Weak Suffer What They Must, and The Global Minotaur.",

While the wars of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars harnessed national populations to the war effort in a way not previously seen since the emergence of the modern states system, WWI combined the mobilization of both populations and industrial power, enhanced by technology, to produce a most lethal form of warfare. WWI also redrew the map of Europe and created the modern Middle East, as it led to the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire, thereby unleashing nationalism the disruptive characteristics of which still plague us today. It also paved the way for the great ideological conflicts of the 20th century by unleashing the forces of state-based communism and fascism. To commemorate the outbreak of The Great War, FPRI and ROA will present a workshop offering presentations by three eminent scholars of the war. Michael Neiberg of the US Army War College will discuss the factors that led to the outbreak of the war. John Schindler of the US Naval War College will discuss the often overlooked role of Austria-Hungary in the war and the Eastern and Italian fronts. Kate Epstein of Rutgers University-Camden will discuss the role of pre-war British defense policy in the outbreak of the conflict. Mac Owens, editor of Orbis and professor at the Naval War College, will moderate the panel.",

He is currently a Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the New School University in New York City. He wrote Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism and founded www.democracyatwork.info, a non-profit advocacy organization of the same name that promotes democratic workplaces as a key path to a stronger, democratic economic system.\n\nProfessor Wolff discusses the economic dimensions of our lives, our jobs, our incomes, our debts, those of our children, and those looming down the road in his unique mixture of deep insight and dry humor. He presents current events and draws connections to the past to highlight the machinations of our global economy. He helps us to understand political and corporate policy, organization of labor, the distribution of goods and services, and challenges us to question some of the deepest foundations of our society.

He breaks down the martial arts prowess of stars such as Brad Pitt in \"Troy\" (2004), Orlando Bloom in \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005), and Russell Crowe in \"Gladiator\" (2000).\n\nHe also looks at some fantastical scenes such as the battle of Helm's Deep from \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" (2002) and the battle of Winterfell from \"Game of Thrones.\" Konijnendijk analyzes the historical accuracy of scenes from \"The Last Kingdom\" (2015) and \"Red Cliff\" (2008), and he rates the realism of the military formations, tactics, movements, and weaponry of each scene.\n\nFind out more about Konijnendijk here: ",

        "description": "Yanis Varoufakis and Gilian Tett came to the Intelligence Squared stage in a conversation chaired by Anne McElvoy, to debate whether capitalism is broken and if it needs to be fixed. Tett and Varoufakis both agree that the current model of capitalism needs to change  but they differ radically in the solutions they proffer. \n\nGillian Tett is the pioneering columnist who has spent the last decade documenting the rise of \u2018conscious capitalism\u2019, a movement led by businesses that have concluded they can no longer afford to ignore issues like climate change, income inequality and social justice. Yanis Varoufakis is the former Greek finance minister who oversaw the bailout crisis in 2015 and has spent the last decade calling for a kinder vision for the global economy.\n\nIs capitalism past its sell by date? Or can it be reinvented for the digital age?\n\nAbout Intelligence Squared: \n\nIntelligence Squared has established itself as the leading forum for live, agenda-setting debates, talks and discussions around the world.\n\nOur aim is to promote a global conversation that enables people to make informed decisions about the issues that matter, in the company of the world's greatest minds and orators.\n\nClick here to subscribe on Apple Podcasts and receive our audio podcasts as soon as they are released: ",
