A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

Yes, if you believe the man you're about to meet. Richard Godfrey is no crackpot; he's a respected British aerospace engineer and physicist who says he's found the doomed airliner. If he's right, he'll provide desperately needed answers for the families of the 239 passengers and crew who were aboard the Boeing triple-seven when it vanished eight years ago. But knowing where it is isn't the end of the story - Richard also has to convince authorities to resume the search that's already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

This one tells so many more. We\u2019ll never know for sure, but it\u2019s also probably worth about $20 million. That\u2019s the reported price Prince Andrew will pay Virginia Guiffre to settle a very disturbing legal case against him. She says when she was 17 she was trafficked to the Prince by the paedophile businessman Jeffrey Epstein, ably assisted by his sex-offender partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Despite that photo, Andrew denies ever meeting, let alone having sex with Ms Guiffre, but he\u2019s been so discredited, these days it\u2019s difficult to believe anything the disgraced royal says.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",
