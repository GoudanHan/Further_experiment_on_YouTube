At least 170 people have been arrested as part of the convoy crackdown and Ottawa\u2019s police chief warned their investigation into others involved will continue for many months. David Akin has more from Parliament Hill.\n\nThe streets in Ottawa are starting to look more bare and normal. Sean O\u2019Shea has more from the midst of that police operation.\n\nFrom protesters to police, officers appeared to be shifting strategy today as they work to clear the remaining protesters from the area. The slow methodical approach that we saw from police yesterday seemed to be replaced with a much tougher line today. Mercedes Stephenson has more on the police tactics used today.\n\nTo the escalating tensions in Ukraine and a new show of force from Vladimir Putin. The Russian president oversaw large-scale nuclear drills today. And as Reggie Cecchini reports, it comes as Ukraine\u2019s president issues a desperate plea to western allies. \n\nGeorge Floyd\u2019s murder in the summer of 2020 sparked a global outcry over systemic racial inequality including Black employees in corporate Canada. A new survey sheds light on how their situation is changing. Anne Gaviola reports.\n \nNorthern British Columbia is a world away from Syria, but it\u2019s a place one Syrian refugee is proud to call home. To express his gratitude he\u2019s giving back to his community. Jay Durant has his story.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",

                "description": "The Case of Russell Williams done in a JCS style format. I hope you enjoy it! \n\nSummary:\n\nThe tragic events surrounding Colonel Russell Williams stunned all Canadians and none more so than the members of the Canadian Forces.\n\nIn October of 2009, Russell Williams was a 46-year-old commander of the largest and highest functioning air force base in Canada. Williams was a model military man and highly respected by his peers. \n\nHe had been described as an elite pilot over the course of his 23-year career. He had flown Queen Elizabeth, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Governor General of Canada, the Prime Minister of Canada, and many other dignitaries in the Canadian Forces VIP aircraft.\n\nHe seemed to be the perfect example of a military leader, but something sinister and deadly was lurking deep within him. In October of 2010, he pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of sexual assault and confinement, and 82 other counts of break and enter, and theft. \n\nWhen that news came out, it made the headlines across Canada and around the world for months; a man that Canada had placed in a senior position of trust and authority turned out to have a dark secret life as a deviant killer. \n\nOn February 7, 2010, Williams was asked to be present at the Ottawa Police Service headquarters.\n\nEven 10 years after the interrogation took place at the Ottawa police headquarters, the Russell Williams interrogation video still packs a massive punch. It captures a vividly emotional and intellectual game of cat and mouse between a seasoned investigator and a powerful yet terrifying man who is slowly realizing that his game is up, and there is no room to maneuver.\n\nCredits:\n\nMusic:\nLemmino",

Millions of young teenage boys and some in their 20s adopted the sport and it looked like it was headed for the Olympics. ESPN2 began to run extreme sport competitions including one with aggressive skaters. Neda Gane, a passionate aggressive in-line skater, was a rare breed in the world of skating at that time. Very few women took up the sport. Late one night at 1 AM in the morning outside of an LA party of skaters, one of my colleagues did this interview with her. We were making a feature-length documentary film on the sport and its competitors in LA and New York. The finished film titled is It's All Good is now considered a classic look of the sport and some of its biggest stars. Whatever sport you love  either as an athlete or as a spectator, to hear from a person as passionate and articulate as Neda was is a thrill to me as a documentary filmmaker because at its core, it's that passion that gets athletes to go beyond what is possible and demonstrate pure excellence.",

A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",
