                "description": "Being a professional drummer or performer is the dream of so many people around the world but for members of Kodo (\u9f13\u7ae5), it's a reality. Their career is Taiko Drumming as a performance art, on tour around the world. When they're at home on Sado Island, they're practicing which is more like living and working. Kodo is not just a place to learn Taiko drums. It's not just a school. It's a place where you learn life's most important lessons, build a connection with nature and become someone greater than before - a leader - which is part of their grueling 2-year apprentice program. \nThe dream of making the taiko drum a career is real for the group of dreamers who formed Kodo in 1981. \n\nThis is the story of Kodo and the journey of their lives in the pursuit of the perfect beat.

            "description": "In Japan, cleaning is more than a job, it's part of the culture, like an art. Anyone who has been to Tokyo knows it's one of the cleanest cities in the world and to keep it that way, it takes a team of dedicated professionals who are often un-noticed - meaning they're doing an excellent job! \nWe'll take a detailed look at how JR East Environment Access (JEA) keeps JR Ueno Station super clean and safe for the 180,000 daily passengers and it's a microcosm of how the entire city stays so clean. \nUeno Station is a stop for the Shinkansen and platform 13 1/2 is where the Train Suite Shiki-Shima departs. The jingles and melodies you'll hear throughout the station, the announcements and trains rolling through is super nostalgic. I filmed this starting in January 2021 and finished the final scene a year later. ",

A full day following a Japanese Aerospace Engineer starting with him waking up in his Tokyo home with his Japanese family.  Takashi is a Japanese husband and Japanese father taking care of his family in Japan.  He lives in an average Japanese apartment in Tokyo and we get a peek into a day in his life in Japan.  As a Japanese dad, he has a 4 year old Japanese kid and he balances his Japan worklife with Japan homelife.  Takashi would be considered a Japanese salaryman as he has fairly standard working hours at Astroscale as a Space Engineer in Tokyo Japan.   on this day, we get to see his working hours in Japan.  In addition to working on the ELSA-d project, he also has worked with JAXA on other missions.  JAXA stands for Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and is the Japanese national aerospace and space agency.  During the day, Takashi also visits Gitai, a space robotics company and meets with several Japanese robotics engineers.  We even get a chance to explore the office and see Japanese built robots being designed for space.\n\nWatch more Japan Day in the Life Series (Playlist):\n- ",

This is a day in the life of Japanese worker, Makoto, 27 years old who lives in a Tokyo 3-story house with his family.  This Tokyo salaryman works in a small Tokyo office, but spends many of his Japan working hours traveling from client to client on the Tokyo trains.  Makoto works for a company called Mobal and as many Japanese salarymen, he entered the company straight from a Japanese University and he plans to spend his entire salaryman career at the same company.  That is the life in Japan for a salaryman.  We take a look inside what it's like to work in a small Tokyo office as well as to visit clients throughout Tokyo city area.  His job experiences maybe unique to his company, but fundamentally he is very much an average salaryman.  He commutes by train everyday to get to work and has to ride his mama-chari bike to get to the train station from his home.   This Tokyo salaryman life has him arriving to work early and working late.  As a salaryman, Makoto receives a standard salary every month for all the long work hours.  The Japanese office is also configured so his boss' desk is right in front of him, quite a Japanese style office working environment.  This very average Japanese work day and work lifestyle showcases a true day in Japan work life.    \n\nMobal\n- ",

This is also a tour of her Japanese office, Pasona.  We start this typical day in her Japanese home, commute via train to her Tokyo office in Otemachi and spend a day in the life of Emi at her working place.  We see her typical working hours in Japan and how it is working in Japan as a female in her position.  Her day in the life in Japan may be a bit different than some Japanese salarymen, but her experiences in the office with chorei, senpai / kouhai, and kenshu is a very typical in experiences in many Japanese offices.  If you want to know how work in Japan or want to know how work in Tokyo, this could be how your job in Japan could be like.  The Tokyo office itself, is probably an above average Japanese office in terms design and the business culture a bit more progressive than most traditional Japanese companies, but this Japanese company still maintains a very traditional Japanese office environment.  So all in all, this is an example of Japan life as well as Tokyo life if you were to work in a Japanese company.  You should always be aware of Japanese culture when working in a Japanese office.  This Japanese office has a gym, English school and even a farm all in the building.  Pasona is one of the largest staffing services company in Japan.  There\u2019s about 4000 staff in her office alone and about 9000 in total worldwide.  \n\nMy Day in the Life Series Playlist",

This is life in Tokyo and life in Japan as an aspiring manga artists living with other mangaka in the same home.  Nobi, 25 years old lives in the outskirts of Tokyo. Now living in this unique shared house reserved for only aspiring Manga artists.  He lives with 3 other mangaka under this special program called Tokiwaso which provides a living space in addition to support to help develop a manga artist\u2019s career.  We follow his daily routine from when he wakes up in the morning in his Japanese home, what his life is like working in Japan as manga artist as well as what he does at night living in Japan.  As an aspiring manga artist, his daily schedule varies quite a bit as he has the freedom to dictate his working hours, whether it be spending all his waking moments developing his craft or taking it easy to follow other pursuits.  At the end of the day, Nobi knows it\u2019s his personal responsibility to guide his success in becoming a professional mangaka so he puts in the time everyday to create as many opportunities for himself as possible. \n\nNobi Ketaro\nTwitter @Ryoken_mth",

Over the years I\u2019ve come across some Japanese laws that aren\u2019t completely obvious, especially to visitors so I thought I\u2019d make this fun video and share it with all of you.  In fact, these Japanese laws are stuff that many Japanese consider manners or common sense, but they\u2019ve taken it one step further and made it official law just in case someone decides to go against the grain. Whether or not the Japanese authorities decide to arrest someone or prosecute though maybe a different story, but nonetheless these laws may be one of the reasons why things in Japan stay in order.  Many of the items shared in the video fall under Japanese \u8efd\u72af\u7f6a\u6cd5, Keihan zaihou or the minor crime law which is sometimes explained as \"a law that stipulates the minimum level of morality that citizens should observe in their daily lives and it targets \"bad acts\" that are often seen in daily life.  All minor crime law violators could face a fine between about $10 to $100 and or jail time of 1 to 30 days. \n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- ",

Thanks to Squarespace, get 10% Off: https://www.squarespace.com/paolofrom...\nThe Japanese justice system and Japanese laws are stricter than many countries and sometimes lead to foreigner arrests in Japan simply because foreigners are unaware of Japan laws and Japan justice system.  The Japanese judicial system has 99% conviction rate in Japan so foreigners should be mindful and aware how strict Japan laws and rules are.  Japanese Police arrests tourist in Japan or Japan Police arrest foreigners in Japan when they are under suspicion of a crime.  Suspects will be brought into police custody to be interrogated for 3 days and if the Japanese police are still not satisfied, the police can request for additional detainment for up to 23 days total, without the suspect being officially charged with a crime in Japan.  In this video, I interview a Japanese Trial Lawyer, Yugo Ishibashi, to help me understand the Japanese justice system as well as to share with foreigners and tourists how Japanese law works in Japan and maybe gain some insight on what options a foreigner has if arrested in Japan.  Japanese police interrogation is quite stressful and Yugo mentions that sometimes suspects plead guilty even though they didn't commit the crime due to the pressure of the Japanese police interrogation.   If suspects don't plead guilty to the crime, it may be possible to be detained for more than a year until the suspect confess to a crime.  This is sometimes referred to as Hostage Justice in Japan.  Convicted persons will end up in Japanese Jail and Japanese prison.  This video should help educate tourist visiting Japan and foreigners living in Japan to help ensure that they are aware of how strict Japanese laws are so that they are careful to not violate the laws when they are in Japan.  But keep in mind that these laws are one of the reasons why Japan is so safe compared to many other countries.  This video is not to deter foreigners or tourists from visiting Japan, but they should just be aware of Japanese laws and the risks when breaking laws in Japan like graffiti in japan or fighting in japan.  \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer.

We get a glimpse of Japanese work culture and Japan working hours for a Japanese automobile mechanic.  This life in Japan, follows Yuya from morning until evening to show what a typically does before and after working at the Japanese truck garage.  \n\nYuta works as a SEIBISHI, in English, Mechanic.

These days, they\u2019re best known for their commercial vehicles like trucks and buses.

Yes, if you believe the man you're about to meet. Richard Godfrey is no crackpot; he's a respected British aerospace engineer and physicist who says he's found the doomed airliner. If he's right, he'll provide desperately needed answers for the families of the 239 passengers and crew who were aboard the Boeing triple-seven when it vanished eight years ago. But knowing where it is isn't the end of the story - Richard also has to convince authorities to resume the search that's already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

This is how everything related to a Shinkansen and bullet trains are made in Japan.  The JR Central Hamamatsu Workshop started as a repair shop in 1912 for steam locomotives and over time as technology evolved, so did the workshop servicing trains across the ages from electric locomotives, electric trains and now shinkansen. Today there are a total of about 1300 hardworking JR central staff and affiliated workers who come together at the factory to ensure that all their shinkansen trains are operating at peak performance and safety.  In order to maintain and service the Shinkansen, the workers must be taken it apart section by section and then piece by piece as each must go through a strict and rigorous inspection process.  This requires for each piece to be transported to various areas of the plant so different teams can work on the different sections simultaneously, hence the requirement for so much space. In fact, the workers are divided into 4 teams - body, parts, undercarriage and inspection.  Each worker, required to master a unique set of skills for their section before being allowed to service the train.  The Hamamatsu Workshop Factory works on, up to 4 Shinkansen at one time. In fact, they inspect and repair about 50 Shinkansen, 800 carriages, each year!  And each train must pass 4 levels of periodic inspection, with each level becoming more exhaustive. Inspections are performed every 48 hours, then every 60,000km about 45 days, after that every 600,000km about 18 months and finally at 1.2Million km or every 36 months, which again is the most detailed inspection as it\u2019s a complete teardown, repair and rebuild taking about 14 days to fully complete and the very inspection that I\u2019m showing you today.\n\n*Correction the undercarriage is tested at 186mph not 806mph.\n\nJR Tokai \n- ",

Get your first month FREE with any Kiwico Subscription: https://www.kiwico.com/JerryRig  This day has been in the works for a very long time. I started taking apart my Military Hummer January of 2021, and here we are taking it for a spin with its electric motors in February of 2022. A full year of hard work and learning later. Thank you for joining me on this adventure! Its been super fun and we have a lot more work to do! Should we add some Solar panels to the top?! I think so. \n\nGrab your Whisper Project shirt (since its not a Hummer any more) here: ",
