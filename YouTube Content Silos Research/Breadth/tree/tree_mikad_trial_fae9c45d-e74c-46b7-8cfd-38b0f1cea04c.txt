Despite having incredibly uncontroversial content, she's managed to find herself on the political TikTok battlefield every couple of months for the last three years. It began with simple complaints about hate comments, and has since escalated to the point where OnlyJayus cannot even make a simple joke without being cancelled, along the way having beefed with creators like Acrello, AuntKaren0, PapaGut, and TheJonathanMoss. This video will cover that transition, and in the process, explain how OnlyJayus became TikTok's most hated creator.\n\nThis is, How OnlyJayus Became TikTok\u2019s Most Hated Creator.\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2 XO \u2764\n\nThis video was heavily inspired by Bills \"The Downfall Of OnlyJayus: The Most Hated Content Creator On TikTok!\", big thanks to him, you can watch his version here: ",

He has been a consultant to the National Institutes of Health and numerous pharmaceutical companies in the development of new psychotropic drugs.\n\nDr. Roland Griffiths and I discuss the research with John Hopkins University. We spoke about how he got into psychedelics and convinced ethic committees to approve such research, why he chose the scientific path, specifics about his studies with psilocybin, transformations of cancer patients with family members, the impact of psilocybin in existing institutions, the ongoing studies he is performing with long-time meditators and religious leaders, how the integration of psilocybin into society may look and more.\n\nFind more information about the center for psychedelic and consciousness research at ",

Having grown up in a violent household, he knew firsthand how important it was for men to have a place where they could be heard, a place where they could be truly seen. In this raw, emotional and unflinching talk, Matt shares what he learned from more than 25,000 hours of talking to men\u2014and letting them be their true selves. Watch all the way to the end for a powerful tribute from some of the people whose lives he's touched. Matt Brown is an internationally acclaimed barber and hair artist, author, husband, and father of three known for \u2018giving great cuts\u2019 and \u2018inspiring great men.\u2019 He is a survivor of family and childhood sexual abuse and shares his story with the men who frequent his busy Christchurch-based shop, My Fathers Barbers, as a way to foster vulnerability, healing, and connection.\n\nMatt started his business with a simple set up in a garden shed; as his talent and client list steadily grew, he gained a large following on social media, which he now uses to share messages of inspiration and overcoming. \n\nIn 2018, Matt partnered with the Ministry of Social Development for their \u2018It\u2019s not OK campaign\u2019 to increase awareness about the role of barbers in creating safe spaces that allow men to talk. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

Nathaniel A. Turner was born and raised in Gary, Indiana.  Despite graduating in the bottom quarter of his high school class from one of the worst and most impoverished school systems in the country, Nate went on to earn several degrees.  Nate holds a Bachelors (Accounting), a Masters (Theology & History), and a Juris Doctorate degree.\nNate is an entrepreneur and has operated a financial services practice for two decades.  Not withstanding his professional accomplishments, Nate's greatest passion is helping children realize what he rarely experienced growing up in Gary: feeling valued as a human being and knowing his life had a purpose.Today, Nate's counsel and advice are included on his blog \"The Raising Supaman Project\", his radio show \"The Road Less Traveled\", and in his books \"Raising Supaman\" and \"Stop The Bus\".  Nate encourages parents, guardians, and the community to raise children to become great world citizens and he challenges us all to maximize our abilities to their fullest potential.

Through his talk, he walks through what it took to grow Lyrical Lemonade into what it is today along with how he navigated the music world. His talk emphasizes why having a passion for what you do can change the game and bring you success no matter the obstacle.  As CEO of Lyrical Lemonade, Cole Bennett has produced some of hip hop\u2019s most viewed videos.  Entrepreneur Cole Bennett is not afraid to confront risks to move ideas and creative expression forward. Growing up in Plano IL, Cole enjoyed bringing ideas to life. Whether, creating comics or making skits with friends, he always loved to create. At 17 years old and a senior in high school, Cole produced his first music video. Discovering this deep passion, he founded Lyrical Lemonade while still in high school. After graduation, Cole moved to Chicago to attend DePaul University and further chase his dreams for Lyrical Lemonade. Cole\u2019s dreams quickly became an undeniable reality that led him to dropout of college. His imprint, Lyrical Lemonade, is now a multi-faceted company that specializes in visual content, live events, high demand merchandise and more. At the age of 22, Cole has now directed over 300 music videos for some of the most influential artists that have amassed over 2.8 billion views. Cole has been featured in major publications such as Rolling Stone, Forbes, XXL, and Billboard Magazine.  As the Summer approaches, Bennett is exploring another adventure - preparing to enter the beverage business with his very own lemonade. The lemonade launch is just in time for the second annual Lyrical Lemonade Summer Smash, a hip hop music festival expected to bring together 20,000 people in Douglas Park, Chicago.

He believes that we all benefit from increasing the everyday possibilities to articulate those feelings that are far too often left internalised. Don\u2019t miss this incredibly personal talk in which Gareth shares his story of his battle with depression during his time as an undergraduate student, how he found the space to talk, and how he recovered from this low point through helping others to find that space too. You can continue the conversation with him on Twitter: @Garethjgriffith Gareth Griffith is an Advanced Quantitative Methods PhD student at the University of Bristol. He is interested in all things Mental Health, Wellbeing, Quantitative Methods and Social Inequality. His research focuses on using advanced statistical methodologies to address inequality in mental health outcomes in the UK, particularly investigating the most effective way to measure and analyse these outcomes. Currently he is working on evaluating the current methodologies and underlying assumptions used in measuring and quantifying mental health responses in the UK. His previous projects include using developing advanced multilevel methodologies to investigate segregation in UK self-rated health, and multilevel analysis of mental health outcomes across the UK in 2009.

What is causing the rise of violence and are our current fears and solutions just making it worse?  My name is Aaron stark. I am 39 years old with 4 children, 2 cats, one dog, and a beautiful wife. I am a stay at home dad; my wife is the breadwinner of the family. I am a comic book fan, a pop culture junkie, and a lover of the sciences. I have more knowledge about superheros, pro wrestling, and comedy than anyone really has a right to. After growing up in very abusive and violent circumstances followed by over a decade if personal recovery, I am now a happy family man. I recently shred a very personal story of my triumph over my past, and it has changed my life forever. My mission is to let people know that no matter how dark it may seem, there is light coming.

She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye\u2019s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.",

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

The Federal government, in a website which has since been taken down, stated clearly that this legislation would be interpreted in keeping with the policies of the Ontario Human Rights Commission, which I regard as one of the most dangerous institutions in Canada, in relationship to all rights other than those of \"equality,\" including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association.

Craig is one of the world\u2019s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the \u201cnew atheism\u201d movement. \n\nIn front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christ\u2019s resurrection. It was a compelling clash of worldviews and an examination of the major arguments for and against Christianity and atheism.",

In the video, Williams analyzes scenes where money is being laundered through businesses. Another form of money laundering is simply spending more than $10,000 of illegally-obtained funds. \n\nWilliams served as an FBI special agent for 26 years, working on major economic fraud investigations. She is the recipient of four United States Attorney Awards for Distinguished Service. She now hosts the true-crime podcast \"FBI Retired Case File Review\" and works as a technical consultant for TV shows and movies depicting the FBI. \n\nWilliams is the author of \"FBI Myths and Misconceptions: A Manual for Armchair Detectives\": ",
