Day was a true pioneer of public television: co-founder of KQED in San Francisco, president of WNET upon the merger of National Educational Television (NET) and television station WNDT/Channel 13, and most recently, Chairman of the CUNY TV Advisory Board. The series features fascinating interviews with notable cultural and political figures conducted in the mid 1970's.\n\nJames Day died on April 24, 2008, at age 89. After hosting DAY AT NIGHT, he was appointed Professor of Radio and Television at CUNY's Brooklyn College in 1976, and was named Professor Emeritus upon his retirement in 1988. In 2000, CUNY TV named him Chairman of its Advisory Board. Day - a founder of INPUT, an international conference of public television broadcasters - also was host of \"The Global Tube,\" a multi-year series on CUNY TV that presented notable television films from around the world.\n\nThis edition was taped February 19, 1974.\n\nWatch more at ",

He talks about God and religion, the recession, addiction, famine and plenty more.\n\nNo copyright infringement intended. Ricky is simply too funny to pass off and other videos of this show on YouTube had shitty video and/or audio quality, so I took it upon myself to upload a proper one. English subtitles included in captions. So sue me.",

Krauss. Throughout his career, Dr. Krauss has made remarkable contributions to the field of research on particle physics and cosmology. Dr. Krauss formerly worked at Yale University, Case Western Reserve University, and Arizona State University. Dr. Krauss also founded ASU\u2019s Origins Project, a non-profit corporation that holds public panel discussions on science, culture, and social issues. Some of his work includes popular books such as The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing.\n\nJordan and Lawrence sit down to discuss a variety of topics in the mind-boggling world of quantum physics. They spend time discussing generated models of the beginning of our universe, the lawbreaking complexities of quantum physics, the ramifications related to entropy, the usefulness of the scientific method, as well as the instinctive behaviour for religious compulsion among human beings.\n\nThe Jordan B. Peterson Podcast can be found at",

                    "description": "The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza presented an engaging program featuring renowned forensic pathologist, consultant and author Dr. Cyril H. Wecht. In this two-part presentation, Museum Curator Stephen Fagin led Dr. Wecht in conversation on his remarkable career and longtime interest in the assassination. Wecht then delivered a multimedia lecture on key areas of the Warren Commission\u2019s 1964 investigation, including President Kennedy\u2019s autopsy and the controversial single bullet theory. \n\nDr. Wecht began researching the Kennedy assassination when he was invited to speak before the 1965 meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. More than half a century later, Wecht continues to lecture and give media interviews on the assassination. As a distinguished elder statesman of the assassination research community and current chairman of the Citizens Against Political Assassinations organization, Wecht remains an outspoken critic of the Warren Commission\u2019s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. \n\nThis video contains adult language and graphic imagery which may be disturbing. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nThis presentation took place on April 11, 2017.

He speaks  about what it means to question the status quo of leadership in order to address the most pressing issues of our time.  \n\nAuthor of the New York Times bestseller \u201cInner Engineering, A Yogi\u2019s Guide to Joy,\u201d Sadhguru is an influential voice on issues of inclusive economics, social revitalization, education, and environmental health.  Not relying on specific strategies and techniques, Sadhguru speaks about cultivating leadership as an innate, intuitive process creating a pure inner balance and an insightful mind.\n\nIn 1992, Sadhguru founded Isha Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of humanity, supported by over nine million volunteers world-wide.  His recent \u201cRally For Rivers\u201d campaign in India garnered support of more than 162 million people - making it the single largest ecological movement that the world has seen to date.",

Sadhguru speaks about how individuals can create a quality of inclusiveness within them. Elaborating on how that can impact our work places, homes and communities, he provides practical thoughts and tools on how to create a more inclusive consciousness which he says is the most important aspect that\u2019s needed in the world today.\n\nWith many recent tragic events at home and around the world, there is a deep concern and yearning for us to prevent more tragedies and find solutions to problems that appear to be outside what our two hands can do. Sadhguru has established an infrastructure for developing human consciousness and fostering global harmony through individual transformation.  He refers to this as \u201cInner Engineering\u201d and will dive deeper into the mechanics of how one can bring balance to the mind, body, emotions and energy.  Millions of people across the globe have been touched by his Inner Engineering programs whereby they experientially feel connected to the people around them in ways they had never felt before.\n\nGet his book here: ",

Reunited with her Lili director Charles Walters and screenwriter Helen Deutsch, Caron moves from sooty drudge to radiant belle of the ball with pluck, resourcefulness and the aid of a loopy -- and larcenous -- fairy godmother (the delightful Estelle Winwood). Cinderella's transformation is everything a young girl's heart could desire. But the grandest magic is saved for two Roland Petit ballets that Caron, joined by the Ballet de Paris, turns into extravagant on-screen joy. For witty, family-friendly enchantment, The Glass Slipper is a perfect fit.",

The recording of We Are The World 25 For Haiti embodied the same enthusiasm, sense of purpose and generosity as the original recording 25 years ago. Every one of the artists who participated, regardless of genre or generation, walked into the room with their hearts and souls completely open to coming together to help the people of Haiti.",

Stylish and cool Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) is in Los Angeles as well for the holiday season, but he's not there to give out presents. He's there to take more than $600 million in negotiable bearer bonds from the multinational Nakatomi Corporation, where McClane's wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is an executive. When the takeover becomes hostile, it's up to John McClane to take on the terrorists with all the grit and determination he can muster--but not without a sense of humor.",

When Luke Jackson (Newman) is sentenced to a Southern prison for a minor infraction, his intelligence, calm under pressure and inability to accept defeat soon gain him the respect of his fellow inmates on the chain gang--and the nickname Cool Hand Luke. But they also earn Luke the enmity of the warden, who cannot allow any inmate to challenge his authority. When Luke's mother dies, he decides to escape ... and he will not allow anyone to stop him.",
