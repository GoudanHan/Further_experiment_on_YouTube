                    "description": "Ensemble Polymnia conducted by Sarah Bisley.\nPerformed on  27th September 2015 at St Matthew-in-the-City, Auckland, New Zealand. \nLive recording by Franco Viganoni, www.viganoni.com.\n\nPyotr Ilyich TCHAIKOVSKY (1840-1893) \nSymphonies No. 5 in E Minor and No. 6 in  B minor, the \u201cPath\u00e9tique\u201d, are Tchaikovsky\u2019s mature works, composed in 1888 and 1893\nrespectively. In 1893 he was in his prime, enjoying worldly success and adoration, yet within a matter of days after the premiere of\nhis final symphony he was dead - in circumstances as mysterious and tragic as that of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nTchaikovsky\u2019s achievement in musical history is to have shaped a profound and lasting musical idiom, which was rooted in Russian orthodoxy and became foremost in both Russian and\nWestern Romantic music. To Igor Stravinsky, he was \u201cthe most\nRussian of us all\u201d; \u201chis own character so uncannily reflecting the\nintrospective, darkly brooding richly emotional qualities which have\ncome to characterize Russian music\u2026\u201d (Anthony Holden).\n\nBorn in the Eastern Ural Mountains, and having started life as a civil\nservant in St Petersburg, Tchaikovsky was fortunate in the patronage of two brothers who gave him lifelong support and promoted his works.They were Anton Rubinstein, who founded the St Petersburg Conservatory, and his brother Nikolay, who provided Pyotr Ilyich with protection and employment at his newly-founded Moscow Conservatory. Mihaly Balakirev, one of \u201cthe Five\u201d, also played an important part in Tchaikovsky\u2019s formation as a composer. \nTribute must be made to Nadezdha von Meck, Tchaikovsky\u2019s unfailing patroness and confidante from 1877, thanks to whom he was able to become the first professional composer in Russia.\n\nSymphony No. 5 was first performed at the Mariinsky Theatre, St\nPetersburg on 17th November 1888, with the composer conducting.\nIn his own notes about this work, and although he claimed that the\npiece had \u201cno programme\u201d, Tchaikovsky made jottings showing that\nthe symphony had been inspired by feelings of \u201cMurmurs, doubts,\nlament, reproaches\u2026\u201d which had been haunting him for months,\ntogether with his self-confessed preoccupation with Fate. What is now thought to have been a fairly self-indulgent way of life in his younger days as a homosexual, seems to have become a source of torment to him in his middle years. To quote Vladimir Ashkenazy, \u201cIt is a terrible irony that so much suffering and torment bequeathed us so much wonderful music.\u201d\n\nYet in the same breath, and referring to the Allegro con anima\nfollowing the dark and brooding opening Andante of the first\nmovement, the composer poses the question, \u201cShall I cast myself into the embrace of Faith?\u201d Although what we might call the opening \u201cFate\u201d theme comes back to haunt us again and again, recalled in every movement of the Symphony, there is nevertheless an incredible Romantic yearning for life and an expression of feeling which shine through its creator, and are our priceless treasure.",

In France, he was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1903. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent eschewing of tonality. The French literary style of his period was known as Symbolism, and this movement directly inspired Debussy both as a composer and as an active cultural participant.\n\n(",

Craig is one of the world\u2019s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the \u201cnew atheism\u201d movement. \n\nIn front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christ\u2019s resurrection. It was a compelling clash of worldviews and an examination of the major arguments for and against Christianity and atheism.",

Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he\u2019s saved their lives, and detractors say that he\u2019s the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?\n\nFeaturing Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss. Hosted in the St. Regis Hotel Ballroom, Aspen, Colorado.",

                    "description": "Green Beret David Christian was unquestionably a war hero in the Vietnam war and as he says, fought valiantly on behalf of the USA. My team and I conducted more than 200 interviews in 1989 from people who had lived through the 1960s and had strong feelings about what they had witnessed and lived through, not only during the war, but in the 1950s growing up and in the time since that war has ended.  David Christian was wounded 7 times receiving 7 purple hearts as well as the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism. When he returned from the war, he worked as he does today, to help Vietnam veterans. Bill Ehrhardt, who presents his story in my very popular video clip, \u201cMagnificent Storyteller Soldier\u201d shared his personal experience. Many of my subscribers have reacted to it.  I feel that David Christian is an equally powerful storyteller whose war perceptions and experiences were quite different.  In this video he reflects on his early upbringing in the 1950s, his Catholicism, his powerful relationship with his mother, his experiences with college protesters in the antiwar movement, his return to America and his battles to help his fellow veterans deal with PTSD, job opportunities and other issues that they have confronted.  His story evolves during the interview as he expresses more and more deeply, how he felt and what he saw and how he dealt with it.",

Follow him along his journey as a confused replacement on the way to the front and through his fire experiences under enemy fire. \n\nSpecial thank you for Mr. Loeffler for the introduction to Mr. Schmidt.

This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal.

This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal.

He is the author of nine works of history, including the first two volumes of his planned three-volume history of Russian power and Joseph Stalin, Paradoxes of Power, 1878\u20131928 and Waiting for Hitler, 1929\u20131941. The premise of this show is simple: Peter Robinson poses five questions to Dr. Kotkin: what Xi Jinping, the president of China believes; what Vladimir Putin believes; whether nuclear weapons are a deterrent in the 21st century; the chances of another American renewal; and Kotkin\u2019s rational basis for loving the United States. It\u2019s a fascinating conversation that delves deep into one of the country\u2019s brightest minds. \n\nFor further information: ",

It's bad, very, very bad, and join me as I take you through, analyzing and picking apart each and every little bit of this terrible, terrible title. I review it's cutscenes, story, and particularly gameplay to demonstrate how it fails to do what Half Life 2 did flawlessly, while also failing on it's own merits, it's rife with glitches, bad acting, and it's just shit.\n\nIt also has Keemstar playing the US president, while IHE and Pyrocynical play US marines, it's fucking wild.\n\nPatreon: ",

Isn't life way too complex for that to happen? It seems ridiculous, right? Well, no. Not if you understand biochemistry, which creationists do not. But every once in a while, a hero emerges from academia to champion the cause of the creationist, and lend some illusory credence to their views. In this case, that hero is James Tour, a synthetic organic chemist who insists that abiogenesis is impossible, and he should know better than anyone, because he's a chemist. I was made aware of Dr. Tour after a couple hundred people linked me to a video of his in an empty argument from authority, insisting that because a chemist confirms their religious bias, they must be right. But is Dr. Tour a bit biased himself? Let's find out precisely what his agenda is, shall we?\n\nUpdate: James Tour responded to this single video with a dumpster fire of a 14-part series overflowing with stupidity and lies, which qualifies for the Dunning-Kruger Hall of Fame. Naturally I tore through it like tissue paper, so to watch me do that please check out my two-part response which exposes his fraudulence ten times more thoroughly than this video:\nPart 1: ",

How was the gold in our jewelry, the carbon in our bodies, and the iron in our cars made? In this lecture, we will trace the origin of a gold atom from the Big Bang to the present day, and beyond. You will learn how the elements were forged in the nuclear furnaces inside stars, and how, when they die, these massive stars spread the elements into space. You will learn about the origin of the building blocks of matter in the Big Bang, and we will speculate on the future of the atoms around us today.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Edward Murphy, University of Virginia\nDate: November 13, 2012\n\nYou can download a copy of the Table of Elements from this page: ",

Pierre-Marie Robitaille is a former radiologist who likes to pretend that he understands astrophysics better than astrophysicists. He doesn't. When he talks, he makes ridiculous claims and blatant errors that can be spotted by anyone with a basic understanding of physics and astronomy. Nevertheless, many gullible people speak about him like he's a genius, so I thought I'd explain quite thoroughly how he definitely isn't.

This video was recorded at The Australian National University on 10 April 2012.\n\nRichard Dawkins FRS is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford. Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.\n\nHe is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.\n\nRichard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He has been awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the Nakayama Prize, the Cosmos International Prize, the Kistler Prize, the Shakespeare Prize and the Lewis Thomas Prize.\n\nLawrence M. Krauss is a renowned cosmologist and science populariser, and is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is also the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and nine books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and his most recent bestseller entitled A Universe from Nothing.\n\nHe received his PhD from MIT in 1982 and then joined the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and was a professor at Yale University and Chair of the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University before taking his present position. Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist and Scientific American and appears regularly on radio and television. He is one of the few scientists to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, and is also active in issues of science and society. He serves as co-chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and on the Board of Directors of the Federation of American Scientists.",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
