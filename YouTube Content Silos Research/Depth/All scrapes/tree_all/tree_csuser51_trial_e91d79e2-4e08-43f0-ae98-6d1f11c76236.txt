                        "description": "The Austronesian expansion into Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific was the last and most far-reaching prehistoric human migration. Austronesian languages replaced indigenous languages over nearly half the globe, yet the absolute number of Austronesian colonists was small. Recently, geneticists have identified large geographic disparities in the relative proportions of Asian ancestry across different genetic systems (NRY, mitochondrial DNA, autosomes and X chromosomes) in Austronesian-speaking societies of Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Surprisingly, a substantial genetic discontinuity occurs in the middle of a continuous chain of islands that form the southern arc of the Indonesian archipelago, near the geographic center of the Austronesian world. In the absence of geographic barriers to migration, this genetic boundary and swathe of Austronesian language replacement must have emerged from social behavior. Drawing on decades of comparative ethnological research inspired by F.A.E. van Wouden\u2019s structural model of Austronesian social organization, later codified by Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss as \"House societies\" (\"soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 maison\"), we propose a two-stage ethnographic model in which the appearance of matrilocal \u2018\u2018House societies\u2019\u2019 during the initial phase of the Austronesian expansion, and the subsequent disappearance of \u2018House societies\u2019\u2019 in lowland rice-growing regions, accounts for the observed linguistic, genetic and cultural patterns.\n\nPoint your browser to the following website to see other videos:",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",
