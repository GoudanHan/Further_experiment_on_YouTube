It was the Luftwaffe\u2019s only single seat fighter for the first few years of the Second World War and the RAF\u2019s nemesis during the Battle of Britain. Duxford\u2019s Bf 109 is an E-3/E-4 variant. It was attacked by Spitfires in late 1940 and crash-landed in a field in relatively good condition. Because of this smooth crash landing, the aircraft ended up touring North America before going on display at IWM \u2013 the tourists\u2019 graffiti from these tours can still be seen on its wings. In this video, Curator Adrian Kerrison shows us how much we can learn from looking closely this Battle of Britain icon. Take a look into the cockpit, watch it take off, and hear from those who flew the Bf 109 during World War Two. \n\nBook tickets to Duxford's Battle of Britain Air Show 18 & 19 September: ",

        "description": "The Supermarine Spitfire is one of the most iconic aircraft of all time. Between 1937 and 1947 over 20,000 of them were built and in those 10 years, Spitfires changed dramatically from the Mk 1 to the Mk 24. More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world. In this episode of Duxford in Depth, Graham Rodgers looks at how the Spitfire evolved by taking us through just a few of Duxford's collection of Spitfires including marks 1, 5, 9, 14, and 24.\n\nFrom 27 December until 20 February, see a world-first at IWM Duxford \u2013 the largest collection of Spitfires ever assembled under one roof! Get up close to twelve Spitfires of varying marks side by side on display for a limited time only: ",

Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

    "description": "Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks about Joe Biden being booed at the 9/11 memorial and the hypocrisy of his vaccine mandate. Joe Biden is getting enormous amounts of backlash for his COVID vaccine mandate. While the Biden administration is resorting to force to deal with vaccine hesitancy to fight the Delta variant it was not long ago he was questioning the COVID 19 vaccine. Dave shares video of Kamala Harris, Dr. Fauci, and Joe Biden all being skeptical of the vaccine when it was under the Trump administration. Dave also questions why there is a vaccine mandate exemption for members of congress and their staff.\n\nWatch Dave's FULL DIRECT MESSAGE here:",
