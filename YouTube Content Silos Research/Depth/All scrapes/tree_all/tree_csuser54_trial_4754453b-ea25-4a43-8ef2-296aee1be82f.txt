After being exposed, he turned FBI informant and has since stayed in the United States, becoming a published author of \"Deep Undercover\" and an expert on espionage and Russian intelligence. He was recruited into the KGB after being approached by a member of the East German secret police at the University of Jena in 1969.  \n\nBarsky rates the realism of Russian spying tactics such as message interception, surveillance, and sleeper cells in \"The Fourth Protocol\" (1987), \"Anna\" (2019), \"Bridge of Spies\" (2015), \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" (2011), and the popular TV show \"The Americans\" (2013-2018). \n\nHe also breaks down physical training and spies' backgrounds in \"Red Sparrow\" (2018), \"Salt\" (2010), and Black Widow's first on-screen appearance in \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). He also discusses the Bond movie franchise and its depiction of Russian spies in \"From Russia With Love\" (1963).\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nSAS Soldier Breaks Down 11 Military Scenes",
