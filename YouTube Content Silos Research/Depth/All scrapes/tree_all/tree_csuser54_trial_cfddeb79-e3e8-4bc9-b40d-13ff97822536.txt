For a video game door to feel real, it takes a ton of challenging work. Video game doors have to interact seamlessly with their surroundings, make logical sense, and look good too. They have to strike a delicate balance between real-world accuracy and playability.\n\nAll these factors mean designing a door usually requires work from every department at a game company.\n\nDifferent types of doors require different amounts of work. And these same challenges crop up as you try to add almost any element to a game.\n\nLike any great piece of art, the blood, sweat, and tears that go into doors are often invisible. The best doors are the ones that work seamlessly, and go unnoticed. In this video, we talk to Bryan Singh, a game developer, about why doors are so tricky. \n\nGreat coverage by our colleagues at The Verge: ",

Pieter's operation eventually supplied many big time dealers in the UK. He then began importing cocaine from Ecuador to Europe through a cartel connection.

        "description": "The pharmaceutical industry exerts a huge amount of influence on health policy. Some companies develop highly profitable drugs with public money, while others have been found to have covered up serious side effects.\n\nThe fight against Covid-19 is further fueling the greed of pharmaceutical companies. Does the industry\u2019s influence threaten public health systems? \n\nThe industry has seen major changes in the last decade. Most of the world\u2019s pharmaceuticals are produced by a handful of large corporations, so-called Big Pharma. They\u2019re richer and more powerful than ever. In some cases, they can even call the shots on governmental health policies. \n\nThis documentary is the result of more than a year of research, and brings together patients, whistleblowers, lawyers, doctors and politicians, as well as representatives of the industry. Large laboratories are accused of concealing or downplaying research results to maintain their monopolies. Take the manufacturer Sanofi, whose epilepsy drug Depakine triggered a scandal throughout Europe. In the US, Johnson & Johnson has had to stand trial for driving millions of people into opioid addiction. And Novartis is one of several companies now facing huge fines over improper practices in the treatment of macular degeneration, an eye disease.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry gets support from influential doctors. But only one-fifth of German doctors declare what they receive from drug companies. As the world battles the Coronavirus pandemic, this documentary also looks at the lobbying efforts of manufacturer Gilead, as it seeks approval for a promising drug developed largely with public money. Every company is vying to find the next miracle treatment that will help it succeed against the competition.",
