When it came time to follow up on the success of Max Payne and its sequel, Remedy had an abundance of ideas and a stable of creators eager to implement them. Years into its development cycle however, Sam and his colleagues felt the project had yet to successfully blend its influences and game mechanics into a cohesive experience. Knowing the bones of a remarkable game was present within the work of the previous three years, Remedy set out to rebuild Alan Wake. Here's how they pulled it off, how Alan's story continues in Remedy's critically-acclaimed Control, and where it's set to go with its upcoming DLC.\n\nDirected by Justin Wolfson\nEdited by Shandor Garrison\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",

He turned to bank robbery after threats to his family by a Mexican cartel. He was nicknamed the \"kangaroo bandit,\" having been captured on CCTV stuffing cash into a backpack worn on his chest. He says he robbed over 100 banks across California between 1999 and 2001. He eventually turned himself in and served nine years in prison after pleading guilty to six robberies. He now works as a life coach and motivational speaker, helping newly released prisoners reintegrate into society.

He says that the illegal rave scene in the UK and lack of funding as a university student drove him to sell drugs on a larger scale. Pieter's operation eventually supplied many big time dealers in the UK. He then began importing cocaine from Ecuador to Europe through a cartel connection. Pieter was arrested in Ecuador and sentenced to 12 years in one of the worlds most violent and corrupt prisons. He now works as a public speaker on the dangers of drugs, and also presents a show on local radio station \u201cincapable staircase\u201d every Friday from 4-5:30 pm GMT.",
