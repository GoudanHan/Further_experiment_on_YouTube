You may want to bookmark this page or print it out to have as a handy reference as you will use it often.baby koi care\njapanese koi\nthis video will show you how to Breeding Koi Fish and taking care of Baby Koi . if you have any problem comment i will reply .and your idea suggestions about my channel.. don't forget to subscribe. thanks for watching... \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udc4d\nBreeding Koi and taking care of your Baby Koi can be an exciting process, watching nature at work, but it can be a hard job to do. Especially if you do not have a lot of time to watch your Koi. As you well know (if you already have Koi) they are full of surprises, and the same goes true for breeding Koi. Having given birth to a new generation, they would as willingly eat it as see it grow up. This attitude will continue until the baby Koi are maybe 3 in (8 cm) or larger in total length.\n\nCorrect nutrition makes a major contribution to the vitality and color of a fish, so supplement the normal diet of your Koi (while in the spawning tank) with good quality frozen foods, such as bloodworms and daphnia. Feeding these prepared foods will made up for any live foods that the fish are not eating wile they are in the spawing tank. \n\nDon't Forget to like, comment, share and subscribe to my channel...\n\n ogon filter goi pond showa platinum aquarium\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"The Bala Shark is also known as the Silver Shark  ,Tricolor Shark and Tricolor sharkminnow\" ",
