Jordan Peele's \"Us\" used facial replacement CGI to allow characters to act alongside their doppelg\u00e4ngers. While movies like \"Crawl\" needed CGI to make its alligators as terrifying as possible, many horror movies still rely on practical effects to scare audiences. The 2019 \"Child\u2019s Play\" reboot built an animatronic Chucky controlled by puppeteers, while \"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\" went all out creating makeup effects and costumes to turn its cast members into monsters.\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER:\nWhat 8 Disney Live-Action Remakes Looked Like Behind The Scenes | Movies Insider",

The genre is unique in the sheer size of the spectacles that must be created, with special effects teams building entire cities or worlds only to level them. In this episode of \"Movies Insider,\" we break down the diverse techniques used to create extreme weather phenomena on the big screen, from miniature effects to shaky deck sets to a massive light and rain rig, and show you exactly what these effects looked like behind the scenes.\n\nWe do a deep dive into how \"San Andreas\" used CG to sculpt a deep fissure in the earth, providing the backdrop for The Rock's heroics, and how \"The Impossible\" recreated the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami with real water, filming Naomi Watts' and Tom Holland's scenes in Europe's largest water tank. \n\nPlus, see how \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" created a hellish sandstorm fit for George Miller's dystopian vision, how Darren Aronofsky brought the biblical story of Noah's Ark and the Great Flood to life with large-scale rain effects in \"Noah,\" and how Paul W. S. Anderson's \"Pompeii\" made an exacting recreation of the ancient city only to later destroy it with a volcanic eruption, earthquake, and tsunami. And find out how \"Into the Storm\" made a fantastical fire tornado look believable and how apocalypse movies like \"2012\" and \"The Day After Tomorrow\" used groundbreaking special effects to imagine end-of-the-world scenarios. \n\n\"2012\" is now available from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment\nTo purchase \"2012\": ",

                "description": "Using completely real crowds in Hollywood productions can be a huge logistical challenge. That's why movies and TV shows have found many ways to make crowds look bigger than they are. Older movies like \"Ben-Hur\" used matte paintings, while movies like \"Glory Road'' have used inflatable extras. Today, duplication and CGI are the most frequently used techniques. On the Apple TV  series \"Ted Lasso,\" Barnstorm VFX had the daunting challenge of filling a 26,000-seat stadium using a mix of real and fake people. As Barnstorm VFX supervisor Lawson Deming told us, it's the mix of the two that best convinces the viewer.\n\nThanks to Barnstorm VFX for speaking with us and providing footage from \"Ted Lasso\" and \"Insecure.\" Check out more of its work here:\nwww.barnstormvfx.com",

This can be a big problem on set, as any of these unwanted sounds can get in the way of dialogue. To ensure the sound team gets the best sound possible, the prop team will create silent versions of real products. Prop master Scott Reeder replaced loud pool balls with much quieter painted racquetballs for bar scenes in shows like \"Friday Night Lights.\" Meanwhile, Tim Schultz of Prop TRX uses vinyl and fabric to make quieter versions of grocery bags, sandwich bags, and cellophane, as seen on \"Entourage,\" \"Mike & Molly,\" and \"The Kominsky Method.\" Reeder and Schultz showed us how they found quiet alternatives to some of the loudest props out there.\n\nFind more of Tim Schultz\u2019s silent products here:",
