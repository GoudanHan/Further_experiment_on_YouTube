Writer and star Angus Macfadyen first portrayed the outlaw Scottish king 25 years ago in Mel Gibson\u2019s Academy Award-winning epic \u201cBraveheart,\u201d a film Director and Producer Richard Gray was determined to do justice to. Despite having a budget more suited to an independent film than a Hollywood period piece and shooting in sub-zero temperatures with chest-high snow, the cast and crew of \u201cRobert The Bruce\u201d overcame each challenge and delivered a film that feels intimate from moment to moment, but epic in scope. Learn how they pulled it off on this episode of War Stories.\n\nRobert The Bruce is available on Digital Platforms and VOD.\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",

When it came time to follow up on the success of Max Payne and its sequel, Remedy had an abundance of ideas and a stable of creators eager to implement them. Years into its development cycle however, Sam and his colleagues felt the project had yet to successfully blend its influences and game mechanics into a cohesive experience. Knowing the bones of a remarkable game was present within the work of the previous three years, Remedy set out to rebuild Alan Wake. Here's how they pulled it off, how Alan's story continues in Remedy's critically-acclaimed Control, and where it's set to go with its upcoming DLC.\n\nDirected by Justin Wolfson\nEdited by Shandor Garrison\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: ",

The US mafia is featured in many classic movies from the 1920s onwards. We discuss the cultural significance and accuracy of famous crime scenes in movies and TV shows, such as \"The Godfather\" and \"The Sopranos.\" Franzese also points out inaccuracies in scenes from mob comedies such as \"Analyze This\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nFranzese discusses true stories and real-life characters featured in \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino.\" He talks about his proximity to the events of Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman,\" the Oscar-nominated movie starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. \n\nAfter Franzese was released from prison in 1995, he became the only high ranking official of a major mafia family to ever walk away, without protective custody, and survive. Franzese is the author of \"Blood Covenant\" and \"I\u2019ll Make You An Offer You Can\u2019t Refuse.\" He now works as a public speaker and motivator.\n\nMORE 'HOW REAL IS IT?':\n\nExplosives Expert Rates Movie Explosions: ",

He turned to bank robbery after threats to his family by a dangerous gang. He was nicknamed the \"kangaroo bandit,\" having been captured on CCTV stuffing cash into a backpack worn on his chest. He says he robbed over 100 banks across California between 1999 and 2001. He eventually turned himself in and served nine years in prison after pleading guilty to six robberies. He now works as a life coach and motivational speaker, helping newly released prisoners reintegrate into society. He's also a partner in two production companies. \n\nMORE INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Drug Gangs Actually Work | How Crime Works",

He says that the illegal rave scene in the UK and lack of funding as a university student drove him to sell drugs on a larger scale. Pieter's operation eventually supplied many big time dealers in the UK. He then began importing cocaine from Ecuador to Europe through a cartel connection. Pieter was arrested in Ecuador and sentenced to 12 years in one of the worlds most violent and corrupt prisons.
