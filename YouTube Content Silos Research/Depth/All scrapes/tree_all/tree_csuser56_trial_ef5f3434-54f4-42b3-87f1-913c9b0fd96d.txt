If you watched my Dark Souls Series, please let me know which method of presentation that you liked more. There were a few more jokes in this video and my intention was that they wouldn't interrupt the flow of what I was saying and feel natural.\n\nI also uploaded it all as one video instead of broken into parts like Dark Souls. Let me know if you liked this better, or would have preferred parts that you can use as breaks to come back later.\n\nAs I watched this back after uploading it, I noticed that I sound highly critical of Blizzard. They're still one of my favorite developers even after the statements I made at the end of this video. Hopefully I'm wrong with my guesses, or that even if I'm right that the changes will be positive.\n\nThanks for watching! If you like the stuff I do, you might want to subscribe to the channel. If you like me even MORE than that and want to support me (I like you too), the best way would be to check out my books found here:\n\nTwitter: ",

A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",
