N3200 is a Mk 1, an early example of the RAF\u2019s monoplane 8-gun singer-seat single-engined fighter. In this video, our expert Liam Shaw takes us into the cockpit and shows us around. We see how a pilot would take off, including using the rare hand-pumped undercarriage, and learn what it would be like to fly in the Spitfire, as well as hearing from some pilots who flew in the Battle of Britain. \n\nBook tickets to the Spitfire Evolution exhibition opening at IWM Duxford on 27 December: ",

        "description": "The Supermarine Spitfire is one of the most iconic aircraft of all time. Between 1937 and 1947 over 20,000 of them were built and in those 10 years, Spitfires changed dramatically from the Mk 1 to the Mk 24. More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world. In this episode of Duxford in Depth, Graham Rodgers looks at how the Spitfire evolved by taking us through just a few of Duxford's collection of Spitfires including marks 1, 5, 9, 14, and 24.\n\nFrom 27 December until 20 February, see a world-first at IWM Duxford \u2013 the largest collection of Spitfires ever assembled under one roof! Get up close to twelve Spitfires of varying marks side by side on display for a limited time only: ",

Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
