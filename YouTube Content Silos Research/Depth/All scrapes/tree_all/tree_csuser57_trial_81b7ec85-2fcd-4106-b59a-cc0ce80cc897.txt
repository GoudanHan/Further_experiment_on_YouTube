Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

We just have to look at things in the sky with our eyeballs. In fact, that's how we figured out the earth is a sphere thousands of years ago, before science even existed. Last time we looked at the moon, so today let's look at the stars. How do they move through the sky, and can we make sense of it on a flat earth? Spoiler: no, we definitely can't. But be a lamb and watch anyway, would you?\n\nPart 1 in this series: ",

My 10 challenges were apparently so impossible that no one attempted a single one of them, despite the numerous pathetic attempts at response videos. It has become clear that even though I've been explaining middle school level science in these videos, it's still way too far above their heads, so with this one I really wanted to break it down even further for them. Here's a tidy little morsel of flat earth destruction that requires precisely zero scientific knowledge to comprehend. Enjoy.\n\n10 Challenges for Flat Earthers: ",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

Octave Durham is no longer involved in criminal activity. Since he has reformed and spent time in prison, he works with detective Arthur Brand to solve international art and jewellery heists. \n\nThey look at \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" (1999), \"The Monuments Men\" (2014), \"The Art of the Steal\" (2013), \"Topkapi\" (1964), \"Ocean's Twelve\" (2004), \"Dr. No\" (1962), \"Black Panther\" (2018), \"Hudson Hawk\" (1991), and \"The Blacklist\" S2E14 (2015). \n\nCould anyone walk out of a gallery with a piece of art? How are gallery security guards trained? Is gallery CCTV actually monitored? Do thieves ever abseil in from the ceiling? And does Interpol actively chase down stolen paintings?\n\nFind out more about Arthur Brand: ",

[It] demonstrates, as powerfully as any book on criminal justice that I\u2019ve ever read, the extent to which brutality, unfairness, and racial bias continue to infect criminal law in the United States. But at the same time that [Bryan] Stevenson tells an utterly damning story of deep-seated and widespread injustice, he also recounts instances of human compassion, understanding, mercy, and justice that offer hope. . . . Just Mercy is a remarkable amalgam, at once a searing indictment of American criminal justice and a stirring testament to the salvation that fighting for the vulnerable sometimes yields.\u201d\n\u2014David Cole, The New York Review of Books\n\n\u201cA searing, moving and infuriating memoir . . . Bryan Stevenson may, indeed, be America\u2019s Mandela. For decades he has fought judges, prosecutors and police on behalf of those who are impoverished, black or both. . . . Injustice is easy not to notice when it affects people different from ourselves; that helps explain the obliviousness of our own generation to inequity today. We need to wake up. And that is why we need a Mandela in this country.\u201d\n\u2014Nicholas Kristof, The New York Times\n\nThis event was held on April 1, 2015.",
