Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and are afraid to speak honestly. Rates of anxiety, depression and suicide are rising. How did this happen?\n\nEminent social psychologist Jonathan Haidt thinks the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education\u2014ideas that are making it harder and harder for students to become autonomous adults who are able to navigate the bumpy road of life.\n\nIn this riveting lecture drawing from his New York Times bestselling book, Haidt will investigate the many social trends that have intersected to promote the spread of these untruths.",

                        "description": "On October 6, 2016, Professor Jonathan Haidt gave a Hayek Lecture at Duke. The event was co-sponsored by the programs in the History of Political Economy (HOPE), Philosophy, Politics, & Economics (PPE), and American Values and Institutions (AVI). The event was open to the public, but also served as a guest lecture in Professor Jonathan Anomaly\u2019s PPE course. \nProfessor Haidt argues that conflicts arise at many American universities today because they are pursuing two potentially incompatible goals: truth and social justice. While Haidt thinks both goals are important, he maintains that they can come into conflict. \nAccording to some versions of social justice, whenever we observe a disparity of outcomes between races, genders, or other groups, we should infer that injustice has been done. Haidt challenges this view of social justice and shows how it sometimes leads to violations of truth, and even justice. \nHaidt concludes that universities should be free to pursue whatever goals \u2013 truth or social justice \u2013 they want, but that they should make it clear which of these two goals is their \u201ctelos\u201d \u2013 their highest purpose. He ends with a discussion of his initiative, HeterodoxAcademy.org, to bring more viewpoint diversity to universities in order to improve research and learning.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel for more!\nFollow us at ",

                    "description": "Many would argue that these are the fundamental goals of a good education. So why has Cambridge University taken to warning its students that the sexual violence in Titus Andronicus might be traumatic for them? Why are other universities in America and increasingly in Britain introducing measures to protect students from speech and texts they might find harmful? Safe spaces, trigger warnings and no-platforming are now campus buzzwords \u2013 and they\u2019re all designed to limit free speech and the exchange of ideas. As celebrated social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues in his book 'The Coddling of the American Mind', university students are increasingly retreating from ideas they fear may damage their mental health, and presenting themselves as fragile and in need of protection from any viewpoint that might make them feel unsafe.The culture of safety, as Haidt calls it, may be well intentioned, but it is hampering the development of young people and leaving them unprepared for adult life, with devastating consequences for them, for the companies that will soon hire them, and for society at large.\n\nThat, Haidt\u2019s critics argue, is an infuriating misinterpretation of initiatives designed to help students. Far from wanting to shut down free speech and debate, what really concerns the advocates of these new measures is the equal right to speech in a public forum where the voices of the historically marginalised are given the same weight as those of more privileged groups. Warnings to students that what they\u2019re about to read or hear might be disturbing are not an attempt to censor classic literature, but a call for consideration and sensitivity. Safe spaces aren\u2019t cotton-wool wrapped echo chambers, but places where minority groups and people who have suffered trauma can share their experiences without fear of hostility.\n\nIn November 2018, Haidt came to the Intelligence Squared stage to discuss and debate these ideas. Joining him were the former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who believes that educating young people through debate and argument helps foster robustness, author and activist Eleanor Penny, and sociologist Kehinde Andrews, one of the UK\u2019s leading thinkers on race and the history of racism.",

This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal. The last three were all awarded by the now-extinct government of the Republic of Vietnam.  He received the PUC and the two Vietnamese unit citations as a member of 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment.

Shouldn't we be able to do experiments to test its validity? We sure can.

            "description": "Anti-science mentality is rampant in this day and age, and one of the more peculiar aspects of this trend is the current fad that is the Flat Earth model. There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?\n\nWatch the whole Astronomy/Astrophysics playlist: ",

        "description": "Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
