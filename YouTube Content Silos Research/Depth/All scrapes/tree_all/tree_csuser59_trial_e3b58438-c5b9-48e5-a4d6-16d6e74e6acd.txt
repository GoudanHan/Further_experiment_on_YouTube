[It] demonstrates, as powerfully as any book on criminal justice that I\u2019ve ever read, the extent to which brutality, unfairness, and racial bias continue to infect criminal law in the United States. But at the same time that [Bryan] Stevenson tells an utterly damning story of deep-seated and widespread injustice, he also recounts instances of human compassion, understanding, mercy, and justice that offer hope. . . . Just Mercy is a remarkable amalgam, at once a searing indictment of American criminal justice and a stirring testament to the salvation that fighting for the vulnerable sometimes yields.\u201d\n\u2014David Cole, The New York Review of Books\n\n\u201cA searing, moving and infuriating memoir . . . Bryan Stevenson may, indeed, be America\u2019s Mandela. For decades he has fought judges, prosecutors and police on behalf of those who are impoverished, black or both. . . . Injustice is easy not to notice when it affects people different from ourselves; that helps explain the obliviousness of our own generation to inequity today. We need to wake up. And that is why we need a Mandela in this country.\u201d\n\u2014Nicholas Kristof, The New York Times\n\nThis event was held on April 1, 2015.",

IF the crew and the Coast Guard had taken proper measures.\nYoo Li-an reports. \nA ferry with about 300 passengers,... most of them students, is sinking fast. \nBut instead of staging full-out rescue efforts,... the crew members are nowhere to be seen, and the coast guard is watching from afar. \nThis... was the testimony given by six survivors of April's Sewol-ho ferry disaster... who are students of Danwon High School.\nSpeaking in a court hearing Monday afternoon,... the six gave a chronological account of the events from the time of the accident.\nOne said that about \"30 students were lined up for the emergency exit. But when the rescue team didn't arrive,... each student began jumping into the water.\"\nAs soon as she did,... the student says in a shaky voice that the waves suddenly crashed up against the emergency exit,... where 10 of her friends had been waiting. They were unable to escape. \n\nAnother surviving student... also said that the Sewol-ho crew were nowhere to be seen for the entirety of her escape.\nShe testified that the coast guard was within an arm's reach of the emergency exit,.. but only lifted out the people who fell into the water.\nShe said she told them a lot more of her friends were just inside the emergency exit,... but the coast guard only watched as the ship continued to list. \nMost students told judges that there were repeated announcements instructing passengers to stay where they were.\n\nIf they had received instructions to escape, the six students said many more could have survived.\nThe students ended their testimonies by asking the panel of judges to punish the crewmen to the strictest letter of the law.\n\nSewol-ho ferry captain Lee Joon-seok and three of his fellow crew are currently on trial for charges of homicide by willful negligence.\nNone were present at Monday's court hearing.\nYoo Li-an, Arirang News.",

In the last desperate moments before the ship was going down...\na daughter texts her mother.\n\n\"Mom, the ship is sinking.\"\n\nIn shock and confused,... the mother calls her daughter, [ ] Jeon Su-young right away.\n\n\n\" ' , ' . .\"\n[ : I told her, 'hurry wear a life vest.' But all she said was 'Mom, the students are all wearing life vests.' Now that I think about it, this meant that students had life vests on, while she didn't.]\n\nTo her boyfriend, Su-young texts him that, \"there are no life vests... I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe boyfriend calls her immediately, but they hang up after 12 seconds on the line.\nSu-young tells him that she needs to call her students' parents.\n\n\n\" .\"\n[ : She said the ship was sinking and that she had to quickly get all her students in life vests. We hung up shortly after. She said her battery was running low, and that she needed to call her students' parents.]\n\nHer last words to her boyfriend... \"I love you\" and \"Thank you.\"\n\nIt was Su-young's second year as a homeroom teacher at Danwon High School.\nAnd as for the school's yearly field trip--- this one to Jeju island on the [ ] Sewol-ho ferry, was her first.\n\nHer room remains untouched... since the day she left for the ill-fated trip. \nHer bike too... remains parked... waiting for Su-young to return.\nApparently her grandmother is also waiting... for her granddaughter to come home safely.\n\n\n\" . . .\"\n[ : Her grandmother still believes that she is alive. She says that her granddaughter is safely inside the ship. She continues to believe that.]\n\nBut as much as there is sadness over the loss... her mother is also proud of her daughter... who put the lives of her students before her own. \nConnie Lee, Arirang News.",
