Poverty in America, he says, compared to the rest of the world, is not severe.  Many poor people in poverty in the United States have one or two cars, central heating, and cell phones. The real problem for the poor is the destruction of the family, which Sowell argues dramatically increased once welfare policies were introduced in the 1960s.",

After being exposed, he turned FBI informant and has since stayed in the United States, becoming a published author of \"Deep Undercover\" and an expert on espionage and Russian intelligence. He was recruited into the KGB after being approached by a member of the East German secret police at the University of Jena in 1969.  \n\nBarsky rates the realism of Russian spying tactics such as message interception, surveillance, and sleeper cells in \"The Fourth Protocol\" (1987), \"Anna\" (2019), \"Bridge of Spies\" (2015), \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" (2011), and the popular TV show \"The Americans\" (2013-2018). \n\nHe also breaks down physical training and spies' backgrounds in \"Red Sparrow\" (2018), \"Salt\" (2010), and Black Widow's first on-screen appearance in \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). He also discusses the Bond movie franchise and its depiction of Russian spies in \"From Russia With Love\" (1963).\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nSAS Soldier Breaks Down 11 Military Scenes",

Filmed in 1929, at the time of the Civil War the two men would have been 16 years old and 26 years old when the war started in 1861.  \n\nThe General Price they mentioned is none other than General Sterling Price:\n\nOn August 10, 1861, at the Battle of Wilson's Creek outside Springfield, Price\u2019s and McCulloch\u2019s combined force defeated Lyon, forcing the federals\u2019 withdrawal. At Wilson\u2019s Creek, Lyon earned the unenviable distinction of being the first Union general killed in the war. In September, Price marched northward, driving from the border counties Kansas Jayhawkers under the command of James H. Lane. Price then marched to Lexington, where his army besieged and forced the surrender of a 3,500-man fortified garrison of federal troops and Home Guard under James A. Mulligan.\n\nPressed by troops under John C. Fr\u00e9mont, commander of the Department of the West, Price soon retreated into the southern counties, where he attended the \u201crump session\u201d of the legislature and voted for secession in Neosho. After a brief occupation of central Missouri, Price and his state troops went into winter camp near Springfield, where they transferred into Confederate service and in February withdrew to Arkansas.\n\nThis video is made for educational purposes for fair use under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976.",

This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal. The last three were all awarded by the now-extinct government of the Republic of Vietnam.  He received the PUC and the two Vietnamese unit citations as a member of 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. You can find more at his website -www.wdehrhart.com. ",
