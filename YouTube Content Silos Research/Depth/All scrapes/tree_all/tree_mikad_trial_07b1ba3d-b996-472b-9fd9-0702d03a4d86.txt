                    "description": "Former US submarine commander L. David Marquet rated the realism of submarine scenes in popular movies, judging their technological accuracy as well as the depiction of life on board.\n\nMarquet addresses the realism of nuclear crisis movies, such as \"The World Is Not Enough\" and \"K-19: The Widowmaker,\". He also rated the accuracy of standoff scenes in \"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"The Enemy Below\", \"Hunter Killer,\" and \"Crimson Tide.\" He also breaks down the realism of costumes, tactics, and terminology from \"U-571.\"\n\nIs life on board a submarine, including confined conditions and drills, as depicted in \"Das Boot\"? Would Navy SEALs enter a submarine from a HALO drop similar to \"Act of Valor\", and is it possible for a submarine to hear music from the water's surface, like in  \"The Wolf's Call\"? Can holes on a submarine be plugged with pins and other metal objects, as we see in \"The Simpsons\"? Would nuclear missiles be triggered by dislodging in a ship interior, such as in \"Aquaman\"?\n\nMarquet graduated top of his class from the US Naval Academy and served for 28 years on submarines, including as an engineer officer aboard the USS Will Rogers, then as captain on the USS Olympia and the USS Santa Fe. Having retired in 2009, he is now a Wall Street Journal best-selling author of \"Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders.\"\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

The US mafia is featured in many classic movies from the 1920s onwards. We discuss the cultural significance and accuracy of famous crime scenes in movies and TV shows, such as \"The Godfather\" and \"The Sopranos.\" Franzese also points out inaccuracies in scenes from mob comedies such as \"Analyze This\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nFranzese discusses true stories and real-life characters featured in \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino.\" He talks about his proximity to the events of Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman,\" the Oscar-nominated movie starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. \n\nAfter Franzese was released from prison in 1995, he became the only high ranking official of a major mafia family to ever walk away, without protective custody, and survive. Franzese is the author of \"Blood Covenant\" and \"I\u2019ll Make You An Offer You Can\u2019t Refuse.\" He now works as a public speaker and motivator.\n\nMORE 'HOW REAL IS IT?':\n\nExplosives Expert Rates Movie Explosions: ",

Known as \"The Reaper,\" Irving says he killed 33 enemies as a sniper for the US 3rd Ranger Battalion. He is the co-author of \"Reaper: Drone Strike: A Sniper Novel.\"\n\nIrving rates the realism of classic war movies such as \"Clear and Present Danger\" (1994), \"Enemy at the Gates\" (2001), and \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998). He breaks down long-range-sniping scenes featuring Will Smith in \"Gemini Man\" (2019) and Mark Wahlberg in \"Shooter\" (2007). \nHe also looks at modern-day war movies set in Iraq and Afghanistan, such as \"American Sniper\" (2014), \"Jarhead\" (2005), \"Lone Survivor\" (2013), and \"The Hurt Locker\" (2009). Irving rates the realism of the weapons used, along with body position, stealth, and environment. \n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nForensic Pathologist Rates 11 Autopsy Scenes In Movies | How Real Is It?",
