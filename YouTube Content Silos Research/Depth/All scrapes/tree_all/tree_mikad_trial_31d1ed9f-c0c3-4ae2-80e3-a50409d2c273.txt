Smollett faces six felony charges. He could spend three years in prison if he\u2019s convicted on all of them. Smollett\u2019s lawyers argue hilariously that he is the \u201creal victim,\u201d but no sober person on the planet believes that. Jussie Smollett faked a hate crime. The question is how did anyone, anywhere, ever fall for this story, even for a moment? \n...\nSubscribe to Fox News! ",

It\u2019s inconceivable that you could compare a riot at the Capitol to the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor or to the terrorists that killed almost 3,000 Americans on 9/11 and yet Harris cheerfully lusted the three together as if they were the same event. And I think it just tells you how totally unfit she is to be vice president. She is vice president, they won the seat, I hope the American people learned a lesson about picking people who don\u2019t know anything. \n\n ",

            "description": "In the late 1960's Charles Manson led a small, fanatical cult on a self-styled war against society. He and several female followers were convicted of at least seven murders, including actress Sharon Tate - then eight months pregnant. The world was shocked not just by the cruelty of the crimes but the robot-like behaviour of Manson's 'family' during their trial. For many, the only comfort was the thought that Manson would be put away for life. That's why this 1981 interview caused such a stir. Not only do we see Manson, cold and unrepentant - but we hear his thoughts on gaining parole and getting out of prison 'to play like a human'.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ",

This is a clip of poet and educator Bill Ehrhart from one of those interviews - a very articulate Vietnam veteran who joined the military with patriotism in his heart. He has written a book on his experiences - Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, Search the word \"Vietnam\" on my YouTube channel to find more related clips. Including one more by this man. Here is his background of service - W. D. Ehrhart served with 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, from early February 1967 to late February 1968. His service number is 2279361. He holds the Purple Heart Medal, Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation (2), Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, Cross of Gallantry Meritorious Unit Citation, Civic Action Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnamese Campaign Medal. The last three were all awarded by the now-extinct government of the Republic of Vietnam.  He received the PUC and the two Vietnamese unit citations as a member of 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. You can find more at his website -www.wdehrhart.com. ",
