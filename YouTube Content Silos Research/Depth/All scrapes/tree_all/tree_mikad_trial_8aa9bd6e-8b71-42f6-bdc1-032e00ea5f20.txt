                "description": "China has come a long way since the establishment of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. From a poor agrarian society, it has now emerged as an industrial powerhouse, contributing nearly 30 percent of the world's economic growth. It has even overtaken Japan as the world\u2019s second largest economy and lifted 800 million people out of poverty within just a single generation. \n\nBut 70 years on, the Communist Party of China under the leadership of its strongman President Xi Jinping is facing the greatest test of its leadership. The continuing social unrest in Hong Kong, a slowing economy and the escalating trade war with the United States are threatening its undermine his China dream. Can the tremendous progress that China has achieved so far simply falter from now on? Or will China continue to prevail as a force to be reckoned with in spite of all these challenges 70 years after its birth?\n\n==========================\nABOUT THE SHOW: Insight investigates and analyses topical issues that impact Asia and the rest of the world.

Given the serial number NX611, she was one of the first 150 B Mk VII Avro Lancasters destined as part of the RAF's Tiger Force in the Far East. However, Japan's early surrender meant these aircraft were suddenly surplus to requirements and, instead of seeing service, NX611 ended up in storage at Llandow. There she stayed until 1952. From then on, a chequered career followed.\nIn April 1952 she was bought by the French Government. Painted midnight blue, she flew maritime patrol for the French NAvro Lancaster NX611 in at RAAF Butterworthaval Air Arm. Ten years later, she went to Noumeau, New Caledonia, was painted white and used for air sea rescue and cartography. Then in 1964, the French presented her to the Historical Aircraft Preservation Society and flew her to her new home in Sydney where she was overhauled before being flown back to Britain. It took nine days to complete the 12,000 mile journey back to her homeland- seventy flying hours- landing at Biggin Hill on 13 May, 1965.\n\nTemporarily grounded, due to expiry of permitted flying hours, it was 1967 before NX611 flew again, but even then public appearances were brief because of prohibitive costs.\nShe was flown to Lavenham in Suffolk and, a few years later, in 1972, was put up for auction at 'Squires Gate', Blackpool.\n\nMeanwhile, in Lincolnshire, determined to commemorate the death of their brother Chistopher who was killed on the Nuremburg Raid in March 1944, and all of the men who served in Bomber Command, Fred and Harold Panton had decided to purchase a Second World War Bomber. At one time, they had had their eyes on a Halifax which was coming up for sale, but their father told them, in no uncertain terms, they would not be permitted to keep one at his farm.\n\nThe years passed, but the brothers still held on to their dream. Eventually, Fred and Harold became co-owners of their own farm. When some land came up for sale which included part of the defunct East Kirkby airfield they bought it. Some areas of concrete and a few buildings still stood on the old airfield, in a state of disrepair.  They used part of the area to set up a chicken farm. However, with the idea of owning an exhibition aircraft still foremost in their in their minds, they also began to renovate the \"working area\" of the airfield. That included building a new hangar, where an original T2 hangar had stood there during the war years.\n\nLearning about the forthcoming auction, via an advertisement, Fred and Harold decided to try and purchase the old Lancaster. This aircraft could be the perfect monument to their brother's memory. When Fred saw NX611 for the very first time at Blackpool, she stood lonely and forlorn, waiting to be auctioned off to the highest bidder. Around her, a great Avro Lancaster NX611 at RAF Scamptoncrowd stood- some hopefully putting in bids, but most \n\njust watched- curious to see one of the country's finest types of Bomber at close range.  Sadly, due to the reserve not being reached, she was withdrawn from the auction and later privately sold to the Rt Hon Lord Lilford.  Fred and Harold kept in contact with her new owner and eventually, whilst she stood Gate Guardian at RAF Scampton, near Lincoln, and after one or two hiccups in the furtherance of their ambition to own her, a deal was struck with Lord Lilford's agent.",

The campaign bombed twenty-six major Combined Bomber Offensive targets. The targets included the Krupp armament works (Essen), the Nordstern synthetic-oil plant (Gelsenkirchen), and the Rheinmetal-Borsig plant in D\u00fcsseldorf. The latter was safely evacuated during the Battle of the Ruhr. Although not strictly part of the Ruhr area, the battle of the Ruhr included other cities such as Cologne which were within the Rhine-Ruhr region and considered part of the same \"industrial complex\". Some targets were not sites of heavy industrial production but part of the production and movement of materiel.\n\nAlthough the Ruhr had always been a target for the RAF from the start of the war, the organized defences and the large amount of industrial pollutants produced that gave a semi-permanent smog or industrial haze hampered accurate bombing. Before the Battle of the Ruhr ended, Operation Gomorrah began the \"Battle of Hamburg\". Even after this switch of focus to Hamburg, there would be further raids on the Ruhr area by the RAF in part to keep German defences dispersed, just as there had been raids on areas other than the Ruhr during the battle.",

                "description": "The Avro Lancaster Bomber is one of the most famous heavy bombers of the Second World War. With a wingspan of 102 feet and four Rolls-Royce Merlin V-12 engines, the Lancaster could carry the heaviest bomb load in the European Theatre of Operations. This carrying capacity facilitated one of the most high-profile missions of the war: the attack on the Ruhr valley in 1943, now known as the Dam Busters Raid, when 19 Lancasters were adapted to carry Upkeep, the famous Bouncing Bomb. \n\nIn this video, our expert tells us why the Lancaster Bomber played such a crucial role in WW2. We go inside the fuselage of Duxford\u2019s Lancaster KB889, take a look at the cockpit, and explore the enormous bomb load of this Second World War icon.\n\nInterested in a closer look?

            "description": "When Sir Geoffrey de Havilland first pitched his idea for a two-seater bomber made of wood with no armament, few people were willing to accept his design. But the de Havilland Mosquito went on to become one of the most successful and popular aircraft of the Second World War. The defence of this bomber would be its speed. Mosquitos were among the first multi-role combat aircraft: they could be turned to anything and excelled at everything they did. They were popular with pilots and were adapted into numerous different roles to great success. In this video, our Duxford expert Graham Rodgers tells us how this little wooden bomber came into action, and we hear from some of those who experienced its power first-hand. \n\nGet tickets to Duxford\u2019s Air Show on 18 and 19 September 2021: ",

        "description": "The Supermarine Spitfire is one of the most iconic aircraft of all time. Between 1937 and 1947 over 20,000 of them were built and in those 10 years, Spitfires changed dramatically from the Mk 1 to the Mk 24. More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world. In this episode of Duxford in Depth, Graham Rodgers looks at how the Spitfire evolved by taking us through just a few of Duxford's collection of Spitfires including marks 1, 5, 9, 14, and 24.\n\nFrom 27 December until 20 February, see a world-first at IWM Duxford \u2013 the largest collection of Spitfires ever assembled under one roof!
