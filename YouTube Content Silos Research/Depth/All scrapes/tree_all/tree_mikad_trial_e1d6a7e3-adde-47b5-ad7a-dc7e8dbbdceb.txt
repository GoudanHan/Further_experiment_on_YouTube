First of all, you have omicron. Second of all, now you have the weather on top of it. Third of all, you had the price of crude oil -- it's 83, 84, 85, 86 dollars going to. And if Russia shakes a little bit around and makes believe they're going to attack Ukraine, you can have $100 oil and Mr. Putin will be laughing all the way to the bank. So what's happening in our country is omicron is keeping a lot of people home in the Midwest and a lot of places, taxing the ability of warehouses to stock the product, load the product, and put it on the trucks that deliver to the stores. Now, what's going on? There's a shortage of truck drivers, so it creates an entire system of problems.\"\n\n...\n\nSubscribe to Fox Business! ",
