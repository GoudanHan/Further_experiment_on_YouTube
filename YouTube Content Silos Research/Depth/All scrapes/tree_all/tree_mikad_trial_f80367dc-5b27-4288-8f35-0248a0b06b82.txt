Do you need to change oil sooner than a year if your car has not yet reached the recommended miles for an oil change?  Two engines with oil over one year in the crankcase tested to determine if the oil was still good or if it had become corrosive.  Oil tested by Project Farm and by an independent oil testing lab for moisture content, total base number, contamination, acidity, and overall condition.  The oil in both engines had not yet reached the oil change interval for miles/hours.  Recommend following the manufacturers oil change interval guidelines for miles and length of time for your car.\n\n\u27a1 Thank you very much for supporting the channel: ",

The premise of the show is to attempt to fool Penn and Teller. Penn and Teller have their own show called Penn & Teller Fool Us in Las Vegas where magicians go on the show to try and fool Penn and Teller. Illusionists Penn & Teller sit in the audience and watch as magicians try to impress them with a trick that the famous illusionists are unable to duplicate. If a magician successfully hoodwinks the legendary duo with a trick, be it a sleight-of-hand routine or a grand illusion, that person wins a trip to Las Vegas to perform as an opening act in Penn & Teller's show at the Rio Hotel & Casino.\n\nThis video was originally on my channel with millions of views but due to a misunderstanding over my rights, YouTube removed it.  They discovered the errors of their ways and said I could repost but by then others had done so and I felt no need to repost. \n\nI'm posting now to ensure there is a video record on my channel.\nI hope you enjoy my first appearance.\n\n-shawn",

    "description": "Everyone PLEASE take 5 minutes to watch this video\u2014and more importantly, SHARE IT.  I have been warning everyone since last year about what these \"fact-checkers\" represent, and we are inching ever-closer to a totalitarian state. I began suing the fact-checkers last year because I knew that their actions would culminate into this extraordinary moment in American history: a sitting President of the United States has been censored. This means none of us are safe from being wiped away. My Facebook page has long since been demonetized but I believe we can make this video viral by sharing person to person. I still believe in the power of the people.",
