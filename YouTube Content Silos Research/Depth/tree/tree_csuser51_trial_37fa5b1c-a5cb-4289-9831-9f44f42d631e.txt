We just have to look at things in the sky with our eyeballs. In fact, that's how we figured out the earth is a sphere thousands of years ago, before science even existed. Last time we looked at the moon, so today let's look at the stars. How do they move through the sky, and can we make sense of it on a flat earth? Spoiler: no, we definitely can't.

It has become clear that even though I've been explaining middle school level science in these videos, it's still way too far above their heads, so with this one I really wanted to break it down even further for them. Here's a tidy little morsel of flat earth destruction that requires precisely zero scientific knowledge to comprehend. Enjoy.\n\n10 Challenges for Flat Earthers: ",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

This difficult challenge of completing six Mario games back to back in under an hour has long been part of speedrunning community lore, but where did it come from? Who has completed it? And where does the record stand today? \n\nAfter 9 months, I am so happy to finally share this video with you guys! Huge thanks to you for watching this video and my community for supporting me along the way. You guys are amazing and I just want to say thank you! :D\n\nWatch the Marihour grind live! ",
