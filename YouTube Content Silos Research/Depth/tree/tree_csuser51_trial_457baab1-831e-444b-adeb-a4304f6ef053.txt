Here, he reacts to seven memorable scenes featuring medieval weapons and armor and rates them based on their historical accuracy. \n\nCapwell looks at armor and weapons within fantasy franchises, such as Eomer's helmet in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" (2002).  Using artifacts from The Wallace Collection, Capwell addresses the realism of knightly combat in \"Henry V\" (1944), \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" (2005) and \"Game of Thrones\" (2011). Does chain mail look anything like it does in Netflix's \"Outlaw King\" (2018)? And would armor deflect arrows as in \"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\" (1999)? \n\nTobias Capwell is an author, lecturer, broadcaster, and the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. He has been a horseman and martial artist since childhood, is a founding member of the modern historical jousting community, and has fought in major international tournaments all over the world. Capwell has written many books and articles on weapons, armor, tournaments, and knighthood, including \"Armour of the English Knight 1400-1450,\" \"Arms and Armour of the Medieval Joust,\" and \"Masterpieces of European Arms and Armour in the Wallace Collection.\" In 2015 he had the honor of serving as one of the two fully armored knights who escorted the remains of King Richard III from the battlefield at Bosworth to their final resting place in Leicester Cathedral.\n\nFind out more about The Wallace Collection here: ",
