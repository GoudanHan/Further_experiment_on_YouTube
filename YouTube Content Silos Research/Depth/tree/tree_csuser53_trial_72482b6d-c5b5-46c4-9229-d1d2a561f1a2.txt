                            "description": "Professor Kip Thorne is a theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate. In this talk he discusses \"My Romance with the Warped Side of the Universe: from Black Holes and Wormholes to Time Travel and Gravitational Waves\".\n\nKip is a world-leading expert on the implications of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, from time travel to wormholes, and from black holes to gravitational waves. Until 2009 he was the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech, but has since retired to take up a new career in writing, and collaborations between science and art. He was executive producer and scientific adviser on Interstellar, the 2014 blockbuster film. One of Kip's key contributions was the visualisation of black holes and their surroundings, which contributed to the film winning an Oscar for \"Best Visual Effects\". Kip explained the science in the film in his 2014 book The Science of Interstellar. His many other multimedia projects have cemented his reputation to be able to explain complex concepts in ways that everyone can understand.\n\nAs one of the founders of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory), Kip was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves, along with Rainer Weiss and Barry C. Barish. The first detection of gravitational waves by LIGO (of which Cardiff University is a member) in 2015 confirmed a key part of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, and observations have continued to test one of science's most famous theories.",

                        "description": "The 2018 Reines Lecture was presented by Kip Thorne, winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for the detection of gravitational waves.  The discovery, part of the LIGO experiment, validated Albert Einstein\u2019s longstanding prediction that during cataclysmic events the fabric of spacetime can be stretched, sending gravitational tremors across the universe.  Thorne is a graduate of Caltech and Princeton University. His research has focused on Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity and on astrophysics, and he is co-founder of the LIGO Project.  Among his many distinctions, Thorne has been awarded the Albert Einstein Medal, the UNESCO Niels Bohr Gold Medal, the Common Wealth Award for Science, and was named California Scientists of the Year.  He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Russian Academy of Sciences.  In addition to his renowned scientific research in theoretical physics, he is involved in writing and movie production. Most notably, he worked on Christopher Nolan\u2019s film Interstellar.\n\nExploring the Universe with Gravitational Waves: From the Big Bang to Black Holes\n\nThere are two types of waves that can propagate across the universe: electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves. Galileo initiated electromagnetic astronomy 400 years ago by pointing a telescope at the sky and discovering the moons of Jupiter. LIGO recently initiated gravitational astronomy by observing gravitational waves from colliding black holes. Thorne will describe this discovery, the 50 year effort that led to it, and the rich explorations that lie ahead.\n\nThe Reines Lecture Series honors Frederick Reines, UCI\u2019s Founding Dean of Physical Sciences and co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize for discovering the neutrino.",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

He earned his B.A. from Trinity College and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Yale University. Recognized as an outstanding lecturer, Professor Harl has received numerous teaching awards at Tulane, including the coveted Sheldon H. Hackney Award. He has earned Tulane's annual Student Body Award for Excellence in Teaching nine times and is the recipient of Baylor University's nationwide Robert Foster Cherry Award for Great Teachers. \nAn expert on classical Anatolia, he has taken students with him into the field on excursions and to assist in excavations of Hellenistic and Roman sites in Turkey. Professor Harl has also published a wide variety of articles and books, including his current work on coins unearthed in an excavation of Gordion, Turkey, and a new book on Rome and her Iranian foes. A fellow and trustee of the American Numismatic Society, Professor Harl is well known for his studies of ancient coinage. He is the author of Civic Coins and Civic Politics in the Roman East, A.D. 180-275 and Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700.\nFor more information, please visit: ",

Lost Worlds travels to each site and through high-end computer graphics, lavish re-enactment and the latest archaeological evidence brings them to stunning televisual life. From the 900-year-old remains of Angkor Wat in the Cambodian jungle the staggering City of the God Kings is recreated. From Project Troia, in North West Turkey, the location of the biggest archaeological expedition ever mounted the lost city is stunningly visualised and finally from Persepolis the city and the great Persian Empire are brought to life.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...
