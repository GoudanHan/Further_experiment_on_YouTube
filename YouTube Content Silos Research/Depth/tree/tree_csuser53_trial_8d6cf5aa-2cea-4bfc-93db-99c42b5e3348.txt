This difficult challenge of completing six Mario games back to back in under an hour has long been part of speedrunning community lore, but where did it come from? Who has completed it? And where does the record stand today? \n\nAfter 9 months, I am so happy to finally share this video with you guys! Huge thanks to you for watching this video and my community for supporting me along the way. You guys are amazing and I just want to say thank you! :D\n\nWatch the Marihour grind live! ",

If you watched my Dark Souls Series, please let me know which method of presentation that you liked more. There were a few more jokes in this video and my intention was that they wouldn't interrupt the flow of what I was saying and feel natural.\n\nI also uploaded it all as one video instead of broken into parts like Dark Souls. Let me know if you liked this better, or would have preferred parts that you can use as breaks to come back later.\n\nAs I watched this back after uploading it, I noticed that I sound highly critical of Blizzard. They're still one of my favorite developers even after the statements I made at the end of this video. Hopefully I'm wrong with my guesses, or that even if I'm right that the changes will be positive.\n\nThanks for watching! If you like the stuff I do, you might want to subscribe to the channel. If you like me even MORE than that and want to support me (I like you too), the best way would be to check out my books found here:\n\nTwitter: ",

I just prefered the look of Heleus)\n \nCombat:\n-Turbocharge: UUD\n-Sniper Rifles: DDU\n-Combat Fitness: DDU\n-Combat Tools: UUU\n \nBiotics:\n-Backlash: UUD\n-Barrier: UDD\n \nTech:\n-Tactical Cloak: DDD\n-Team Support: UDD\n-Offensive Tech: UUD\n-Auxiliary Systems: UUD\n-(Optional) Invasion: UDD (Swap with Backlash. Synergises well with Isharay bio-converter/Life Support)\n \nSquad:\nI use Vetra + Cora (optional: Peebee or Jaal), just pick anything which makes the enemy weaker, and anything recharging your shield.\n \nHow to use?\nStart in stealth, then simply snipe anything you see. Shoot your first 4 shots, then use Turbocharge to instantly refill your ammo to 7 and continue shooting.\nWhen you have finished all 11 shots, stealth while reloading, and repeat. Use Backlash to block any damage you otherwise find unavoidable.\nThe abilities will boost your damage, while basicly keeping you unkillable. As long as you have full hp and shield you deal 20% extra damage, and as long as you kill stuff your shield will be kept full with the help from your armor upgrade and squad.\nNote that the cooldown on turbocharge might not be ready if you quickly shoot right after stealth reloading, you can just wait a bit in stealth before starting to shoot again though. You can also use Backlash to block incoming attacks and boost your damage while waiting.\n\nUsing Isharay, you want to use tech abilities to trigger health regen from Life support, to heal the damage you take from refilling your ammo.",
