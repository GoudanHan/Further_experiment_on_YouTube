It should not be considered extremely detailed or comprehensive - going through all of the contributions and discoveries would take too long and wouldn't flow particularly well. However, I cover all of the major discoveries and provide simplified explanations of the technical glitches. I also cover some of the more obscure but interesting details.\n\nThe video was somewhat rushed near the end of production and I didn't polish it as much as I would like. Hopefully you will enjoy it anyway, there are just some minor issues and editing errors (documented below). I will aim to improve my quality for future videos (this one is definitely a step up from my previous video).\n\n\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c:\n\nI referred to Mitjitsu as \"Mitijitsu\" at multiple places in the video. I wrote his name slightly wrong in the script and failed to double check - sorry about that! \n\nAt ",

But what worked as a free mod had some serious issues when making the transition to a standalone commercial game.

The player negotiates between choices in order to defeat a greater challenge. But what if you took away the challenge? What if there was nothing to defeat? What would negotiation between choices look like then? The Stanley Parable\u2019s Davey Wreden and William Pugh explain their theories (and lack thereof) about what happens next in this 2014 talk.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
