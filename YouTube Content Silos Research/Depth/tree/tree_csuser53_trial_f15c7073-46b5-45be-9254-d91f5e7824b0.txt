                            "description": "Steven Garfinkle - Commerce, Communication, and State Formation: Daily Life in an Ancient Mesopotamian City from a Merchant\u2019s Perspective   \nCities were the building blocks of civilization in early Mesopotamia. Literary texts like the Epic of Gilgamesh highlight the urban environment as the height of human development. The expansion of state power in these communities was often built around ensuring the productivity of commerce, both local and long distance, and protecting the accumulation of property. Much of this was an elite phenomenon, and these elites created the documentary record that we use to construct daily life. Commercial activity brought the communities of the ancient Near East together. This was true within communities as commerce supported the redistributive mechanisms within the early city-states and states of the region, and this was true across state boundaries as long distance trade networks arose to supply these communities with both staple and luxury goods unavailable in their local environments. The presentation will cover the mechanisms of exchange in early cities, the various goods and services that were exchanged, the ways in which communication was managed over long distances, and finally we will discuss how all of this activity shaped the development of states in early Mesopotamia.\nSteven Garfinkle is Professor of History at Western Washington University, where he has been a faculty member since 2001. He teaches a broad range of courses on the ancient world. His research focuses on social and economic history in early Mesopotamia with an emphasis on the origins of commerce and state formation. Steven is a past recipient of a research fellowship rom the National Endowment for the Humanities, and he received the outstanding Faculty Leadership Award at Western for 2015-16. He is a member of the board of directors for the International Association for Assyriology and the American Oriental Society, and he is the chair of the Committee on Mesopotamian Civilization for the American Schools of Oriental Research. Steven has authored and edited several books, including Entrepreneurs and Enterprise in Early Mesopotamia (2012), along with numerous articles. He is the editor of the Journal of Ancient Near Eastern History.\nFor more information, please visit: ",

He didn't like it much, so he decided to make a 14-part series about how dumb I am. He really pulled out all the stops, parading all of his classic fallacious talking points, with plenty of bald-faced lies and deliberate misrepresentations of scientific research peppered in for good measure. Honestly, I was rather shocked at how stupid it was. With so much material to work with, I ended up with quite a lot to say in response, and had to split it into two parts.\n\nIn this Part 1, we discuss how James pretends to be an expert on origin of life research but objectively isn't, and how he deliberately ignores mountains of research regarding the emergence of homochirality.\n\nPart 2 of this response: ",

Isn't life way too complex for that to happen? It seems ridiculous, right? Well, no. Not if you understand biochemistry, which creationists do not. But every once in a while, a hero emerges from academia to champion the cause of the creationist, and lend some illusory credence to their views. In this case, that hero is James Tour, a synthetic organic chemist who insists that abiogenesis is impossible, and he should know better than anyone, because he's a chemist. I was made aware of Dr. Tour after a couple hundred people linked me to a video of his in an empty argument from authority, insisting that because a chemist confirms their religious bias, they must be right. But is Dr. Tour a bit biased himself? Let's find out precisely what his agenda is, shall we?\n\nUpdate: James Tour responded to this single video with a dumpster fire of a 14-part series overflowing with stupidity and lies, which qualifies for the Dunning-Kruger Hall of Fame. Naturally I tore through it like tissue paper, so to watch me do that please check out my two-part response which exposes his fraudulence ten times more thoroughly than this video:\nPart 1: ",

                "description": "A channel named Modern Day Debate reached out to me based on my flat earth debunking to see if I would debate someone named Kent Hovind about Young Earth Creationism. Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
