Transforming Hong Kong: Influence of western ideas through education and the expansion of its population and economy\n3. The Toll of War: Hong Kong through the conflicts of WW1 and WW2\n4. Post War Chaos: Communist revolution and the start of the Cold War \n5. Post War Recovery: Economic miracle that transformed Hong Kong into a jewel of the east\n6. Final Days of British Empire Rule: British Colonial government implements many changes to improve the colony and solidify their influence\n7. Transfer to China: Talks about the future of Hong Kong with the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 and the passing of the Basic Law in 1990\n8.

But nothing is truly out of bounds for science. If it's real, it can be studied, and tested. Perhaps the greatest misunderstanding our culture has about the scientific method involves the definition of the word \"theory\". A theory is not a guess, and this word does not in any way imply uncertainty about the validity of a concept or an equation.

This is the notion that the positions of the stars and planets in the sky at the moment of your birth have an influence on your characteristics, and that their positions over time influence daily events. Can this be possible? By what mechanism does this influence propagate? If it's true, why haven't we encountered anything like this in our study of astronomy? Shouldn't we be able to do experiments to test its validity? We sure can. Let's take a real good look at what astrology proposes, and see if we can to the bottom of whether there is any truth to it or not.\n\nLarge-scale study showing no correlation between date of birth and personality: ",

            "description": "I know that I've become known for my flat earth destructions, but now that I've driven that one so far into the ground that it's coming out the other side of the spherical earth, it's time to tackle some other topics. There exists an obscure fad called the electric universe, which tends to attract exemplars of the Dunning-Kruger effect who think they understand physics better than Einstein. Literally. Although not quite as ridiculous as the flat earth, it's still pretty ridiculous, so let's go through the finer points of precisely why that is the case, shall we?\n\nWatch my other debunks: ",

        "description": "Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!\n\nMy original video: ",
