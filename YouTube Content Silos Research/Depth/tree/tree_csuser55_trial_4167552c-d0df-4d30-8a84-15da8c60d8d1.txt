They're destroying India's reputation around the world with every single scam call. So, I'm taking you to a scam call centre in India to show you exactly how these call centres are scamming foreigners for hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\n\nEven a small scam call centre like this one can make over $500,000 USD a year. Usually, they scam elderly computer-illiterate people out of between $400 - $1600. They do this by placing pop-up windows on websites which trick the person into phoning them to \"get rid of a virus.\" It's all a scam and a lie and the person's computer has no virus at all. These scammers prey on our naivety and people who are less savvy with computers.\n\nPlease see Jim Brownings video ",

It's like cut and paste for DNA.\n\nScientists are already using CRISPR to introduce genes for disease resistance into wheat and insert malaria-blocking genes into mosquitoes. CRISPR could even allow us to eliminate certain genetic diseases in humans.\n\nBut we didn't invent CRISPR \u2013 instead we borrowed it from microbes like bacteria and archaea.\n\nWatch this video to learn more about how these micro-organisms use CRISPR to fend off parasites like viruses, and how we've adapted it into a game-changing gene editing tool.\n\nMicrobiology Today is the Society's quarterly magazine. The content is balanced to meet the needs of the Society\u2019s members. The magazine aims to provide informative and enjoyable broad-interest articles for all readers, including parliamentarians and policy-makers. Each issue focuses on a topic, and topics are chosen with the aim of covering all fields of microbiology.\n\nRead more about CRISPR-Cas in the August 2016 issue of Microbiology Today: ",
