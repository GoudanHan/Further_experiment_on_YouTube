            "description": "The massive scope of the MCU has allowed Marvel Studios to create a sprawling, interconnected universe built on a shared continuity, and much like the comics the movies are based on, that means things can get pretty complicated.\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't start with Tony Stark getting kidnapped in 2008, Carol Danvers being taken to Hala in the '90s, or even with Steve Rogers volunteering for the Super Soldier program in the '40s. Instead, like most universes, this one starts at the Big Bang. \n \nGoing chronologically, the first event we see in the MCU is the creation of the Infinity Stones. As the Collector explains in Guardians of the Galaxy, they were formed from the \"six singularities\" that caused the universe to explode into existence, before being scattered across the universe. \n\nThat, of course, was billions of years ago, but \"millions of years\" before we get to the present-day MCU, Ego the Living Planet comes into existence and starts seeding worlds with his essence in an attempt to create another Celestial being like himself.\n\nWatch the video to see the entire MCU timeline explained!",

        "description": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi have hatched a whole new scheme to federalize elections. How? They gutted a NASA bill that had already been passed by the House and had made its way to the Senate floor, stripping out the language and replacing it with language that federalizes our elections. \n\nACLJ Director of Government Affairs Thann Bennett explained how this bill was stripped down to be used for hyper-partisan legislation: \n\n\"Can you imagine being the supporters of that NASA authority bill right now when it is now being used to take over elections, move state control of elections to the federal government? You and I both know how hard it is to move a bill through the legislative process. Imagine getting a bill through the United States Senate and it sitting in the House, may even have enough votes to pass in the House, they call it up and remove all of the language that you care about and put in a federal takeover of elections. . . . That is how insistent Washington D.C. Democrats are in taking over control of the elections. It doesn\u2019t even remove that 60-vote threshold, it just pushes it a couple of days later, but that\u2019s how desperate they are to move it down the line.\"\n\nThann added that the substance of the bill is still the same as H.R.1 that we warned you about: \n\n\"It is a federal takeover of elections plain and simple. They changed the bill name from S. 1 the For the People Act, now it is numbered S. 2747 the Freedom to Vote Act and they put Joe Manchin\u2019s name on it. They did very little to change the substance of this. The federal government would still be in charge of everything \u2013 to voter registration, to voter location, to voter hours, to when those polls have to be open, to ballot box security, redistricting would even be under the purview of the federal government now. I am telling you this is as sweeping as H.R. 1 was, they just changed the name and tried to make it a little bit more palpable. . . . The only thing they did with that sleight of hand was get it to the Senate floor. There will still have to be a vote on whether or not they will change the filibuster to actually get it over the line.\"\n\nSenator Schumer is pushing to get rid of the filibuster, yet he used to have a very different opinion on the matter. Senator Tom Cotton pointed that out: \n\n\"Constitutional scholars will tell us that the reason we have these rules in the Senate \u2013 unlimited debate, two-thirds to change the rules, the idea that 60 have to close off debate \u2013 is embodied in the spirit and rule of the Constitution. . . . This is what the Constitution is all about, and we all know it. . . . The bottom line is very simple. The ideologues in the Senate want to turn what the Founding Fathers called the cooling saucer of democracy into the rubber stamp of dictatorship. . . . Those are powerful words \u2013 but they\u2019re not mine. Every word of my speech today was originally spoken by my esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from New York, Chuck Schumer.\"\n\nWhat changed? What changed is that Sen. Schumer and the Left fear the fast-approaching midterm elections, and are terrified of losing their power. They want to federalize elections while they still control the House, Senate, and White House. \n\nSign: NO Federal Takeover of Elections: ",

Damn, this sounds epic. Well actually, it was. I AM Ryan Hayashi, this is my YouTube channel, and I am writing about myself. This was one of the most epic and emotional moments of my life. It was a very special performance for me, showing magic to two of my heroes in magic. I was staring them in the eyes and performing for them the whole time, and I was nearly in tears walking off that stage. When they found me backstage after the show and gave me more kind words, I lost my mind. I'm normally a solid performer, but looking at this video, my precision, stage presence and comedic timing were off the chart! I hope you enjoy watching this performance as much as I do. This aired on July 9, 2018 on Season 5 of Fool Us. Ryan Hayashi",
