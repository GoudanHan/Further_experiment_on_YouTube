Sadly remembered for her defeat in her last battle against 227 American aircraft, which became a demonstrative execution and ended with the giant being defeated and the hopes of the Japanese command crashed.\n\nBuilt in secret, and at great expense, she emerged as the largest battleship in history.\n\nBorn to terrify her enemies, she'd cost eight billion USD to build in today's dollars. She represents the pinnacle of battleship building, but launched at a key turning point in naval warfare history. The rise of aircraft-based naval combat left her immensely powerful, but ill-equipped to fight sustained air attacks. Still, nothing captures the imagination of naval aficionados quite like Yamato. There's a mountain of knowledge just below the surface.

                "description": "When Sir Geoffrey de Havilland first pitched his idea for a two-seater bomber made of wood with no armament, few people were willing to accept his design. But the de Havilland Mosquito went on to become one of the most successful and popular aircraft of the Second World War. The defence of this bomber would be its speed. Mosquitos were among the first multi-role combat aircraft: they could be turned to anything and excelled at everything they did. They were popular with pilots and were adapted into numerous different roles to great success. In this video, our Duxford expert Graham Rodgers tells us how this little wooden bomber came into action, and we hear from some of those who experienced its power first-hand. \n\nGet tickets to Duxford\u2019s Air Show on 18 and 19 September 2021: ",

It was the Luftwaffe\u2019s only single seat fighter for the first few years of the Second World War and the RAF\u2019s nemesis during the Battle of Britain. Duxford\u2019s Bf 109 is an E-3/E-4 variant. It was attacked by Spitfires in late 1940 and crash-landed in a field in relatively good condition. Because of this smooth crash landing, the aircraft ended up touring North America before going on display at IWM \u2013 the tourists\u2019 graffiti from these tours can still be seen on its wings. In this video, Curator Adrian Kerrison shows us how much we can learn from looking closely this Battle of Britain icon. Take a look into the cockpit, watch it take off, and hear from those who flew the Bf 109 during World War Two. \n\nBook tickets to Duxford's Battle of Britain Air Show 18 & 19 September: ",

        "description": "The Supermarine Spitfire is one of the most iconic aircraft of all time. Between 1937 and 1947 over 20,000 of them were built and in those 10 years, Spitfires changed dramatically from the Mk 1 to the Mk 24. More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world. In this episode of Duxford in Depth, Graham Rodgers looks at how the Spitfire evolved by taking us through just a few of Duxford's collection of Spitfires including marks 1, 5, 9, 14, and 24.\n\nFrom 27 December until 20 February, see a world-first at IWM Duxford \u2013 the largest collection of Spitfires ever assembled under one roof! Get up close to twelve Spitfires of varying marks side by side on display for a limited time only: ",
