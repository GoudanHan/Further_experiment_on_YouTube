                            "description": "In Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.\n\nBeautifully written, original, and revealing, this brilliant book is an eye-opening story of people and history, and a reexamination of what lies under the surface of ordinary lives and of American life today.\n\nWilkerson will be in conversation with Bryan Stevenson, the founder and Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), a human rights organization in Montgomery, Alabama. He is also the author of the award winning book Just Mercy, which was recently adapted as a major motion picture. \n\nPurchase Book Here: ",

[It] demonstrates, as powerfully as any book on criminal justice that I\u2019ve ever read, the extent to which brutality, unfairness, and racial bias continue to infect criminal law in the United States. But at the same time that [Bryan] Stevenson tells an utterly damning story of deep-seated and widespread injustice, he also recounts instances of human compassion, understanding, mercy, and justice that offer hope. . . . Just Mercy is a remarkable amalgam, at once a searing indictment of American criminal justice and a stirring testament to the salvation that fighting for the vulnerable sometimes yields.\u201d\n\u2014David Cole, The New York Review of Books\n\n\u201cA searing, moving and infuriating memoir . . . Bryan Stevenson may, indeed, be America\u2019s Mandela. For decades he has fought judges, prosecutors and police on behalf of those who are impoverished, black or both. . . . Injustice is easy not to notice when it affects people different from ourselves; that helps explain the obliviousness of our own generation to inequity today. We need to wake up. And that is why we need a Mandela in this country.\u201d\n\u2014Nicholas Kristof, The New York Times\n\nThis event was held on April 1, 2015.",

Some people will smugly inform you that the Sword in the Stone isn't Excalibur; some will equally smugly tell you that the stone was actually an anvil. Is Merlin a druid, a wizard, a demon, a time-traveler? Is Morgan Le Fay Arthur's sister, nemesis, lover, all of the above? And where the hell does Mordred fit into all this? To answer these questions, let's go all the way back to the beginning and trace how this mythos grew and evolved as it moved from writer to writer and culture to culture. And this is a long one, so strap in, folks!\n\nWould you believe there's no guitar tab for \"C'est Moi\" anywhere online? So inconsiderate.\n\nPATREON: www.patreon.com/user?u=4664797\n\nMERCH LINKS:\nShirts - ",
