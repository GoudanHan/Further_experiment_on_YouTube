First, Dave shares some of the most cringe-worthy moments from yesterday\u2019s Biden press conference. It was filled with stumbling, nonsensical statements, a call for more social media censorship, and ignored any questions from the press. Next, Dave discusses the Supreme Court\u2019s mixed rulings in a pair of cases challenging the Biden administration COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The Supreme Court blocked the OSHA vaccine mandate for large businesses, but upheld the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers. Finally, Dave shares a clip of Ronald Reagan where he describes how big government can entrench itself in our lives and the slippery slope that can lead to totalitarianism and authoritarianism. It\u2019s hard to articulate the slippery slope argument better than the great communicator himself, as he calls for a more limited government.\n\n----------\n\nWatch The Rubin Report on BlazeTV:",

This means that there are often more writing and language mistakes made in these sections than others in the paper, including the Methods and Results. \n\nIn this seminar, Worvice/EssayReview Senior Editor Kevin J. Heintz breaks down the structure and content of these sections, providing an in-depth analysis of their various functions (e.g., background, literature review, purpose statement, implications, and conclusion). This seminar also includes language templates with commonly used verbs and key phrases to show you how to build a scaffolding for your well-written paper from the ground up.\n\nThroughout the lecture, we examine a few common writing mistakes made by novice and ESL authors (and even some made by ALL researchers) and show you how to correct them before submitting to your target journal.\n\nLecture Content",

This is sensible: academics who work outside academia are endlessly criticized for writing \"like a professor\".  Worse, writers who are criticized in this way are often baffled at how to adapt to their new world.  Very often, they try to change aspects of their writing that are not troublesome, and they leave in place aspects of their writing that are making their writing less clear, less logical, and less valuable to their readers. \n\nThis session will be about a few patterns of writing that are likely to aggravate non-academic readers.  We'll focus on patterns that are often difficult for academics to see, but are actually fairly easy to change.",

Organizational psychologist Adam Grant studies \"originals\": thinkers who dream up new ideas and take action to put them into the world. In this talk, learn three unexpected habits of originals \u2014 including embracing failure. \"The greatest originals are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most,\" Grant says. \"You need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones.\"\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

By seeking out rejection for 100 days -- from asking a stranger to borrow $100 to requesting a \"burger refill\" at a restaurant -- Jiang desensitized himself to the pain and shame that rejection often brings and, in the process, discovered that simply asking for what you want can open up possibilities where you expect to find dead ends.\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).
