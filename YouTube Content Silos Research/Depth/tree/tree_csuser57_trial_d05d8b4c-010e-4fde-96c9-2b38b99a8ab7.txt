This is sensible: academics who work outside academia are endlessly criticized for writing \"like a professor\".  Worse, writers who are criticized in this way are often baffled at how to adapt to their new world.  Very often, they try to change aspects of their writing that are not troublesome, and they leave in place aspects of their writing that are making their writing less clear, less logical, and less valuable to their readers. \n\nThis session will be about a few patterns of writing that are likely to aggravate non-academic readers.  We'll focus on patterns that are often difficult for academics to see, but are actually fairly easy to change.",

By seeking out rejection for 100 days -- from asking a stranger to borrow $100 to requesting a \"burger refill\" at a restaurant -- Jiang desensitized himself to the pain and shame that rejection often brings and, in the process, discovered that simply asking for what you want can open up possibilities where you expect to find dead ends.\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

[It] demonstrates, as powerfully as any book on criminal justice that I\u2019ve ever read, the extent to which brutality, unfairness, and racial bias continue to infect criminal law in the United States. But at the same time that [Bryan] Stevenson tells an utterly damning story of deep-seated and widespread injustice, he also recounts instances of human compassion, understanding, mercy, and justice that offer hope. . . . Just Mercy is a remarkable amalgam, at once a searing indictment of American criminal justice and a stirring testament to the salvation that fighting for the vulnerable sometimes yields.\u201d\n\u2014David Cole, The New York Review of Books\n\n\u201cA searing, moving and infuriating memoir . . . Bryan Stevenson may, indeed, be America\u2019s Mandela. For decades he has fought judges, prosecutors and police on behalf of those who are impoverished, black or both. . . . Injustice is easy not to notice when it affects people different from ourselves; that helps explain the obliviousness of our own generation to inequity today. We need to wake up. And that is why we need a Mandela in this country.\u201d\n\u2014Nicholas Kristof, The New York Times\n\nThis event was held on April 1, 2015.",

I have been warning everyone since last year about what these \"fact-checkers\" represent, and we are inching ever-closer to a totalitarian state. I began suing the fact-checkers last year because I knew that their actions would culminate into this extraordinary moment in American history: a sitting President of the United States has been censored. This means none of us are safe from being wiped away. My Facebook page has long since been demonetized but I believe we can make this video viral by sharing person to person. I still believe in the power of the people.",
