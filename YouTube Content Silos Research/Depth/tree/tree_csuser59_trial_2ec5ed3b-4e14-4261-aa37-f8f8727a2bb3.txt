His book, The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great, is a New York Times bestseller.\n\nIn a spiky Politics Live interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Shapiro refers to an incident which took place between Trump campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski and Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields in 2016.\n\nAlthough a charge was brought at the time against Mr Lewandowski, Florida prosecutors dropped the case.\n\nThis is an unedited version of their interview, which was terminated by Mr Shapiro.",
