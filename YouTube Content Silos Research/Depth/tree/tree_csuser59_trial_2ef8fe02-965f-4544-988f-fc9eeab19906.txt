He didn't like it much, so he decided to make a 14-part series about how dumb I am. He really pulled out all the stops, parading all of his classic fallacious talking points, with plenty of bald-faced lies and deliberate misrepresentations of scientific research peppered in for good measure. Honestly, I was rather shocked at how stupid it was. With so much material to work with, I ended up with quite a lot to say in response, and had to split it into two parts.\n\nIn this Part 2, we examine how James is lying about our progress towards prebiotic syntheses of all the major classes of biomolecules, and when it comes to cells, James would rather mislead his viewers with dazzling animations of modern eukaryotic cells than actually dig into the relevant literature. If you thought Part 1 was devastating, strap in.\n\nPart 1 of this response: ",

Also, did you know that water responds to emotions, and has memory, just like humans? No wait, that's another lie with zero substantiation. Man, people really lie a lot about water, don't they?

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, watch for his signature move, the gish gallop.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates: ",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

Harris posits that science can -- and should -- be an authority on moral issues, shaping human values and setting out what constitutes a good life. \nAlong the way, this talk ventures down the avenue of debunking religion as humanity's sole method of dictating between right and wrong.\n\nThis lecture was presented On Oct. 7, 2010 by the Center for Inquiry in New York City. The event was held at the New York Society for Ethical Culture. \nThis is the full video, including both the talk and question-and-answer session.\n\nCheck out more of our reasonable talks: ",
