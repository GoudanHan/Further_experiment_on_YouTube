[It] demonstrates, as powerfully as any book on criminal justice that I\u2019ve ever read, the extent to which brutality, unfairness, and racial bias continue to infect criminal law in the United States. But at the same time that [Bryan] Stevenson tells an utterly damning story of deep-seated and widespread injustice, he also recounts instances of human compassion, understanding, mercy, and justice that offer hope. . . . Just Mercy is a remarkable amalgam, at once a searing indictment of American criminal justice and a stirring testament to the salvation that fighting for the vulnerable sometimes yields.\u201d\n\u2014David Cole, The New York Review of Books\n\n\u201cA searing, moving and infuriating memoir . . . Bryan Stevenson may, indeed, be America\u2019s Mandela. For decades he has fought judges, prosecutors and police on behalf of those who are impoverished, black or both. . . . Injustice is easy not to notice when it affects people different from ourselves; that helps explain the obliviousness of our own generation to inequity today. We need to wake up. And that is why we need a Mandela in this country.\u201d\n\u2014Nicholas Kristof, The New York Times\n\nThis event was held on April 1, 2015.",
