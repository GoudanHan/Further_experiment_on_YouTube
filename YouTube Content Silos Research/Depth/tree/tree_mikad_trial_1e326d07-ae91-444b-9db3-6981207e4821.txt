Economist Yanis Varoufakis, the former Minister of Finance for Greece, says that it's because you can be in politics today but not be in power \u2014 because real power now belongs to those who control the economy. He believes that the mega-rich and corporations are cannibalizing the political sphere, causing financial crisis. In this talk, hear his dream for a world in which capital and labor no longer struggle against each other, \"one that is simultaneously libertarian, Marxist and Keynesian.\"\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

Tett and Varoufakis both agree that the current model of capitalism needs to change  but they differ radically in the solutions they proffer. \n\nGillian Tett is the pioneering columnist who has spent the last decade documenting the rise of \u2018conscious capitalism\u2019, a movement led by businesses that have concluded they can no longer afford to ignore issues like climate change, income inequality and social justice. Yanis Varoufakis is the former Greek finance minister who oversaw the bailout crisis in 2015 and has spent the last decade calling for a kinder vision for the global economy.\n\nIs capitalism past its sell by date? Or can it be reinvented for the digital age?\n\nAbout Intelligence Squared: \n\nIntelligence Squared has established itself as the leading forum for live, agenda-setting debates, talks and discussions around the world.\n\nOur aim is to promote a global conversation that enables people to make informed decisions about the issues that matter, in the company of the world's greatest minds and orators.\n\nClick here to subscribe on Apple Podcasts and receive our audio podcasts as soon as they are released: ",

He is currently a Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the New School University in New York City. He wrote Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism and founded www.democracyatwork.info, a non-profit advocacy organization of the same name that promotes democratic workplaces as a key path to a stronger, democratic economic system.\n\nProfessor Wolff discusses the economic dimensions of our lives, our jobs, our incomes, our debts, those of our children, and those looming down the road in his unique mixture of deep insight and dry humor. He presents current events and draws connections to the past to highlight the machinations of our global economy. He helps us to understand political and corporate policy, organization of labor, the distribution of goods and services, and challenges us to question some of the deepest foundations of our society.
