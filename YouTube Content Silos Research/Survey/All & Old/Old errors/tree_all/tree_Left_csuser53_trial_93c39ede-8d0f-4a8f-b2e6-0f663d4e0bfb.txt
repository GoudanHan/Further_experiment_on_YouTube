We explore topics like niche-switching, what Darwin got wrong, Twitter, sources for modern values, hyper-novelty, the aftermath of progress, parenthood, and sexual selection \u2013 just to name a few.\nBret Weinstein and Heather Heying are evolutionary biologists, former Evergreen State College professors, and the current hosts of the DarkHorse podcast. You may also know Bret through Joe Rogan, or as the twice-moderator for Jordan\u2019s debates with Sam Harris. \nThe couple\u2019s book, titled \u201cA Hunter-Gatherer\u2019s Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life,\u201d asks why the most prosperous age in history has scarcely offset suicide rates, tribal division, loneliness, and human misery.\n\nFollow Bret at: ",
