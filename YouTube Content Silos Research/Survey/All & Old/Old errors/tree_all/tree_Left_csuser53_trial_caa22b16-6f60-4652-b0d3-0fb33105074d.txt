They\u2019re on the news [Bezos space launch], have their own TV shows, movies, and even make their way to elected office. Specifically, we consistently give massive audiences to \u201cself-made\u201d billionaires, the people who, unlike the aristocrats and monarchs of yore, didn\u2019t simply inherit their wealth. In this episode, we\u2019re talking about the obsession with so-called \u201cself-made\u201d billionaires, how misleading that term can be, and everything wrong with the myth of the \u201cself-made person.\u201d\n\n\nThe Myth Of The \"Self-Made\" Billionaire \u2013 Second Thought\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: ",
