Some will allow you to bypass item limits, convert resources into different materials, and even fill rooms with enhancement cores. In this video I go over 10 useful tricks that you never knew existed. All of these tricks can also be done completely solo so anyone can do them on their own. Using these methods you can buy legendary shards with glimmer, store large amounts of glimmer in your vault, break down enhancment cores, enhancement prisms, and ascendant shards, and much more! If you knew about any of these or know of any other useful tricks, share them in the comments! ",
