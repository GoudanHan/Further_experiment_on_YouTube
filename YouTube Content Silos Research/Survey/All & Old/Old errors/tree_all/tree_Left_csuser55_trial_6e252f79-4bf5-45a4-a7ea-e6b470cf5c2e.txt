Of course Spiff is going to be ignoring all of these updates and new secret societies game mode and instead playing the strangest and most challenging game of Civ 6 yet. The Spiffing Brit will be trying to win the Game without settling a city! Thats right a No City Win Only Challenge! Is it even possible to win a game without placing down your settler and getting one city. Well it turns out Spiff has found a way! So is Civ 6 a perfectly balanced game WITH NO EXPLOITS, Except for the maori and the no city challenge. So is spiff going for a conquest victory, science victory, tourism or perhaps a diplomatic victory! Who knows what he can even do HE DOESNT HAVE A CITY!!!! He cant research and he cant make any money so what can he do! I guess he has found a way to break the game so lets find out. Surely Civilization vi is a perfectly balanced game ;)\n\nSo sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Civilization 6 is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if the No City Only Challenge is broken!! How can you even win a game of civ without settling a city! This is almost 100X better than the civ 6 one city challenge videos ;)\n\nThis video game exploit video will be jam packed with a best bits funny moments montage style of editing similar to that of Valefisk, Robbaz and RTgame.
