                    "description": "18 Strangest Cat Behaviors Explained. Here is the list of unusual cat behaviors. \n\nChewing on plastic\nIf your cat is chewing on plastic, blankets, furniture or other things they shouldn\u2019t be chewing on, they may have pica.  Cats often get pica from anxiety or disorders in their gut. \n\n\nItation of the ears \nEars movement is an indication that your cat is feeling uncomfortable or anxious about something in their environment. If their ears aren\u2019t moving independently and are only slightly pulled back they are alert and listening to what is going on around them.\n\n Not covering Their Litter\nIn the wild, cats dig a hole when the need to poop. When they are done, they cover it up to hide their scent from predators.  If your cat isn\u2019t covering their poop it is best to take them to the vet to eliminate the possibility of a paw injury or urinary tract infection. \n\nknock off everything!\n Cats feel their surrounding with their paws which are incredibly sensitive. By knocking things over they satisfy their curiosity, seeing exactly what will happen when they touch something.  \n\nNumber 10 \u2013 Tiger Eyes - narrow pupils. cat's pupil. \nThis usually stems from their predatory response and they are probably focused on their next bit of prey. This could be because they want to play and have fun with you, or that they have set their sights on a bug to hunt. \n\n\nNumber 9 - Rubbing\nAs a cat owner, one of the things you would notice the most is how they rub up against you with their head.  This behavior is called bunting. \n\nNumber 8 - Biting their nails\nOne of those reasons is keeping their nails clean and short. It could be thought that your furry friend is anxious or has a bad habit. Like people, cats can bite their nails when they are bored or if they feel anxious. And just like people, this can become a bad habit that is difficult to break. You will need to try and find out if your cat is just nervous or if they are bored and need some form of play or entertainment. \n\nNumber 7 - Crazy Runs \nYour cat may start sprinting around your house or apartment, bouncing off of the walls and furniture without any warning.  Naturally, cats can run up to thirty miles per hour and when they are kept indoors all day they energy becomes pent up. \n\nNumber 6 \u2013 Sleeping on your laptop \ncats like the warmth of your laptop. Cats like temperatures of 20 degrees higher than human\u2019s ideal temperature. \nNumber 5 - Eating your houseplants \nCats bite and chew plants for a variety of reasons. In the wild, indigestion is often cured by eating grass, so if they are feeling a little gassy they may start munching on your plants. \n\n\nNumber 4 \u2013 Crazy Legs\nCats sleeping exposing belly. sometimes laying down or sitting with your legs and arms sprawled is incredibly comfortable and relaxing. \n\n\n\nNumber 3 \u2013 2:00am Cat Calls\nSome cats enjoy a little night time singing. This can become extremely annoying, especially when you do not get to laze around all day and sleep like your cat does. There can be quite a few reasons why your cat is howling at night. \n\n\n\n\n\nNumber 2 - Straight from the tap \nGenerally, cats are not a great fan of water but a running tap seems to be their favorite drinking spot. Running water is clean and free of disease where still water usually contains all kinds of bacteria that may be harmful to your cat.",

                "description": "In this video, we\u2019ll show you 10 proven ways to get a cat to love you.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet them make the first move\nCats are so adorable that people want to greet them with a big hug. Some people go up to the cat, corner them, and try to pet them to win them over. But remember, this is a common mistake for cat lovers. According to the recent studies, it\u2019s best to let the cat make the first move. A study conducted in Switzerland has shown that when humans sit back and wait\u2014and focus on something else, like reading a book\u2014cats are more likely to approach.\nThis is why many kitties are attracted to allergic people\u2014as people with allergies don\u2019t really seek out to pet cats. \nPet them where they enjoy it most\nHow does your cat enjoy being pet? \nA study conducted by the University of Lincoln i found that cats show more positive behavioral responses\u2014like purring or kneading\u2014when they are pet between the eyes and ears. And they display more negative responses\u2014like hissing, swatting or swishing their tails\u2014when they are pet around their tail area. \nYes, that\u2019s right. Cats don\u2019t actually enjoy being stroked at the base of their tail. Researchers believe that a cat\u2019s tail area is an erogenous zone.\nCheck your scent\nA cat's sense of smell is the main way they identify people and objects. Their sense of smell is 14 times better than that of humans. If a cat is afraid of you, make sure to check your scent as your cat might be staying clear of it. \nYou may have the scent of another cat or dog on your pants, or you may have strong smells like perfume, deodorizers, disinfectants, bleach, garlic or onions on your clothing. If your cat retreats when they sniff your hands, it may be because they don\u2019t like the smell of your hand soap. \nApproach them like a cat \nCats communicate primarily through scent and body language. Most felines greet each other with a nose-to-nose stiff. \nAnd while humans shake hands, cats boop to say hello.  \nTo increase your bond with a cat, try approaching them the way they would greet other felines. Mimic the nose-to-nose behavior by gently offering your non-threatening fingertip at their nose level. Your finger acts like a nose substitute and most cats will walk up and sniff or investigate your finger, \nMimic felines\u2019 scents\nCats, on the other hand, don\u2019t like new smells, and any unfamiliar scent can put them off. \nAnd this is why most cats are not big fans of change, relocation, or strangers. As new environments bring a lot of new smells and signs that they have yet to explore. \n If you don\u2019t want to bring new smells to a cat\u2019s home, you may spray yourself with a cat pheromone.\nPheromones are a type of chemical communication that all cats use to interact with each other and the environment around them. These \u201cmessages\u201d are released from the scent glands around their body. you may want to spray yourself  to calm a new cat. \nHuman interaction over food\nA 2017 research conducted in the Oregon State University studied what attracts cats the most. \nThe scientists offered cats a choice between food, toys, scent, and social interaction with humans and watched what happens. Believe it or not, they found that most cats prefer social interaction with humans over everything else \u2014 even food. Interestingly enough, some recent studies suggest that what really attracts cats to humans is the presence of interactive toys.\nDon\u2019t block the exits.\nIf you appear as an imposing, enormous creature in their space, they may perceive you as a threat. Instead, get down and approach them at their level. And make sure not to block the exits. \nBlink slowly, but never stare\nCats stare when they are hunting. Their ability to stare without regular blinking helps them keep a close eye on their prey. If you stare at them, you are giving them the same look they give when they hunt. \nInstead, give them plenty of long, slow blinks. This shows the cat that you are relaxed and friendly, and you don\u2019t want to hunt them. \nRetreat at the right time \nThere are many signs that a cat doesn\u2019t like your actions or feels uncomfortable around you. \nSome signs are overt\u2014like hissing and biting\u2014but some are more subtle--like when they flatten their ears, or twitch their tails. If you get one of these signals, it\u2019s time to back off.\nUse Treats Strategically\nYou can encourage your cat to be near you with a yummy, stinky treat. This doesn\u2019t mean showering them with treats all day long. Instead, use treats strategically to either reward good social interactions with you, or to entice a shy cat to walk towards you. \nYou can also try talking quietly to the cat as they eat the treats so they associate your voice with rewards.\nAnd while a dog may wolf down any kind of dog food you bring them, a cat will not. Cats are not very food-motivated so you might have to search for a treat that they like.",
