Then he repeats\u2026 fighting for the soul of a nation\u2014this is a line that he started using in at least 2019\u2026 This doesn\u2019t resonate with moderates, with independents, the very people who were turned away from him. But then he also made up, you talked about the time he got arrested during a civil rights march. Just like he talked about he was arrested in South Africa once trying to\u2026 see Nelson Mandela. He, you know, defended the Black Panthers in court. These are all just fables that he spouts'\n\nSubscribe to Fox Business! ",

I have been warning everyone since last year about what these \"fact-checkers\" represent, and we are inching ever-closer to a totalitarian state. I began suing the fact-checkers last year because I knew that their actions would culminate into this extraordinary moment in American history: a sitting President of the United States has been censored. This means none of us are safe from being wiped away. My Facebook page has long since been demonetized but I believe we can make this video viral by sharing person to person.
