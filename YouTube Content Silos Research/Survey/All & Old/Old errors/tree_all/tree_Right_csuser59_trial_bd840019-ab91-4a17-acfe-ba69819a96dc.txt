Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. \n\nHanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. \n\nHanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers. \n\nFor further information: ",

In this frank, no-holds-barred conversation, they discuss the United States\u2019 mission in Afghanistan: how it began, how it was conducted, and its ignominious end. McMaster and Hanson debate what worked and what failed, how social issues in the United States may have influenced our mission in Afghanistan and our decision to leave, and whether or not the United States should have continued to maintain a presence instead of leaving in a matter of weeks, abandoning thousands of Afghans loyal to the US mission there (as well as an unknown number of US citizens) after 20 years of military operations in the country.\n\nFor further information: ",

And second, just before Uncle Joe was going to speak to the Senate Democratic conference, Kyrsten Sinema stood up on the Senate floor and announced her unequivocal opposition to any changes in the legislative filibuster. By the way, Joe Manchin followed on Sinema's heels by issuing his own statement opposing a filibuster change. He did it last night just before Biden was to speak to the Senate Democrats. \n...\nSubscribe to Fox Business! ",
