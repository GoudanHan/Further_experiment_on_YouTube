And second, just before Uncle Joe was going to speak to the Senate Democratic conference, Kyrsten Sinema stood up on the Senate floor and announced her unequivocal opposition to any changes in the legislative filibuster. By the way, Joe Manchin followed on Sinema's heels by issuing his own statement opposing a filibuster change. He did it last night just before Biden was to speak to the Senate Democrats. \n...\nSubscribe to Fox Business! ",

Unvaccinated American truckers cannot enter Canada, while unvaccinated Canadian truckers must be tested for COVID-19 and quarantine for two weeks. As Abigail Bimman reports, the changes are likely to impact the supply chain and Canadians\u2019 grocery bills. \n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has said incentives and strong COVID-19 measures have worked to slow the virus\u2019 spread. But, there are lingering questions about whether Ottawa should support provinces, like Quebec, which has introduced a health tax on the unvaccinated. Mercedes Stephenson speaks with Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos about where the federal government stands on the issue.\n\nA monster storm is sweeping across the U.S. this weekend, dumping snow in several states and bringing the threat of a major ice event to several to parts of the south. The winter blast could put New England in a deep freeze and bring possible flooding to New York. Jennifer Johnson reports. \n\nFormer NDP Leader Alexa McDonough has died at the age of 77, following a lengthy battle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As Eric Sorensen reports, she is being remembered as a strong leader, a political pioneer and a stalwart supporter of women\u2019s rights in Canada. \n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of social media influencers, but what about \u201cfinfluencers?\u201d They talk money on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter, but it can be hard to know whom to trust. In part two of our Influenced series, Anne Gaviola takes a closer look at how to treat financial advice on social media.\n\nThe start of the Beijing 2022 Olympics is just over two weeks away and organizers are confident everything will be ready on time. Instead, there is concern about the spread of the highly-contagious Omicron variant. As Mike Drolet reports, China is going to extreme lengths to keep COVID-19 from spoiling the games.\n\nFor more info, please go to ",
