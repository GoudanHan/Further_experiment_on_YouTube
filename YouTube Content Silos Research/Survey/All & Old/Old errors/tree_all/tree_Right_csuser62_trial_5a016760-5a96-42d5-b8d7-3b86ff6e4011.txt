Bike manufacturers are also working on the transition in the motorcycle segment.\n\nWhile this change has been taking place, trucking has been continuing unchanged in the background. Our food, household goods, and even electric car parts, have been transported by diesel power just like they have been from the start, while the industry has grown to be worth $700 billion in the US alone, more than many of the world\u2019s countries\u2019 GDPs.\n\nWith the huge weights involved, electrifying the trucking industry has taken a back seat due to the impracticality, but at the end of 2017, 3 years ago, Tesla announced plans to change this with the Semi, a fully electric truck designed to shake up the shipping industry.\n\nWhy The Tesla Semi Is The Future of Trucks",

Most lawyers do.  It is just a great movie that involves great lawyering.  Everyone should watch this movie.  But the question is: Is Vinny Gambini a good lawyer?  We'll find out today.\n\nThe movies starts with two students driving through the South on their way to California. Once they arrive in Alabama, they stop at a local convenience store to pick up a few snacks. The store clerk is murdered just after they leave and, in a case of mistaken identity, they are fingered for the crime.  Facing execution, the students do not have enough money for a lawyer, so they hire their cousin, Vincent Laguardia Gambini (Joe Pesci). After failing the bar 5 times, Vinny has been a lawyer for about six weeks and has to learn the process on the job.  Vinny has to defend his clients and battle an uncompromising judge, some tough locals, and even his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei).   \n\n(Thanks to Indochino for sponsoring this video and helping to make this channel possible)\n\nNew episodes weekly!

Public choice theory explores why government fails through how voters, politicians, and bureaucrats actually make decisions. Professor Antony Davies explains.\n\nPublic choice economics is a field in economics in which we take what we understand about how humans behave, which is normally applied to humans in the private sector, and we apply this knowledge to humans in the public sector. What emerges is an interesting dichotomy between how we imagine government works and how it actually works.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\nFor a full transcript please visit:  ",

If the poorest workers can simply make more money per hour, they\u2019ll be lifted out of poverty, right?\n\nBut would supporters change their minds if drastic wage hikes resulted in some nasty unintended consequences, both for the poor and for others?\n\nCalifornia's governor Jerry Brown signed a bill raising the state's wage to $15 an hour, despite admitting that, from an economic standpoint, such a hike \"may not make sense.\"  Fifteen dollars an hour is a wage that Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have each advocated for as a federal minimum, even though a CBO report estimated that even President Obama's more modest proposed hike to $10.10 an hour would result in about 500,000 American jobs lost.   \n\nReason TV visited Los Angeles' hipster enclave of Silver Lake to find out how high residents would like to see the minimum wage go and to discuss some of the possible outcomes of a wage hike on the local economy.\n\nVisit ",

            "description": "The faculty council at Occidental College is considering instituting a system for students to report microaggressions perpetrated against them by faculty members or other students.\n\nReason TV visited Occidental's campus to find out what exactly constitutes a microaggression. One Columbia psychology professor defined the term this way:\n\n    Microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.\n\nAfter exploring the limitations of a microaggression reporting system, we discussed broader free speech issues with the students in the wake of a month of campus protests that resulted in the resignations of several faculty members and a university president. \n\nMost of the students defended free speech in principle, if not always in practice. This is consistent with a recent Pew Research Center survey, which found that although 95 percent of Americans agree that people should be allowed to publicly criticize government policies, support erodes when the question turns to offensive speech. While a majority of millennials still believe that the government should protect speech offensive to minorities, a whopping 40 percent believe the government should restric such speech.\n\n\"If you say 'You're less of a person because you're Muslim/Jewish/Christian/Catholic... that's not okay. That's a hate crime,\" one student told us.\n\nAnother student argued that the government should curtail the speech of Donald Trump, while a protest organizer told us that free speech is a rhetorical device used by the priveleged against the oppressed.\n\nVisit ",
