The experience taught him to rely on his own sense of curiosity and importance when deciding what questions and interests are worth studying. As a result, he has pursued many different paths of research in avian biology\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as behavioral evolution, where feathers come from, sexual selection and mate choice\u200a\u2014\u200amany of which have led to deep implications in the field. In 2017, Tyler agreed with several prominent outlets that Prum\u2019s book The Evolution of Beauty was one of the best books of the year, writing that it \u201coffers an excellent and clearly written treatment of the particulars of avian evolution, signaling theory, and aesthetics, bringing together some disparate areas very effectively.\u201d\n\nRichard joined Tyler to discuss the infidelity of Australian birds, the debate on the origins of avian flight, how the lack of a penis explains why birds are so beautiful, why albatrosses can afford to take so many years to develop before mating, the game theory of ornithology, how flowers advertise themselves like a can of Coke, how modern technology is revolutionizing bird watching, why he\u2019s pro-bird feeders yet anti- outdoor cats, how scarcity predicts territoriality in birds, his favorite bird artist, how Oilbirds got their name, how falcons and cormorants hunt and fish with humans, whether birds exhibit a G factor, why birds have regional accents, whether puffins will perish, why he\u2019s not excited about the idea of trying to bring back passenger pigeons, the \u201cdumb question\u201d that marks a talented perspective ornithologist, and more.\n\nTranscript and links: ",

The result is some wildly unpopular opinions such as \u201cThe British Empire was good, actually\u201d and several wildly popular books, such as his latest Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe.\n\nNiall joined Tyler to discuss the difference between English and Scottish pessimism, his surprise encounter with Sean Connery, what James Bond and Doctor Who have in common, how religion fosters the cultural imagination to produce doomsday scenarios, which side of the Glorious Revolution he would have been on, the extraordinary historical trajectory of Scotland from the 17th century through the 18th century, why historians seem to have an excessive occupation with leadership, what he learned from R.G. Collingwood and A.J.P. Taylor, why American bands could never quite get punk music right, Tocqueville\u2019s insights on liberalism, the unfortunate iconoclasm of John Maynard Keynes, the dystopian novel he finds most plausible, what he learned about right and left populism on his latest trip to Latin America, the importance of intellectual succession and building institutions, what he\u2019ll do next, and more.\n\nTranscript and links: ",

It\u2019s a bracing conversation with a scholar who has an incredible breadth of interests and knowledge.\n\nFor further information: ",
