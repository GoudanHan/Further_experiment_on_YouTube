Dave shares video of Kamala Harris, Dr. Fauci, and Joe Biden all being skeptical of the vaccine when it was under the Trump administration. Dave also questions why there is a vaccine mandate exemption for members of congress and their staff.\n\nWatch Dave's FULL DIRECT MESSAGE here:",

It\u2019s all a Twitter media hallucination. And I\u2019m genuinely wondering, and I have some Democratic colleagues who behind closed doors are wondering where this is coming from and whether the president is actually getting access to the full scope of the facts and whether he\u2019s purposely being kept in the dark.  \n\n...",
