I have been warning everyone since last year about what these \"fact-checkers\" represent, and we are inching ever-closer to a totalitarian state. I began suing the fact-checkers last year because I knew that their actions would culminate into this extraordinary moment in American history: a sitting President of the United States has been censored. This means none of us are safe from being wiped away. My Facebook page has long since been demonetized but I believe we can make this video viral by sharing person to person. I still believe in the power of the people.",
