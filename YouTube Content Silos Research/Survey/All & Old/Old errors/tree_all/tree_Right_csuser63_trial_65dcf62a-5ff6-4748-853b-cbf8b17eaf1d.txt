We explore topics like niche-switching, what Darwin got wrong, Twitter, sources for modern values, hyper-novelty, the aftermath of progress, parenthood, and sexual selection \u2013 just to name a few.\nBret Weinstein and Heather Heying are evolutionary biologists, former Evergreen State College professors, and the current hosts of the DarkHorse podcast. You may also know Bret through Joe Rogan, or as the twice-moderator for Jordan\u2019s debates with Sam Harris. \nThe couple\u2019s book, titled \u201cA Hunter-Gatherer\u2019s Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life,\u201d asks why the most prosperous age in history has scarcely offset suicide rates, tribal division, loneliness, and human misery.\n\nFollow Bret at: ",

(In reality, it\u2019s much more.) But luckily, Myth 10 is that there\u2019s no way to fix this problem\u2026 \n\nMyth number one, the government owes $20 trillion. How much is $20 trillion? Suppose you go to Germany, and in Germany, you go to every town. In every town, you visit every store. In every store, you look at every shelf and grab everything that is for sale. The amount of money you spend will not be $20 trillion. If you go to Germany and then to France and you go to every town, and within every town, you go to every store. In every store, you look on every shelf and you buy everything. You still will not have spent $20 trillion. You can go to England and while you\u2019re there, you can go to the North Countries and buy everything that\u2019s for sale, and you still will not have spent $20 trillion. In fact, to spend $20 trillion, you have to go to every country in Europe, visit every town, in every town, go to every store. In every store, look on every shelf and buy everything. And then you will have spent about $20 trillion.\n\nBut the myth is that this is how much money the government owes. It turns out that there\u2019s more, called unfunded obligations. Unfunded obligations is money the Federal Government has promised but which it does not and will not have the money to pay. Largely, this consists of promises of retirement and medical benefits. If you would take the present value of all the future promises of retirement and medical benefits the government has made and subtract from that the amount of money that\u2019s in the government\u2019s Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and then subtract from that the amount of money the Federal Government anticipates collecting under the current law from future Social Security and Medicare taxes, you will still have an amount of money left over that the government does not have.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: ",

Inflation occurs when the quantity of money increases faster than the quantity of goods. Why does the money supply increase? Very often, it does so to enable the government to pay its bills without raising taxes. There's only one real cure for inflation. It is a cure that's easy to describe but difficult to apply: The government must reduce spending and print less money. The alternatives are both recession and double-digit inflation.

I have been warning everyone since last year about what these \"fact-checkers\" represent, and we are inching ever-closer to a totalitarian state. I began suing the fact-checkers last year because I knew that their actions would culminate into this extraordinary moment in American history: a sitting President of the United States has been censored. This means none of us are safe from being wiped away. My Facebook page has long since been demonetized but I believe we can make this video viral by sharing person to person. I still believe in the power of the people.",
