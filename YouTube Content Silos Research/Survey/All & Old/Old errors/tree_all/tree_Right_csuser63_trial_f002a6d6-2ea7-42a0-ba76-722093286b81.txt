Applying the problem-solving skills he honed as a surgeon, he takes on tough issues such as education, health care, family values, race relations, taxes, charity, and the role of faith in public life.\n\nAvoiding the political correctness of politicians and the animosity of Washington lawyers, Dr. Carson In his journey from poverty to the top of his field, Dr. Carson has lived the American dream. He shows how we can save that dream for our future generations, by restoring a moral, informed citizenry that will support \u201cone nation, under God, indivisible.\u201d\n\nTo purchase a hardcover copy of Dr. Ben Carson's book \"One Nation:  What We Can All Do to Save America\u2019s Future\"  (available with a Reagan Library bookplate autographed by Dr. Carson following his appearance)  visit ",
