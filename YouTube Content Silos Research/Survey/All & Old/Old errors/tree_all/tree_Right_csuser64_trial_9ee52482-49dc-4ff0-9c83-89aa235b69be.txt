Joe Biden is getting enormous amounts of backlash for his COVID vaccine mandate. While the Biden administration is resorting to force to deal with vaccine hesitancy to fight the Delta variant it was not long ago he was questioning the COVID 19 vaccine. Dave shares video of Kamala Harris, Dr. Fauci, and Joe Biden all being skeptical of the vaccine when it was under the Trump administration. Dave also questions why there is a vaccine mandate exemption for members of congress and their staff.\n\nWatch Dave's FULL DIRECT MESSAGE here:",
