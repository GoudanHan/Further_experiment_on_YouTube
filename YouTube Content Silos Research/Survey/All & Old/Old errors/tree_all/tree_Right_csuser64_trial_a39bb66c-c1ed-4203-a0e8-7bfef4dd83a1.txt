Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, assesses the causes of the present Ukraine crisis, the best way to end it, and its consequences for all of the main actors. A key assumption is that in order to come up with the optimum plan for ending the crisis, it is essential to know what caused the crisis. Regarding the all-important question of causes, the key issue is whether Russia or the West bears primary responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: ",

                    "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018\n\nThomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.\n\nSowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.\n\nSowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).\n\nRobinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.\n\nInterested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

That show was one of our most-watched interviews of 2019, so we thought it was time to sit down with Douglas again and get an update on where things stand with regard to, as Douglas describes in his book, \u201cthe interpretation of the world through the lens of \u2018social justice,\u2019 \u2018identity group politics\u2019 and \u2018intersectionalism\u2019 . . . the most audacious and comprehensive effort since the end of the Cold War at creating a new ideology.\u201d We also discuss European politics, examine Boris Johnson\u2019s tenure as UK prime minister, and take a sobering look at American politics from the perspective of a very sharp observer. \n\nFor further information: ",
