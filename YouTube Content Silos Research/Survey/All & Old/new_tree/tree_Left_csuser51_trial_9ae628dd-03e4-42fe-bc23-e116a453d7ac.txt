It was supposed to only be 12 minutes long, but I got lost in the research and the scope and size of this topic, so I ended up making an almost one-hour long video. And still... I think this video doesn't contain enough information.\nThe Topic is India and Pakistan, their conflicts for independence and the historical background of such. As well as the conflicts that resulted out of independence. An overview of the Indian republic and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. As well as a brief intermission on Bangladesh and the geopolitics surrounding Sri Lanka. I hope you enjoyed the video. Don't forget to support the channel. And as said in the video, here is a bibliography:\n\nHermann Kulke - A History of India, 1998\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Landy - Dictionnaire de l'Inde contemporaine, 2010 (many thanks to the French subscriber who provided translations and information)\n\nLaurent Gayer - Karachi: Ordered Disorder and the Struggle for the City, 2014\n\nLaurent Gayer - Armed Militias of South Asia: Fundamentalists, Maoists and Separatists, 2008\n\n\n\u25baYou can support my channel on Patreon here: ",
