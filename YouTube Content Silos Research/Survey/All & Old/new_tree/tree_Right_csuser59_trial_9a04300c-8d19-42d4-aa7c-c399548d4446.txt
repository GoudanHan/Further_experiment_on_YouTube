For her part, Spain midfielder Putellas, who had made The Best FIFA Women\u2019s Player shortlist for the first time, capped her exploits with FC Barcelona and the Spanish national team by winning the prestigious award.  \n\nChelsea FC Women manager Emma Hayes was voted The Best FIFA Women\u2019s Coach for the first time in her career, a feat that was matched by her Chelsea FC counterpart, Thomas Tuchel, who topped the poll for The Best FIFA Men\u2019s Coach. \n\nSenegal shot-stopper \u00c9douard Mendy made it a hat-trick for the London club by being chosen as The Best FIFA Men\u2019s Goalkeeper, becoming the first African to win the accolade, while Chile and Olympique Lyonnais\u2019 Christiane Endler was named The Best FIFA Women\u2019s Goalkeeper on the strength of her sensational displays.\n\nThe Best FIFA Football Awards ceremony also recognised two outstanding performances on the international stage, where landmark goalscoring records have been broken. Christine Sinclair, with 188 goals in 308 caps for Canada, received The Best FIFA Special Award for women\u2019s football, and Cristiano Ronaldo, with 115 goals in 184 appearances for Portugal, received The Best FIFA Special Award for men\u2019s football. \n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino presented the awards to Christine Sinclair (virtual) and Cristiano Ronaldo (in person) during The Best FIFA Football Awards 2021 ceremony at the Home of FIFA in Zurich.\n\nMore on ",

        "description": "A tsunami which hit Tonga has left island communications crippled, with people overseas anxiously waiting for news of loved ones.\n\nThe underwater volcano erupted on Saturday, about 65km (40 miles) north of the capital Nuku'alofa.\n\nThe eruption, which was heard as far away as the US, caused waves higher than a metre to crash into Tonga.\n\nThe authorities have not confirmed any deaths but the scale of the destruction is difficult to establish with phone and internet communications damaged.\n\nBut the Red Cross gave some cause for hope, saying reports suggested the damage was not as bad as had been feared.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE ",
