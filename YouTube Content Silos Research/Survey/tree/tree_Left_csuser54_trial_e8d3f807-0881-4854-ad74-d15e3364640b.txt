                    "description": "The Big Apple is in bad shape.  \n \nIt\u2019s the epicentre of the US fight against the corona virus outbreak. Its people are in lockdown while frontline services wage war against the pandemic. \n \nWith over fourteen thousand dead, New York City accounts for around one third of all corona-related deaths in the US.  \n \nEvery day, there are hundreds of new infections and deaths. The city\u2019s hospitals are overflowing, health workers lack medical and protective equipment and morgues have run out of space. \n \nForeign Correspondent\u2019s reporter Karishma Vyas, a New York resident, goes behind the lines of the city\u2019s battle to slow infections, save lives, protect its vulnerable and bury the dead. \n \nWe follow paramedics as they respond to emergency house calls, helping desperate families. We discover many who die of COVID-19 don\u2019t make the official death toll.   \n \nWe film with the police union as they hand out desperately needed personal safety equipment to their officers. \n \n\u201cI thought I\u2019d seen it all on September 11th, but I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. We\u2019re anticipating this getting even worse. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to get this equipment out to our guys\u201d, says a Union officer.  \n \nWe speak with an ICU nurse who\u2019s travelled from out of state to lend a hand in a Bronx hospital. He tells us about working double shifts, often with no break, and the pressure of looking after multiple critically ill patients at the same time. A good day is when none of his patients die. \n \nOne overworked doctor describes his frustration with the US health system. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve had people come in barely breathing and their first question isn\u2019t \u2018Am I going to survive?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018How is this going to impact my family financially?\u2019\u201d \n \n\u201cThis illness exposes all the fault-lines throughout American society\u201d, says the doctor. \n \nAnd we catch up with characters who embody the city\u2019s spirit of defiance and survival. \n \n\u201cI want to be remembered as someone who never left the frontlines and who was essential\u201d, says the Naked Cowboy, a performer whose stage is Times Square \u2013 rain, hail or coronavirus.  \n \nThis is an intimate and powerful portrait of a city in crisis.  \n\n\nAbout Foreign Correspondent: \nForeign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

Two I.C.U. nurses wore cameras to show what it\u2019s like to care for the sickest Covid patients a year into the pandemic.\n\nSo many Americans have died in hospitals without family by their side, but they were not alone. Nurses brush patients\u2019 teeth, change their catheters and hold their hands in their final moments.\n\nIn just a year, we\u2019ve lost half a million Americans to Covid-19. Vaccinations may be offering some relief, but inside I.C.U.s, nurses continue to contend with the trauma and grief of America\u2019s carousel of death.\n\nSubscribe: ",

            "description": "In the video above, Alexander Stockton, a producer on the Opinion Video team, explores two of the main reasons the number of Covid cases is soaring once again in the United States: vaccine hesitancy and refusal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to watch the pandemic drag on as Americans refuse the vaccine in the name of freedom,\u201d he says.\n\nSeeking understanding, Mr. Stockton travels to Mountain Home, Ark., in the Ozarks, a region with galloping contagion and \u2014 not unrelated \u2014 abysmal vaccination rates.\n\nHe finds that a range of feelings and beliefs underpins the low rates \u2014 including fear, skepticism and a libertarian strain of defiance.\n\nThis doubt even extends to the staff at a regional hospital, where about half of the medical personnel are not vaccinated \u2014 even while the intensive care unit is crowded with unvaccinated Covid patients fighting for their lives.\n\nMountain Home \u2014 like the United States as a whole \u2014 is caught in a tug of war between private liberty and public health. But Mr. Stockton suggests that unless government upholds its duty to protect Americans, keeping the common good in mind, this may be a battle with no end.\n\n\nSubscribe: ",

And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space.
