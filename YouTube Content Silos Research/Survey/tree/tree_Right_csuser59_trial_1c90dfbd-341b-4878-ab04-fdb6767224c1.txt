Joe Biden is getting enormous amounts of backlash for his COVID vaccine mandate. While the Biden administration is resorting to force to deal with vaccine hesitancy to fight the Delta variant it was not long ago he was questioning the COVID 19 vaccine. Dave shares video of Kamala Harris, Dr. Fauci, and Joe Biden all being skeptical of the vaccine when it was under the Trump administration. Dave also questions why there is a vaccine mandate exemption for members of congress and their staff.\n\nWatch Dave's FULL DIRECT MESSAGE here:",

                    "description": "This Rear Wing is absolutely MENTAL! It's called the 'Active Multi-Axis Centripetal Wing' - let me explain.\n\nSo when you look at a Ferrari, then a Ferrari race car - there aren\u2019t that many differences anymore. Power is similar, suspension setups are similar, and so are the brakes. \n\nBut the main one is the aero - but! Properly clever active aerodynamics have slowly been appearing on modern supercars - and this Zenvo is the maddest of them all.\n\u2014\nEnzo Ferrari once said \u201caerodynamics are for people who can\u2019t build engines\u201d. In hindsight, he might be wrong. Aerodynamics has shaped the way cars look, made them faster and even more economical.\n\nAs technology has moved on, carmakers have tried many clever ways to improve aerodynamics. One of the most popular, particularly in modern supercars, is active aero. This enables a car's aerodynamics to change while it's moving.\n\nAnd by the way, folding the mirrors in on your Fiesta doesn\u2019t count.\n\nTo give you an example, a fixed rear wing can give you an improvement in downforce, pushing down on the rear wheels and increasing grip. Unfortunately, it also increases drag, making it harder for a car to move through the air at higher speeds - reducing its top speed.\n\nSo the engineers need to figure out something that can change dynamically. \n\nThe McLaren P1 is a great example of this. Not only can it hunker down closer to the ground, but the rear wing changes in height and angle depending on the speed or mode it's in. \n\n\n\u2b55 Why Rotary Engines Kinda Suck",
