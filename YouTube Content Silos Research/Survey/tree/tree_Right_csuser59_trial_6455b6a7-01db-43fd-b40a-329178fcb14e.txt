There are obviously a lot of factors that go into this question: your age at retirement, your lifestyle, your pension, your OAS amount, and of course a lot more. \n\nWhile the question is important, it can often leave Canadians stressed which is exactly the opposite what you want in retirement! This is where a financial plan can be extremely important. Everyone's situation is a bit different, so a plan designed for your situation will alleviate any stresses that you may have...plus, you may find that the savings number in your mind may be far higher than what it actually needs to be.\n\n6 ways to level up your financial plan:\nPersonal Finance for Canadians for Dummies: ",

But there have never been recommended limits for sugar on Canadian food labels, despite emerging research that suggests the sweet stuff may be making more of us fat and sick. In the fifth estate\u2019s season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science \u2014 and the reaction from the food industry \u2014 to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?\n\nA small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nWe put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists \u2013 and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.\n\nOriginal airdate : October 4th, 2013\n\nFor more on the fifth estate : ",
