There's something strange in the neighbourhood and so they start a private firm, \"Ghostbusters.\" They hire a colleague, Winston Zeddemore, played by Ernie Hudson and then they save the world!\n\nGhostbusters Afterlife is released November 21st 2021.",

I made this short meme to represent the situation that most of the gamers will have to go thorugh, that is if they find a GPU in stock at their local PC Store.
