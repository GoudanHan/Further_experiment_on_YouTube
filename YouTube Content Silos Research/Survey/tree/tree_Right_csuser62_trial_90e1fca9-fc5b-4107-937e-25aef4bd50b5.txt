I have been warning everyone since last year about what these \"fact-checkers\" represent, and we are inching ever-closer to a totalitarian state. I began suing the fact-checkers last year because I knew that their actions would culminate into this extraordinary moment in American history: a sitting President of the United States has been censored. This means none of us are safe from being wiped away. My Facebook page has long since been demonetized but I believe we can make this video viral by sharing person to person. I still believe in the power of the people.",

                    "description": "September 8, 2021\n\nThis video features the very timely presentation by Dr. Victor Davis Hanson at Hillsdale College, in Hillsdale, MI, on topics from his bestselling book, \"The Dying Citizen: How Progressive Elites, Tribalism, and Globalization Are Destroying the Idea of America.\" He is introduced by Dr. Mark A. Kalthoff, the Henry Salvatori Chair in History and Traditional Values and Dean of Faculty at Hillsdale College (www.hillsdale.edu).\n\n\u201cMr. Hanson, an accomplished classicist and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, is one of the great amalgamators of American political writing. He has a particular gift for bringing together a dizzying array of events, controversies and ideas and making sense of them by advancing a coherent argument that incorporates thousands of years of history\u2026 Mr. Hanson hits hard, but I don\u2019t find his analysis unfair or partisan. There is enormous value, moreover, in thinking about toxic political developments not as problems of the moment but as destructive pathologies to which all societies are prone at all times.\u201d\n\u2014\"Wall Street Journal\"\n\n\u201cIndispensable\u2026 Hanson\u2019s immensely erudite and inspiriting book offers a most welcome corrective to those influential forces and doctrines in our midst that conspire to delegitimize the citizen and citizenship as such. In doing so, he provides us with hope that our society still has within it significant powers of rejuvenation.\u201d\n\u2014\"National Review\"\n\n\u201cAs Victor Davis Hanson shows in his learned, powerful, and troubling new book, 'The Dying Citizen,' the steady devolution of citizenship speaks volumes about where we are today and where we seem to be heading\u2026 Hanson lays out this grim diagnosis with his usual clarity and brilliance, moving easily from his deep specialized knowledge of the ancient Greek and Roman world through savvy observations about present-day politics and American society.\u201d\n\u2014\"The New Criterion\"\n\n\u201cCitizenship brings all the enduring principles of democracy into the sphere of the individual.  It honors the human need for a collective identity even as it makes room for the individual to pursue happiness. In this remarkably illuminating book, Victor Davis Hanson shows how so many contemporary problems\u2014identity politics, the border crisis, bloated government, etc.\u2014have only worsened for the lack of a vigorous and clarifying idea of citizenship. In this deeply democratic idea, Hanson points to a way beyond what ails us.\u201d\n\u2014Shelby Steele, author of \"Shame\"\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER:\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is the Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow in the Hoover Institution, the Wayne and Marcia Buske Distinguished Fellow in History at Hillsdale College, and a Member of the Board of Advisors for both the Independent Institute as well as the quarterly journal, \"The Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy.\" He received his Ph.D. in classics from Stanford University. The author or editor of twenty-four books, he is the recipient of the American Philological Association's Excellence in Teaching Award, Eric Breindel Award for Excellence in Opinion Journalism, National Humanities Medal and the Bradley Prize.",
