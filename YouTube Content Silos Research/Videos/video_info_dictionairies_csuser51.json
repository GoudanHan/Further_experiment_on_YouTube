Most students will be back to online education, but in western Canada, schools will be open for in-person learning once again. Most doctors agree opening schools should be a priority for kids, but keeping those classrooms open may be more challenging. Heather Yourex-West reports. \n \nA remote COVID-stricken First Nation in northwestern Ontario is getting some military help, but not as much help as it asked for. Bearskin Lake First Nation is about 600 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. More than half of the community\u2019s 400 residents have tested positive and nearly the entire community is in self-isolation. David Akin has more.\n \nQuebec is reporting a sharp jump in COVID-19 hospitalizations today, climbing by 140 since yesterday. The situation outside Montreal is especially dire, forcing some regions to make tough decisions. \n \nKazakhstan\u2019s health ministry says 164 people were killed during a week of deadly protests that began over a sharp rise in fuel prices. Kazakhstan will be a key sticking point during top level talks between the U.S. and Russia that begin tomorrow. But the biggest will be Russia\u2019s potential threat against Ukraine and how Russian President Vladimir Putin is amassing troops along the border. Jennifer Johnson joins us with the latest.\n \nConservationists are praising the federal government for helping to save endangered sharks. At a recent international meeting, Canada successfully lobbied for the protection of Shortfin mako sharks. It can be found worldwide including off the coast of Nova Scotia and even into the Gulf of the St. Lawrence. As Ross Lord explains, mako numbers are declining leading to fears they could soon be extinct. \n \nThe effects of man-made climate change is expected to be felt most severely in the developing world in the coming decades. Droughts in Africa are already impacting a giant project that itself is trying to hold back the effects of Mother Nature. The so-called Great Green Wall Initiative involves re-planting billions of hectares across the width of the continent. But as Redmond Shannon reports, the long-term consequences of the plan are still unknown.\n \nA big wallop of winter isn\u2019t exactly the norm for Vancouver Island so when it does happen it can be difficult to deal with. In one seaside town a group of Good Samaritans put their shovels, musical talents and a borrowed B.C. transit bus to work to clear out all the recent snow.

(CUTEST DOG EVER)", "content creator": "Life with Malamutes", "description": "We told you that time was coming again!! Phil never learns as he gleefully wallows in mud galore! He's so happy until he's home and has to turn left at the top of the stairs, the realisation hits! The despair is real! The dog lives for peanut butter but he pretends its not there in a desperate bid to vanish. Phil mimics a statue as he stares into the wall trying to remain hidden! He is hilarious in his characteristics I'm sure you'll agree...\n\nSo things took a different turn this time. Harley (Phil's favourite person) offered to wash Phil to see if the situation could be more pleasing for him. First off she tried reasoning but it wasn't working. She tried to take a more forceful approach but Phil was adamant it wasn't happening! \n\nHe is such a big baby all the drama before to then get in and be fine, sometimes he remembers when he is in the bath and starts to act again but generally once the ordeal of getting in is over he is pretty much fine! \n\nIf this is the first time you've seen Phil take a bath and long for more of this, don't worry we got you covered! There are a few Phil bath saga's in our library just search 'sulking dog'\n\nMilo has also suffered the wrath of the bath, only once though haha he was quite chill actually!\n\nNiko doesn't min the bath and in the last video she even got in to show off!\n\nPhil starts throwing a tantrum and Niko gets wind of this so the two start howling mid video - it's quite loud in a bathroom haha. \n\nOf course Mia was there for support once again, she even tries to help wash her teddy bear at one point, she doesn't want to see him upset!\n\nBut the golden moments are Harley's failures. You can't not laugh along with this one. Phil is so heavy and when he doesn't want to move its nearly impossible, couple that with his sad crying and frantic pivot turning it's so funny!\n\nThanks for watching guys. See you next time.

The exhausted climbers were soon lost in a fierce blizzard and far from the safety of Camp 4 at 26,000 feeet. Renowned Climber/filmmaker David Breasheers, who was on the mountain that fateful day, returns to Everest to tell the complete story of what really happened on that legendary climb.\n\n\n------1996 Mt Everest Disaster-------\nThe 1996 Mount Everest disaster occurred on 10\u201311 May 1996, when eight climbers caught in a blizzard died on Mount Everest while attempting to descend from the summit. Over the entire season, 12 people died trying to reach the summit, making it the deadliest season on Mount Everest at the time and the third deadliest after the 16 fatalities of the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche and the 22 resulting from avalanches caused by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. The 1996 disaster received widespread publicity and raised questions about the commercialization of Everest.\n\nNumerous climbers were at a high altitude on Everest during the storm, including the Adventure Consultants team, led by Rob Hall, and the Mountain Madness team, led by Scott Fischer. While climbers died on both the North Face and South Col approaches, the events on the South Face were more widely reported. Four members of the Adventure Consultants expedition perished, including Hall, while Fischer was the sole casualty of the Mountain Madness expedition. Three officers of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police also died.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Frontline\ncir: 2008\nDirector: David Breashears", "date": "Apr 2, 2021", "views": "2,081,228 views", "comments": "2,916", "likes": "22,132 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6064.341, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So3vH9FY2H4", "id": "So3vH9FY2H4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0WCh_Q3L7I": {"title": "Happy Morning Jazz - Positive Mood Winter Jazz and Bossa Nova Music to Relax", "content creator": "Relax Cafe Music", "description": "The Best Live Stream of 24/7 Morning Jazz Radio Music!

Soultana Kotrides, 16, and Jory Knauf, 15, became best friends growing up as neighbors in Rochester, New York, from 2006 until 2016, when Soultana's family moved to Fort Mill, South Carolina. Despite the distance between them, Soultana would still make an annual visit back to Rochester to visit Jory and his family. But this year, because of the precautions with COVID-19, that trip was canceled, adding to the disappointments Soultana was already facing during her senior year of high school. Knowing how sad this had made his best friend, Jory and the families started working on a plan to pay a surprise visit to South Carolina. Jory's mother, Lynn, purchased a deliveryman outfit from Amazon, and Soultana was told that her Greek grandmother had mailed her a package that she would like a video of her opening. As Jory and Lynn drove to South Carolina, they were frequently texting Soultana's dad John with updates. Ahead of the visit, all family members were also tested for COVID-19, John said, so that they knew the travel arrangements would not be spreading the virus. Then, when it was time for \u2018grandma\u2019s package\u2019 to arrive, the Kotrides family began filming Soultana as she went to collect it.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 Read the full story here: ", "date": "Sep 14, 2020", "views": "41,080,427 views", "comments": "3,747", "likes": "715,609 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 60.361, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5lENnRGei8", "id": "_5lENnRGei8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7lObaDiBk": {"title": "Obama forgets to salute", "content creator": "CNN", "description": "President Obama forgot to salute when he boarded Marine One.

Terri stated that she left the school at around 8:45 a.m. and that she last remembered seeing Kyron walking down the hall to his first class. However, he was never seen in his first class and was instead marked as absent that day.\n\nAdventures With Purpose steps in on this case remembering that 1.5 years earlier they pulled a Red Wagon from a nearby boat ramp on Sauvie's Island. \n\nDID IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH KYRON'S DISAPPEARANCE? \n\nIn late June 2010, in the midst of the investigation into Kyron's disappearance, Kaine Horman was reportedly told by investigators that Terri had offered their landscaper, Rodolfo Sanchez, \"a lot of money\" to kill her husband. Sanchez testified in a deposition that Terri approached him to help kill her husband in January 2010, five months before Kyron's disappearance.\n\nTerri failed two separate polygraph examinations regarding Kyron's disappearance.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, Kyron's mother, Desiree Young, filed a civil lawsuit against Terri claiming that she was \"responsible for the disappearance of Kyron.\n\nThe lawsuit attempted to prove that Terri had kidnapped Kyron on the day he disappeared. \n\nYoung sought $10 million in damages from Horman.\n\nIn early October 2012, Spicher refused to answer any of the 142 questions posed to her during a deposition regarding Young's lawsuit. Among these questions were ones regarding Spicher's whereabouts on June 4, 2010, and her contact with Terri that day. She also declined to identify a photo of Kyron, whether she had met him before or not, and whether she knew his father, Kaine.\n\nDuring testimony provided by Kaine Horman in a separate hearing the same year, he stated that police had told him they \"have more probable cause to think Terri Horman was involved in Kyron's disappearance than they did two years ago.\"\n\nOn July 30, 2013, it was announced that Young had dropped the lawsuit against Terri so as not to interfere with the ongoing police investigation.\n\nLocal and state police, along with the FBI, conducted an exhaustive search for Horman and launched a criminal investigation but have not uncovered any significant information regarding the child's whereabouts. His disappearance sparked the largest criminal investigation in Oregon history.\n=============\n\nHug the ones you love and reach out to those in need. \n\nWe are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help Kyron's family in the search for answers as to where Kyron might be.\n\nThe AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones...

India is actually one of the world\u2019s most linguistically diverse countries \u2013 in addition to Hindi and English, hundreds of other languages are spoken, including, in a small corner of northern India, the Punjabi language. The Punjabi people live spread across both India and Pakistan and have a rich and beautiful culture with incredible food, music, and religion. And here in New York City if you head to Punjab Avenue in Queens you\u2019ll find a small but thriving community of Punjabis, particularly Punjabi Sikhs but also Hindus, Muslims, and Christians as well. So this week I brushed up on my Punjabi and headed out there to chat with the locals, who are wonderfully encouraging when it comes to learning their language.
