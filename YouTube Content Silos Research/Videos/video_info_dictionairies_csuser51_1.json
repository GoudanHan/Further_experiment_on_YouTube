A few days ago the rogue state reminded the world how troublesome it is by launching several short-range missiles in the first weapons tests since President Joe Biden took office, sending a sharp message to the new US administration. But behind the aggression, dictator Kim Jong-un is in serious trouble as his regime teeters on bankruptcy. Tom Steinfort, one of the few western journalists to have reported from the hermit kingdom on multiple occasions, says North Korea desperately needs cash and is willing to do almost anything to get it, even selling weapons and drugs on the black market. Now though, these long-suspected crimes have been fully exposed by the unlikely combination of an extraordinary hidden-camera sting and a heartbroken family determined to get justice for their son, who travelled to North Korea for an adventure holiday but ended up imprisoned and tortured to death.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ", "date": "Mar 29, 2021", "views": "7,246,815 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\n#0 0x55ab4f53aa23 <unknown>\n#1 0x55ab4f005e18 <unknown>\n#2 0x55ab4f03c151 <unknown>\n#3 0x55ab4f03c311 <unknown>\n#4 0x55ab4f06eec4 <unknown>\n#5 0x55ab4f0599bd <unknown>\n#6 0x55ab4f06cc5b <unknown>\n#7 0x55ab4f059883 <unknown>\n#8 0x55ab4f02f3fa <unknown>\n#9 0x55ab4f0304c5 <unknown>\n#10 0x55ab4f56a16d <unknown>\n#11 0x55ab4f5805bb <unknown>\n#12 0x55ab4f56be75 <unknown>\n#13 0x55ab4f580e85 <unknown>\n#14 0x55ab4f55f86f <unknown>\n#15 0x55ab4f59bae8 <unknown>\n#16 0x55ab4f59bc68 <unknown>\n#17 0x55ab4f5b6aad <unknown>\n#18 0x7f645da356db <unknown>\n", "likes": "85,523 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1883.101, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J1zAnA2Wds"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JKkudn0F8o": {"title": "Black Rose | Full Action Movie", "content creator": "Mediatime Network", "description": "Black Rose (2014).

It has been responsible for many of American finer moments with its research\nand achievements. With one of the biggest budgets for any agency in the US, NASA is\nequipped to fund many high-power investigations! However, by teaming up with Elon\nMusk, NASA has unlocked many more opportunities! The latest example is the\ndiscovery on planet Neptune! What has Musk and NASA discovered on Neptune, and\nhow does it affect you? Join us to explore Elon Musk and NASA's insane new discovery\non Neptune that changes everything!\nWhat is the longest distance you have ever traveled? If you had moved from one\ncontinent to another, most probably in an aircraft, you could have covered thousands of\nmiles! That is child's play compared with Voyager 2's journey! Moving in the opposite\ndirection to its twin, the Voyager 1, the spacecraft reached planet Neptune in 1989, 12\nyears after it took off from Earth! It was, and still is, on a journey through the solar\nsystem! What it discovered on Neptune was mind blowing! The spacecraft beamed the\nfirst images of the planet's rings, but there was another discovery; a massive and violent\nstorm!\nNASA scientists were not expecting the storm Voyager 2 sent the pictures of! It was\nspotted in the southern hemisphere, appearing as a counter-clockwise wind of up to\n1,500 miles per hour or 2,414 kilometers per hour! It was the strongest ever recorded!\nAstronomers called it the Great Dark Spot. Five years later, it had gone by the time the\nHubble Space Telescope looked at the planet. This led to lots of questions about why\nthe winds were so strong!\nThe strong wind, however, was not the only thing puzzling scientists about Neptune! Its\ntemperature was also a mystery. Voyager 2 revealed that Neptune is warmer than\nUranus, despite being farther from the sun. The conventional wisdom was that the\nfarther you go from the sun in the galaxy, the colder it became! Yet Neptune had more\nheat than Uranus! The question is, where is the heat on Neptune coming from? As\nphysicist Brian Cox discussed in his BBC documentary, The Planets: \"The source of this\nextra heat remains a mystery.\" However, the bigger puzzle was whether the two usual\nbehaviors, that is, the strong wind and the elevated temperature, were in any way tied!\nSome scientists even speculated that unraveling one mystery would explain the other!\nBut how would this be achieved?\nMeasuring Neptune's temperature, however, is not so straightforward! For example, on\nEarth, you can take measurements on the solid surface and calculate the global\naverage. That is not possible on Mars, which is made up of gases. So if you must take a\ntemperature of Neptune, it has to be at an altitude. This is where you need to make\nanother decision; at what altitude will you take the measurement?\nThere is something else about the temperature measurement taken by the Voyager 2!\nObviously, it took the temperature from the outermost layer. At that point, the\ntemperature of Neptune is not so much higher than that of Uranus. But since Neptune\nreceives less solar illumination because it's farther from the sun, this shouldn't be the\ncase.\nWhat this similarity in temperature suggests is that Neptune is warmer in terms of how\nmuch heat it emits in comparison to the amount of heat it absorbs from the sun.\nAccording to Anthony Del Genio of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies,\n\"Voyager's measurements show Neptune emits more than twice as much heat as it\nabsorbs from the sun, while Uranus does not.\"\nThis doesn't make Neptune unusual, though. In fact, it makes Uranus weird because\nother planets like Jupiter and Saturn also emit more heat than they absorb from the sun!\nAs stated earlier, the progression of temperature as you go farther away from the sun\nshows Jupiter to be the warmest of the gas giants, Saturn next, then Neptune. Uranus is\nthe one that is out of place. Del Genio explained the oddity further: \"Yet that unusual\nresult is associated with the fact that Uranus does not have a significant internal heat\nsource.\" In other words, Neptune is finding a way to warm itself up to the level of\nUranus, while the latter is unable to generate any extra heat other than that gleaned\nfrom the sun!\nBut just what is an internal heat source? In simple terms, it is heat left over from the\nbirth of the solar system when these planets were formed. The heat contracts out of the\nprimitive solar nebula, forming an effect known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction.\nThe extra heat source on Neptune, Jupiter, and Saturn is primarily due to gravitational\ncontraction. As the planet slowly gravitationally contracts, the material falling inward\nchanges its potential energy into thermal energy, which is then released upwards out of\nthe planet. For Uranus not to have such a heat source, something must have happened\nto it! So, the question is, why does Neptune produce heat internally, but Uranus does\nnot?", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "2,733,633 views", "comments": "94", "likes": "27,979 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 650.261, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBQ-3nsLhA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKS0kFRjwLI": {"title": "Former enemies playing each other's anthem - part 2", "content creator": "Musicarnia", "description": "00:00  national anthem of France played by UK army band\n00:42  national anthem of Germany played by UK army band\n01:53  national anthem of Soviet Union played by Germany army band", "date": "Jan 9, 2022", "views": "144,668 views", "comments": "512", "likes": "3,609 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 623.181, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKS0kFRjwLI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9FrL6wAuQQ": {"title": "FOX and Friends 1/16/22 | BREAKING FOX NEWS January 16, 2022", "content creator": "Pitbull TV", "description": "FOX and Friends 1/16/22\nTelegram trump : https://t.me/donaltrump2021\nLike and Folow Page \nThank all For watching\u2026!\n\u25b6\u25b6 Watch more Fox News Video:\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 5AM: Fox and Friends\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 9AM: America's Newsroom\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 11AM: The Faulkner Focus\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 12PM: Outnumbered\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 1PM: America Reports\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 3PM: The Story Martha MacCallum\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 4PM: Your World With Neil Cavuto\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 5PM: The Five\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 6PM: Special Report With Bret Baier\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 7PM: Fox News Primetime\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 8PM: Tucker Carlson Tonight\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 9PM: Sean Hannity\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 10PM: The Ingraham Angle\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 11PM: Gutfeld!", "date": "Premiered Jan 16, 2022", "views": "211,253 views", "comments": "766", "likes": "2,451 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5.241, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9FrL6wAuQQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYoHjiqRgsk": {"title": "Kevin Hart Loses It Over Jodie Whittaker\u2019s Poisonous Spider Story | The Graham Norton Show", "content creator": "The Graham Norton Show", "description": "That sounds terrifying!

Alongside the challenge of sleeping in such cold conditions, I also cooked up some tasty meals that are quick and easy to prepare.\n\nThe gear I used:\n\nSleep mat: 1/2\" closed-cell foam sleep pad.\nBlankets: Two queen sized wool blankets.\nClothing: Cotton base layer, wool insulating layer, and waxed cotton pants and jacket outer layer.\nBoots: Sorel Pac Boots\nBackpack: Kelty Redwing 44\nCook Kit: Woods Nootka Cook Set\n\nHow did I not freeze?\nThis was actually one of the warmest camps I've ever had. I didn't get cold once. I layed wood on my fire in a particular way to create a \"wall\" of fire which kept me very warm. It was so warm I had to strip down to my base layer to sleep comfortably.\n\nAn open shelter? Aren't you afraid of animals?\nThe open shelter is very pleasant to sleep in. I do not worry about wildlife. In this area there are grizzly bears, black bears, wolves, and cougars. The bears are sleeping the winter away, so they aren't likely to be a problem. Wolves and cougars in this area are quite timid towards humans and usually won't bother us. Fun fact though, on my hike out from this camp I came across fresh tracks from a pack of wolves about 200 yards away from my camp. It looked like they were just travelling through the area though. Pretty cool to see.\n\nThank you so much to everyone who watches and supports the channel. I hope everyone enjoys.

Never before had a war been fought on so many diverse landscapes and in so many different ways, from rocket attacks in London to jungle fighting in Burma to armor strikes in Libya.\nDrawing on 3,000 years of military history, Victor Davis Hanson argues that despite its novel industrial barbarity, neither the war's origins nor its geography were unusual. Nor was its ultimate outcome surprising. The Axis powers were well prepared to win limited border conflicts, but once they blundered into global war, they had no hope of victory.\n\n05/02/18", "date": "May 7, 2018", "views": "466,819 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\n#0 0x55e9201b8a23 <unknown>\n#1 0x55e91fc83e18 <unknown>\n#2 0x55e91fcba151 <unknown>\n#3 0x55e91fcba311 <unknown>\n#4 0x55e91fcecec4 <unknown>\n#5 0x55e91fcd79bd <unknown>\n#6 0x55e91fceac5b <unknown>\n#7 0x55e91fcd7883 <unknown>\n#8 0x55e91fcad3fa <unknown>\n#9 0x55e91fcae4c5 <unknown>\n#10 0x55e9201e816d <unknown>\n#11 0x55e9201fe5bb <unknown>\n#12 0x55e9201e9e75 <unknown>\n#13 0x55e9201fee85 <unknown>\n#14 0x55e9201dd86f <unknown>\n#15 0x55e920219ae8 <unknown>\n#16 0x55e920219c68 <unknown>\n#17 0x55e920234aad <unknown>\n#18 0x7f87002106db <unknown>\n", "likes": "4,602 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4799.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC94iAUXVPQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0VA-btO43Y": {"title": "sonic screaming for no reason", "content creator": "Sonic Central", "description": "the scream heard from around world.\n#sonic #sonicadventure #sonicthehedgehog", "date": "Nov 2, 2021", "views": "661,564 views", "comments": "869", "likes": "16,888 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0VA-btO43Y"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNH2cQAs57o": {"title": "Oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019obligation vaccinale, une orthophoniste cesse le travail", "content creator": "RT France", "description": "RT France est all\u00e9 \u00e0 la rencontre des Fran\u00e7ais au sujet du pass sanitaire.

Those who did not die of large pulmonary emboli died of extensive inflammation, meaning pneumonia with ARDS. In these COVID Autopsy cases, the lungs were wet and heavy, like a saturated water sponge. The lung surfaces often had a distinct patchy pattern, with pale areas alternating with slightly protruding and firm, deep reddish-blue Hypercapillarized areas. \n\nThis indicates areas of intense inflammation, with endothelial dysfunction that can be seen at the microscopic level. When they looked at the lungs' slices under the microscope, they found diffuse alveolar damage in 8 COVID Autopsy cases. Specifically, they saw hyaline membrane formation, tiny clots in the capillaries, capillaries engorged with red blood cells, and other inflammatory findings. All these findings represent ARDS. They also found lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, infiltrated these areas of infiltration. This fits the picture of viral pathogenesis.\n\n\u23e9 Timestamps", "date": "May 14, 2020", "views": "16,619,412 views", "comments": "17,564", "likes": "235,372 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 822.861, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6h8TIxeg1g"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GEStca5lXc": {"title": "Evel Knievel - \"Absolute Evel\" 2005", "content creator": "My Collection", "description": "A 2005 documentary on Evel's life.

These puppies require very specialized care due to severe brachycephaly (flat faces) which puts them at high risk of aspiration and other respiratory problems. Unfortunately, people continue to intentionally breed brachycephalic dogs for profit, with no regard for the suffering they cause. In addition to having a high risk of lifelong health issues, French bulldogs also have very high maternal and infant mortality; I don\u2019t think most people realize that the consequence of buying these \u201ccute squishy face puppies\u201d is that many mothers and puppies die in the process. Because they are bred to have unnaturally narrow hips, mothers will risk death without a c-section, and even with one, they can die from respiratory problems under anesthesia due to their restricted airways. Their puppies are often born with congenital problems, and a majority of surviving dogs (72%) will have health conditions. When orphaned, it is hard for even a seasoned rescuer to care for them. And so, for every French bulldog you see on Instagram, many had to suffer. Breeders know this, which is why it\u2019s all factored into the cost, as if suffering and death is nothing but a line-item expense in their business plan. It is a vile endeavor and nothing any animal lover should support.\n\nThese newborn babies came to us after a local rescue asked for help with a litter that had been surrendered to them in bad shape. These orphaned puppies were struggling on the bottle and needed tube feeding. I am currently tube feeding them every 2 hours to keep them stable. They are gaining weight and already looking a little better! I\u2019m grateful that they were given a fighting chance, but I\u2019m angry that human greed and aesthetic preference often takes precedent over the welfare of living beings. There is nothing okay about perpetuating congenital abnormalities for the sake of \u201ccuteness.\u201d I hope that in sharing their story, I can make it clear that there is nothing cute about breeding or buying French bulldogs. \ud83d\udc94", "date": "Dec 13, 2021", "views": "408,763 views", "comments": "3,133", "likes": "25,149 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 374.761, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgR3lBtwrLo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-OUzvhrDnM": {"title": "Betty White talks about her own death with Larry King", "content creator": "Pop Land", "description": "", "date": "Premiered Dec 31, 2021", "views": "541,266 views", "comments": "1,744", "likes": "25,015 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 60.501, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-OUzvhrDnM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_T-UzsvVF8": {"title": "willam belli being iconic for 9 minutes straight", "content creator": "fandompearl", "description": "MY BOAT IS PRETTY \ud83c\udfb6\u26f5\nincase you were wondering who the MOST iconic drag race queen is, its willam belli.

Some of the deer have been coming for more than 10 years including a piebald deer with more white markings than a normal white-tailed deer.  At times there are 100 to 200 deer at the pantry.  Wild turkeys also come and eat the native oats along side the deer.  At times you may see up to 100 wild turkeys at once.   There is no Chronic Wasting Disease, or CWD in wild deer in Maine.  Please dont complain about it in chat.  These deer are all very healthy and there has never been any type of disease spread among these deer.

According to his publicist, Williams had been battling severe depression.\n\nWilliams was best known for his starring roles in classic comedies like Mrs. Doubtfire, Good Morning, Vietnam and Jumanji, but also in dramas like Dead Poets Society. He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Dr. Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting. He rose to fame while playing Mork the alien in the TV show Mork & Mindy, a Happy Days spinoff.\n\nMost recently, Williams had starred in the new CBS sitcom 'The Crazy Ones.' It was cancelled after just one season. At his time of death, a sequel to Mrs. Doubtfire was in the works.\n\nSusan Schneider, the actor's wife, released the following statement to the New York Times' Dave Itzkoff:\n\n\"This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken. On behalf of Robin's family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope that the focus will not be on Robin's death but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.\"", "date": "Aug 11, 2014", "views": "11,340,907 views", "comments": "18,047", "likes": "84,684 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 89.401, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzebaSukpQg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciN4j1RUFkw": {"title": "Marine Combat on 'Bloody Nose Ridge' in the The Pacific's Battle of Peleliu with Frank Pomroy", "content creator": "American Veterans Center", "description": "A veteran of the Guadalcanal Campaign, Frank Pomroy had already been hardened by fierce combat by the time he hit the beaches of Peleliu in September of 1944.

He has a son, Robby Keene, with ex-girlfriend Shannon Keene, but he abandoned them both when both Robby was born and Johnny's mother Laura died on the same day. Johnny, admittedly, has never recovered from his breakup with then high school girlfriend, Ali Mills. After losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny rescues his teenage neighbour Miguel Diaz from a gang of bullies using karate. \n\nVisual effects (abbreviated VFX) is the process by which imagery is created or manipulated outside the context of a live action shot in filmmaking.

He has a son, Robby Keene, with ex-girlfriend Shannon Keene, but he abandoned them both when both Robby was born and Johnny's mother Laura died on the same day. Johnny, admittedly, has never recovered from his breakup with then high school girlfriend, Ali Mills.\n\nAfter losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny rescues his teenage neighbor Miguel Diaz from a gang of bullies using karate. Miguel, an asthmatic child raised by his Ecuadorian single mother Carmen, asks Johnny to teach him. Initially reluctant, Johnny finally agrees and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo as a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with Daniel LaRusso. Daniel, now the owner of a highly successful car dealership chain, is married to Amanda and has two children: Samantha and Anthony. Daniel is finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a child when he lived in Reseda. However, after his friend and mentor Mr. Miyagi died, Daniel's struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, his mother Lucille, his other source of support, has a complicated relationship with his wife Amanda.\n\nJohnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students Tommy, Bobby, Dutch, Jimmy and Johnny were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by John Kreese. Johnny develops a bond with his first and best student, Miguel, in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. Thus, Miguel develops into a very different kind of student than Daniel, or even Johnny, was; he also begins dating Samantha. Johnny's efforts to reform Cobra Kai are undermined by the unexpected reappearance of Kreese, who hopes to bring the dojo back to its originally ruthless form.\n\nAs a means of revenge against his estranged father, Robby convinces Amanda to hire him for a position at the LaRusso Auto dealership and develops a close friendship with Daniel (although Daniel is unaware of Robby's lineage). He even studies Mr. Miyagi's form of Karate with Daniel and becomes friendly with Samantha. She eventually joins her father's dojo, which ultimately leads to her breaking up with Miguel. Miguel later begins dating another Cobra Kai student, Tory, who is Sam's rival.\n\nThe developing story revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that are ultimately the product of Daniel and Johnny's inability to move away from the past.\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

As a result, we now have a powerful way to predict which patients with COVID pneumonia are more likely to die and require longer stays in the hospital. \n\nWe already know that less than 15% of people who get COVID have a severe disease to the point of requiring hospitalization. Less than 5% of people who get covid require ICU. For those with COVID pneumonia who require ICU, and for some of the other patients in the hospital who might not necessarily need ICU, these are the patients who have the cytokine storm that we keep hearing about, meaning the immune system is going haywire. There is a ton of inflammation in the body\u2026.especially the lungs. But now, we have a more specific way of predicting who is more likely to develop cytokine storm, and therefore more likely to die, and who is more likely to require a more extended stay in the hospital\u2026.and it's based on the bloodwork we get when patients are hospitalized.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nDoctor Mike Hansen's Programs \u23e9 \nFULL Course for MORE ENERGY:", "date": "Nov 18, 2020", "views": "2,302,221 views", "comments": "6,033", "likes": "43,466 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 469.881, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqNxSRcIQPY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaqWkRZjPHM": {"title": "25 Minutes of Extreme Natural Disasters", "content creator": "Underworld", "description": "25 Minutes of Extreme Weather & Natural Disasters Caught on Camera\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/3obsVlo", "date": "Jan 15, 2022", "views": "291,806 views", "comments": "222", "likes": "2,802 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1519.281, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaqWkRZjPHM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lMVX2eDIfI": {"title": "Ave Mar\u00eda en hebreo | Hail Mary in hebrew", "content creator": "Harpa Dei", "description": "Una composici\u00f3n propia del Ave Mar\u00eda en hebreo.\nEl  video fue filmado en la Capilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora, ubicada en la nave derecha de la Iglesia de la archiabad\u00eda benedictina Beuron; un lugar que apreciamos de forma especial y que presenta las joyas del arte beuronense.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nwww.harpadei.com\nTelegram: ", "date": "Mar 12, 2021", "views": "909,474 views", "comments": "1,186", "likes": "Unavailable", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 161.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lMVX2eDIfI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEgCI5fd5s4": {"title": "A housing bubble or #JustinFlation.", "content creator": "Pierre Poilievre", "description": "A housing bubble or #JustinFlation.", "date": "Jan 9, 2022", "views": "125,036 views", "comments": "2,382", "likes": "4,379 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 284.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEgCI5fd5s4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZWAtpRAXyA": {"title": "Most Dangerous Transports: Siberian Ice Road | Mega Transports | Free Documentary", "content creator": "Free Documentary", "description": "A Mega Transport on one of the most dangerous roads in the world \u2013 the Siberian Ice Road.

We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped. In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They\u2019re recorded by the artists in their home. It\u2019s the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nJune 17, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- On a brisk February morning, Alicia Keys, full of effervescence, entered NPR through the loading dock wearing a canary yellow faux fur coat. During our ride to the fourth floor, she joked about how she hadn't been invited to play at the Tiny Desk. That, of course, wasn't exactly true. We worked on and off for years to make this moment happen, and I can say wholeheartedly that it was worth the wait.\n\nAlicia Keys has an aura that you can sense the second she enters a room, or in my case, an elevator. She radiates compassion and kindness. This spirit is the key to Keys's songwriting, which is rooted in introspection and mindfulness.\n\nAs she approached her piano, a bit surprised at the amount of people in the room, she smiled and remarked over her shoulder, \"Gee, the Tiny Desk is tiny!\" She kicked off the set with an uncanny ode to combat the darkness of this moment in American history: \"Show Me Love,\" a single she released in 2019. No one could have predicted then how much her lyrics and musical healing would be crucial during this emotionally fraught time of unprecedented political and racial unrest, heightened by three months of quarantine due to a global pandemic.\n\nThe stand-out moment during her Tiny Desk was the premiere of \"Gramercy Park\", a song from her upcoming self-titled album, ALICIA, which is set to be released this fall. It's one of those timeless songs that will transcend radio formats and genres, with lyrics that address how utter selflessness and worrying about making everyone happy but yourself can throw your own center askew. The song's spiritual refrain is sure to be a sing-along moment for the rest of Keys's career.\n\nShe told the crowd after \"Gramercy Park\" that she's struggled with appeasing people her whole life, but she's trying harder now to set boundaries. Luckily for the Tiny Desk audience, that resolution didn't pertain to this concert. After wrapping up what was to be a three-song set with her latest single \"Underdog,\" which you may have seen her perform at this year's Grammys, the crowd begged for an encore. After crowdsourcing suggestions, she and her band delivered a riveting rendition of Keys's breakout 2001 single, \"Fallin'.\"\n\nThe world, now more than ever, needs more love, reflection and accountability \u2013 a mantra that's woven into every fiber of Alicia Keys's being and every lyric of her songs.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Show Me Love\"\n\"Gramercy Park\"\n\"Underdog\"\n\"Fallin'\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAlicia Keys: vocals, piano; RAII & Whitney: vocals; Ant Parrish: bass; Curt Chambers: guitar; Mike Reid: drums; Omar Edwards: keys.\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, Natasha Branch; Videographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Melany Rochester, Shanti Hands; Editor: Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Kisha Ravi/NPR", "date": "Jun 22, 2020", "views": "22,786,009 views", "comments": "11,080", "likes": "320,283 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1666.841, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwUt1fVLb3E"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH8XPT8cLQU": {"title": "How to Discipline your child and toddler, without hitting - Jordan Peterson", "content creator": "Dose of Truth", "description": "Please, like, share, subscribe and comment!\n\nJordan Peterson's Links:\nPatreon: ", "date": "Mar 15, 2018", "views": "1,650,844 views", "comments": "3,186", "likes": "43,177 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 585.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH8XPT8cLQU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBRgEDTWrB4": {"title": "Ibiza Summer Mix 2022 \ud83c\udf53 Best Of Tropical Deep House Music Chill Out Mix #26", "content creator": "Hot Vibes", "description": "Ibiza Summer Mix 2022 \ud83c\udf53 Best Of Tropical Deep House Music Chill Out Mix #26\n\n#Deephouse #Chillout #Houserelax2022 #Summermix2022 #Summermusicmix2022", "date": "Streamed live on Jan 15, 2022", "views": "13,703 views", "comments": "2", "likes": "68 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 42898.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBRgEDTWrB4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bamaEMftg4": {"title": "Natural versus vaccine immunity", "content creator": "Dr. John Campbell", "description": "Post infection natural immunity, debate and implications for mandatory vaccination\n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n...", "date": "Oct 2, 2021", "views": "2,393,994 views", "comments": "17,021", "likes": "61,721 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1314.201, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bamaEMftg4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50l5xusNz-0": {"title": "January 6th, one...year...later!", "content creator": "Jericho Green", "description": "https://noblegoldinvestments.com/", "date": "Jan 8, 2022", "views": "34,010 views", "comments": "989", "likes": "4,933 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1116.321, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50l5xusNz-0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkWlIhaeuaY": {"title": "NEVER DO THIS....Revolver Edition", "content creator": "Jerry Miculek - Pro Shooter", "description": "Hey Everyone!

First, Dave shares a clip from \"The View\" of Jedediah Bila being grilled by Joy Behar for being unvaccinated and against vaccine mandates. Watch how Joy, Sunny Hostin, and Whoopi Goldberg react when Jedediah reasonably asserts some basic established facts about how COVID is transmitted. Next, Dave shares a clip from a Jen Psaki press conference where she tries to convince reporters that high gas prices are actually beneficial because they will force us to increase our investment in renewable energy. Tell that to struggling families who are being crushed by inflation and climbing oil prices. Dave also shares a clip from the COP26 summit of Minister of Environment and Climate Change of Canada Steven Guilbeault demanding that indigenous people have a say in climate change solutions. Finally, Dave shares good news from Florida. Ron DeSantis and other governors challenged the Biden employer vaccine mandate and now courts have ordered a halt to the rule. Will red states like Florida be able to halt other federal COVID restrictions and  demands for proof of vaccination?\n\n----------\n\nToday\u2019s Sponsors:\nCozy Earth - This holiday season, give the gift that will be appreciated every single night - Cozy Earth bedding and loungewear\nSleep comfortably year-round.

Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To, and the host of the Lifespan Podcast, which launches January 5, 2022. \n\nIn this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the aging process. We discuss fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin, and NMN. We also discuss the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure, and why excessive iron load is bad for us. We discuss food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells). And we discuss the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine your biological versus chronological age. We also discuss the future of longevity research and technology. This episode includes lots of basic science and specific, actionable protocols, right down to the details of what to do and when. By the end, you will have in-depth knowledge of the biology of aging and how to offset it.\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - ", "date": "Dec 27, 2021", "views": "795,378 views", "comments": "2,403", "likes": "25,884 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 7842.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxSfDQum6sM": {"title": "The LARGEST Galaxy In The Universe! | IC 1101", "content creator": "Factnomenal", "description": "The largest currently known galaxy has the generic designation of IC 1101, some 1.045 billion light years from Earth.

The property is just stunning. Wildlife call this property their home. From deer, ducks to wild turkeys they are everywhere here. There is rolling hills, large pond and beautiful in ground pool. The house is massive, it has 6 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms and 3 kitchens. I couldn\u2019t believe how much stuff was left behind here. Pretty much every room has personal items left behind. This property sits on a few acres and was bought up a few years ago by a developer. It hasn\u2019t been abandoned for very long.
