Some MCU actors like Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd were far from ripped and muscular when they were cast in their respective roles. However, they put in the work to attain the fit and athletic bodies they sport on screen. This is no easy feat, as getting your body into peak shape is an incredibly difficult task. Sometimes it take\u2019s over a year of strict dieting and workout plans to achieve their goals. And then years more maintaining this shape for future movies in the MCU. Luckily for them, they are provided with top of the line trainers and dieticians that help them along their journey. This definitely helps, but it\u2019s still on the actors to apply themselves to the regimes assigned. Which actors had difficulties maintaining their diets?\nSometimes the trainers used by these actors are actually good friends with them, as is the case with Chris Hemsworth, who has known his trainer since he was four years old.\n\nAll those muscles aren\u2019t just for show, and these actors have done some seriously impressive things. One of the Marvel stars can now push a 5,000 pound jeep. Do you think it\u2019s Captain America or Captain Marvel who showcased this feat of strength?\n\nWhich actor do you think had the most impressive transformation?\n\nSubscribe: ", "date": "Oct 30, 2021", "views": "4,075,910 views", "comments": "685", "likes": "49,740 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 488.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsFkJrWNEHE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggs6zI9qKKY": {"title": "Impractical Jokers 200th Episode: 200 Min of Punishments | truTV", "content creator": "truTV", "description": "In honor of the Impractical Jokers 200th episode, here are 200 minutes of punishments!

Duxford\u2019s Bf 109 is an E-3/E-4 variant. It was attacked by Spitfires in late 1940 and crash-landed in a field in relatively good condition.

In essence, once China grew wealthy, a US-China cold war was inevitable. Had US policymakers understood this logic in the early 1990s, they would have tried to slow down Chinese growth and maximise the power gap between Beijing and Washington.\n\nHowever, the US did the opposite: it pursued a policy of engagement, which aimed to help China grow wealthier \u2013 based on the assumption that China would become a democracy and a responsible stakeholder, which would lead to a more peaceful world. Instead of fostering harmonious relations between China and the US, engagement led to an intense rivalry.\n\nIs Australia and the world in deep trouble? Absent a major internal Chinese crisis, Washington and Beijing are consigned to waging a dangerous security competition. Can we manage on the margins to prevent disaster?\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is professor of political science and international relations at the University of Chicago and author of The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001).

Acorn and Pumpkin were having another noisy fight. Usually this stops with aggressive sounds like teeth chattering, but today Acorn was ready to attack to defend her food. Despite being a small pig, she mustered a mighty jumping bite that can only be witnessed in super slow motion. Pumpkin never saw it coming.\n\nIn response, Zucchin decides it's time to flee, taking an entire leaf for herself. Butternut just seems confused as usual.\n\nDon't worry, the pigs are OK and getting along since their fight! If anything, Pumpkin is just embarrassed she got tackled in front of the whole herd. Guinea pigs have minor fights while bonding to establish dominance and set the pecking order. Acorn is growing and getting stronger so she's restarting old fights to advance in the pig rankings.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S PIGS?\n\nWe publish daily highlights of the adorable antics of our guinea pig herd. Subscribe to see what they do tomorrow!\n\nIn June 2019 we adopted five pigs from Los Angeles Guinea Pig Rescue. They are cute herbivorous pets with funny social interactions. We film all their behaviors, from cute guinea pig noises to eating sounds, playing with their food to sleeping with their eyes open, and occasional fighting. So far they have been most popular for their loud wheeking and rumblestrutting and their ridiculous guinea pig fights!\n\nOur videos generally have no talking so they're great in any language, whether you search for guinea pigs as cobayos, conejillos de indias, cochons d'Inde, meerschweinchen, mor\u010de, marsvin, cavia, marsu, tengerimalac, marmot, porcellino d'India, cobaia, gine domuzu, chu\u1ed9t b\u1ea1ch, \u015bwinka morska, \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430, \u062e\u0648\u06a9\u0686\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u062f\u06cc ,\u062e\u0646\u0632\u064a\u0631 \u063a\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0627, \u8c5a\u9f20, \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8, \uae30\ub2c8\ud53c\uadf8, or \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39\u0e15\u0e30\u0e40\u0e20\u0e32!\n\nMEET THE PIG FAMILY\n\nSpaghett is the boar of the herd. The rest of the pigs are females, but he\u2019s a neutered male so they won\u2019t be breeding. Sorry, no pregnant or baby guinea pigs! Spaghett has orange-brown fur with a white crest on his head and cute red eyes. He goes on morning romps with entertaining popcorning and zoomies. He does a hilarious rumblestrutting dance for the ladies while purring. When pigs argue he trots over to comfort them. He burrows through hay and stands on his back feet like a goofy dinosaur.\n\nAcorn is youngest so we call her little Acorn. She has white, black, and gold fur with a cute mousy face. She\u2019s inquisitive, always wants food, and talks to herself while exploring hay piles. She\u2019s always the last one eating while the others nap. Little Acorn\u2019s special talent is jumping on houses to go on rooftop adventures.\n\nButternut appears either confused or deep in thought, but we speculate she is just a very philosophical pig. She has white and gold fur. She\u2019s the lowest ranking pig so she stares into space while waiting for other pigs to move. Her hobbies include sleeping and yawning while flopped over with her feet sprawled out. She continues wheeking and squeaking at us after we have already given her food.\n\nPumpkin has black fur except for white back toes. She looks like a cow, a non-guinea pig, and a rabbit. She has noisy standoffs with little Acorn when Acorn gets too feisty. Pumpkin seems receptive to Spaghett\u2019s rumblestrutting and occasionally she chases him around instead.\n\nZucchin is oldest and grumpiest. She has white and gray fur with cute red eyes. At first Zucchin fought with Spaghett. There were teeth chattering, nose raising, and hair puffing battles. Now they get along, but Zucchin is still a grouch. Her main hobby is being an eel and lunging at anyone who comes near. She likes to chase other pigs out of their homes, then follow them to another home and chase them out of that one too. But she looks like a cute rat!\n\nTHEIR HOME\n\nThe pigs live in a custom 4 by 6 foot cage made by merging 3 MidWest Guinea Habitat cages. We cut the seams of the cage bottoms and joined them into one large cage liner. Now we have a triple size MidWest cage! The pigs first lived in the 3 cages connected by ramps.\n\nThe bedding is fleece blankets with towels underneath and newspaper on the bottom. Each day we change one third of the bedding and spot clean several times.\n\nThe pigs prefer free stuff to actual guinea pig toys. They love to hide under packing paper. A DIY guinea pig house made from a cardboard box is a favorite hidey. They are not interested in most chew toys.\n\nTHEIR DIET\n\nTheir favorite hay is 3rd cut timothy hay from Small Pet Select. They gobble up guinea pig pellets.\n\nThey eat nearly any vegetable. The only thing rejected so far was zucchini.

I wanted to get to Tibet Guesthouse as soon as possible to start the day like any real man should: with a fresh shot of Gongo!\n\nWhat I didn't expect though was to run into the coolest and nicest couple I met on my whole Himalayan trekking adventure. A couple that started the very first lodge at the Hotel Lama location over 40 years ago and are still running that same guesthouse today.\n\n\u25a0 Now before you watch, or after for that matter, I'd like to comment on what you see in the very beginning here, which I actually fully understand given the hard times hotel and guesthouse operators face, but still rubs me the wrong way. As I'm walking into this area here called Lama hotel I already knew where I was going: Tibet Guesthouse. \n\nEvery-time I entered a cluster of guesthouses like this, the people who run the first hotels and restaurants will of course be outside trying their best get you to stop at theirs. In this case however I knew where I was going and clearly stated I was going to Tibet Guesthouse, although I didn't know exactly which building that was. \n\nInstead of simply pointing it out for me, they answer evasively on all my questions and instead say something along the lines of why don't I stop at their hotel instead.\n\nNormally I am fairly good and ignoring such people but in this case I was so obsessed with hunting for Gongo that they nearly got the better of me.
