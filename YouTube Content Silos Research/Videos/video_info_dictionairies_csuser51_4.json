Let's discuss!\n\nFUN FACT I GLOSSED OVER IN THE VIDEO: like I said, it's REALLY hard to determine when these constellations entered Greece. Most people set the date at 300ish, when Eudoxus codified the Greek calendar based on the Babylonian one - but that clashes with the fact that Heracles's labors predate that by at least three centuries, and they've had those zodiacal themes since that lost epic poem was initially written. We know, therefore, that the babylonian zodiac entered greece between Homer's time (when he conspicuously didn't mention them - and neither did Hesiod in his Astronomia) and Peisander's time (author of the lost Heracleia), basically the interval between 800 and 600 CE. The phoenician traders carrying that info is a reasonable assumption, especially considering how important the stars are to sailors navigating at night.

His name was Semyon Dukatch, and stories swirled in his wake. Some said he was a Russian arms dealer, others a pop star from Eastern Europe. But the truth was even more unlikely: he was a twenty-one year old graduate student who had a plan that would one day make him richer than anyone could possibly imagine. The Darling of Las Vegas quickly became a legend in the casino world. He is the only person banned from the island of Aruba. He was held, at gunpoint, in a cave in Monte Carlo and told that if he ever returned, he'd be murdered.

First, Dave shares some of the most cringe-worthy moments from yesterday\u2019s Biden press conference. It was filled with stumbling, nonsensical statements, a call for more social media censorship, and ignored any questions from the press. Next, Dave discusses the Supreme Court\u2019s mixed rulings in a pair of cases challenging the Biden administration COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The Supreme Court blocked the OSHA vaccine mandate for large businesses, but upheld the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers. Finally, Dave shares a clip of Ronald Reagan where he describes how big government can entrench itself in our lives and the slippery slope that can lead to totalitarianism and authoritarianism. It\u2019s hard to articulate the slippery slope argument better than the great communicator himself, as he calls for a more limited government.\n\n----------\n\nWatch The Rubin Report on BlazeTV:", "date": "Jan 14, 2022", "views": "114,599 views", "comments": "2,033", "likes": "12,790 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1517.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MYa2YID1I0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYShB-DzYO8": {"title": "Hasan Hears Hot Takes From The Audience | Deep Cuts | Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj | Netflix", "content creator": "Netflix Is A Joke", "description": "On the latest Deep Cuts, Hasan hears some hot takes from one Patriot Act audience member in particular who recently went viral on Twitter for his opinions on aliens, apex predators, and swimming pools.

Almost all researchers who write manuscripts will receive rejection letters from journals, especially in the beginning stages of their careers, and thus rejection should be seen as a learning experience rather than something to be dejected about.\n\nThis reality raises the question all researchers must ask themselves: \u201cWhy are my manuscripts being rejected?\u201d And from a wider perspective: \u201cWhat are so many manuscripts so often rejected?\u201d\n\nOne likely answer to this question is that there is a deficiency in \u201cquality of writing\u201d in a great many manuscripts. This can lead not only to rejections, but to continued requests for revision and resubmission (if the research itself is deemed significant and valid), as well as deferment, costing researchers extra time, money, and effort. While there is endless excellent research being conducted at any given time, the manuscripts that get published will combine novelty, relevancy, impact, and other scientific parameters of a good manuscript with another parameter whose importance is often overlooked: \u201cquality of writing.\u201d This is the topic of my presentation today.\n\n\nThis video includes:\n\u2714 A comprehensive overview of common problems with \u201cquality of writing\u201d in research papers submitted to journals\n\u2714 Graphics and slides from studies that breakdown the errors in content, grammar, and style derived from millions of edited words in research papers\n\u2714 Tips and suggestions for authors in eliminating these errors prior to submitting their manuscripts \n\nWho should watch this video:\n\u2605Research writers writing a paper for a journal or conference\n\u2605Students interested in learning how to edit their work\n\nFor more useful writing tips, check out these posts on our \u201cResources\u201d page:\n\n\u201cHow to Write the Best Journal Submissions Cover Letter\"", "date": "Feb 12, 2018", "views": "42,678 views", "comments": "19", "likes": "865 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2899.081, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0P_UVPCni4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMGzzDk3ec4": {"title": "Hasan Offers A Student Some Much Needed Advice | Deep Cuts | Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj | Netflix", "content creator": "Netflix Is A Joke", "description": "The start of this Deep Cuts is a bit out of the ordinary as a pair of moms try to adopt Hasan and move him to the suburbs.

Here, he reacts to 11 memorable scenes from DC movies and rates them based on their accuracy. \n\nKakalios addresses physical feats of DC superheroes, such as Joker in \"Suicide Squad\" jumping from an extreme height into a shallow vat of acid and Harley Quinn in \"Birds of Prey\" skating behind an automobile at high speed. He looks at the realism of superheroes' incredible skills, such as Aquaman's ability to sonically communicate with sharks and other fish. Would Shazam be able to charge up a mobile phone by shooting bolts of lightning at it? What material would Wonder Woman's bracelets need to be in order to deflect bullets?\n\nSuperman and Batman come under scrutiny in the video. Kakalios looks at Bruce Wayne's cape's rigidity in \"Batman Begins\" and whether it would allow Batman to fly across Gotham City. Would Superman be able to turn back time by flying around the world? Why can't he see through lead in \"Man of Steel\"? And finally, what are the odds that both Batman and Superman have mothers named Martha? Kakalios calculates the odds from \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\" \n\nKakalios is the author of three books, \"The Physics of Superheroes,\" \"The Physics of Everyday Things,\" and \"The Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics.\" He also worked as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. film \"Watchmen\" and won a regional Emmy for the video \"Science of Watchmen.\" A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.\n\nFor more, visit:", "date": "Oct 13, 2020", "views": "603,296 views", "comments": "1,237", "likes": "16,930 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1281.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFgS-dEITHQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI": {"title": "Accent Expert Breaks Down 6 Fictional Languages From Film & TV | WIRED", "content creator": "WIRED", "description": "Dialect coach Erik Singer analyzes some of the most famous \"constructed languages\" in movie and television history.

The conjecture asks whether, under iteration of the map T, any positive integer eventually reaches the value one.

Let T be a map from the positive integers into itself, where T(x)=x/2 if x is even and T(x) = (3x+1)/2 if x is odd. The conjecture asks whether, under iteration of the map T, any positive integer eventually reaches the value one.

As a corollary Mason obtained a very simple proof of \"Fermat's Last Theorem\" for polynomials. Inspired by Mason's observations, Masser and Oesterl e proposed an analogous inequality for integers, which has come to be known as the ABC conjecture. In this talk I will discuss Mason's inequality, some of its applications, and the resulting ABC conjecture for integers. The talk should be accessible to a general mathematical audience.\n\nVideo taken from:", "date": "Jul 7, 2016", "views": "15,664 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\n#0 0x5616c1675a23 <unknown>\n#1 0x5616c1140e18 <unknown>\n#2 0x5616c1177151 <unknown>\n#3 0x5616c1177311 <unknown>\n#4 0x5616c11a9ec4 <unknown>\n#5 0x5616c11949bd <unknown>\n#6 0x5616c11a7c5b <unknown>\n#7 0x5616c1194883 <unknown>\n#8 0x5616c116a3fa <unknown>\n#9 0x5616c116b4c5 <unknown>\n#10 0x5616c16a516d <unknown>\n#11 0x5616c16bb5bb <unknown>\n#12 0x5616c16a6e75 <unknown>\n#13 0x5616c16bbe85 <unknown>\n#14 0x5616c169a86f <unknown>\n#15 0x5616c16d6ae8 <unknown>\n#16 0x5616c16d6c68 <unknown>\n#17 0x5616c16f1aad <unknown>\n#18 0x7f75bd51e6db <unknown>\n", "likes": "Unavailable", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3329.801, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYisYYhKKYA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCsD3ZGzMgE": {"title": "The Josephus Problem - Numberphile", "content creator": "Numberphile", "description": "The Josephus Problem, featuring Daniel Erman from University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nWinning at Dots and Boxes: https://youtu.be/KboGyIilP6k\nMore links & stuff in full description below \u2193\u2193\u2193\n\nCorrection: Around ", "date": "Oct 28, 2016", "views": "6,040,086 views", "comments": "5,891", "likes": "167,751 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 837.181, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCsD3ZGzMgE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA0QMTNpWdo": {"title": "Ultron Bites A Galaxy | Marvel's What If? #mcu #whatif #marvel #ultron #mc", "content creator": "The WRLD", "description": "I don't own rights to this clip, all rights belong to marvel studios, #marvel", "date": "Sep 30, 2021", "views": "246,762 views", "comments": "371", "likes": "2,533 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 17.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA0QMTNpWdo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZpLmavPs54": {"title": "you cannot compute the power of my\u2013", "content creator": "Valenzemo", "description": "the watcher strong", "date": "Oct 17, 2021", "views": "541,803 views", "comments": "385", "likes": "14,716 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 22.061, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZpLmavPs54"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3BPnVE9T24": {"title": "hulk owns", "content creator": "darthporkius", "description": "here bruce banner loses control of the hulk and all hell breaks lose.", "date": "Apr 8, 2009", "views": "156,460 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\n#0 0x5616c1675a23 <unknown>\n#1 0x5616c1140e18 <unknown>\n#2 0x5616c1177151 <unknown>\n#3 0x5616c1177311 <unknown>\n#4 0x5616c11a9ec4 <unknown>\n#5 0x5616c11949bd <unknown>\n#6 0x5616c11a7c5b <unknown>\n#7 0x5616c1194883 <unknown>\n#8 0x5616c116a3fa <unknown>\n#9 0x5616c116b4c5 <unknown>\n#10 0x5616c16a516d <unknown>\n#11 0x5616c16bb5bb <unknown>\n#12 0x5616c16a6e75 <unknown>\n#13 0x5616c16bbe85 <unknown>\n#14 0x5616c169a86f <unknown>\n#15 0x5616c16d6ae8 <unknown>\n#16 0x5616c16d6c68 <unknown>\n#17 0x5616c16f1aad <unknown>\n#18 0x7f75bd51e6db <unknown>\n", "likes": "2,417 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 439.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3BPnVE9T24"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-JG_-GUiMU": {"title": "Game Of Thrones Season 2 - Stannis vs Renly", "content creator": "V\u00edtor Andriotti", "description": "S02E04.\n\n\nHome Box Office, Inc.

Moderated by Stacey Wilson Hunt, New York Magazine.\n\nAndrew Garfield is an AcademyAward\u00ae-nominated actor who captivates global audiences with his transformative performances spanning feature films and notable theatre productions. He continues to evolve his body of work in powerful roles and compelling narratives.\n\nIn 2016, Garfield appeared on the big screen in Mel Gibson\u2019s Academy Award\u00ae-nominated World War II epic, HACKSAW RIDGE. Based on a true story, Garfield plays U.S. Army medic Desmond T. Doss, who was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Truman for single-handedly saving the lives of over 75 of his comrades while simultaneously under constant enemy fire during the brutal Battle of Okinawa. The film, which co-starred Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving, Brenda Griffiths and Teresa Palmer, was released by Lionsgate on November 4th, 2016. Garfield\u2019s critically acclaimed performance earned him lead actor nominations at the Academy Awards\u00ae, Golden Globe Awards\u00ae, Screen Actors Guild Awards and BAFTA Awards.\n\nGarfield also starred in Martin Scorsese\u2019s adaptation of the literary classic SILENCE, distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film tells a story of young 17th-century Jesuit missionaries who were persecuted during their search for a priest who had forsaken his faith. The film also starred Liam Neeson and Adam Driver.\n\nHe was recently on stage once again in the National Theatre\u2019s production of ANGELS IN AMERICA directed by Tony Award\u00ae-winning Marianne Elliott. He plays \u201cPrior Walter,\u201d alongside Denise Gough, Nathan Lane, James McArdle and Russell Tovey.\n\nGarfield currently stars in Andy Serkis\u2019 drama BREATHE, based on the true story of the handsome, brilliant and adventurous Robin Cavendish (Garfield). Said to only have three months to live after being diagnosed with polio at the age of 28, Robin became a medical miracle and a champion for the disabled as he defied the odds stacked against him and lived until the age of 64.\n\nLater this year, Garfield will star in the modern noir crime thriller UNDER THE SILVER LAKE. Set in the underbelly of Silver Lake, California, the film follows an eccentric man who becomes obsessed with the disappearance of his neighbor and the murder of another man. The film is written and directed by David Robert Mitchell and will be distributed by A24.\n\nAdditional film credits include: Marc Webb\u2019s THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN and THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2, which combined grossed over 1.5 billion at the box-office; Ramin Bahrani\u2019s 99 HOMES opposite Michael Shannon and Laura Dern; David Fincher\u2019s THE SOCIAL NETWORK, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe\u00ae for Best Supporting Actor; Mark Romanek\u2019s NEVER LET ME GO opposite Keira Knightley and Carey Mulligan; Terry Gilliam\u2019s THE IMAGINARIUM OF DR. PARNASSUS; Spike Jonze\u2019s robot lovestory I\u2019M HERE; Robert Redford\u2019s LIONS FOR LAMBS; Julian Jarrold\u2019s RED RIDINGTRILOGY - 1974; and John Crowley\u2019s BOY A, for which he earned BAFTA\u2019s BestActor Award in 2008.\n\nGarfield made his Broadway debutin 2012 in the revival of Arthur Miller\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning play DEATH OF A SALESMAN, opposite Phillip Seymour-Hoffman and directed by Mike Nichols. His portrayal of Biff Loman earned him a Tony\u00aenomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play.", "date": "Nov 17, 2017", "views": "132,125 views", "comments": "123", "likes": "3,232 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4743.901, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm-V4W4eze0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8HqyuLBqnU": {"title": "73 Questions With Emma Stone | Vogue", "content creator": "Vogue", "description": "Emma Stone shows off her fabulous dance moves, belts out a killer Britney Spears impression, and admits to crying in front of Tom Hanks. \n\nFilmed in a single shot, we ask some of our favorite personalities 73 questions to see what they like, what they hate, and most importantly \u2013 what they know.\n\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Vogue on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba ", "date": "Oct 18, 2016", "views": "17,545,821 views", "comments": "11,020", "likes": "260,205 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 555.841, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8HqyuLBqnU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fmw9hVPwDIU": {"title": "Building the Southern Hemisphere's Highest Residences", "content creator": "The B1M", "description": "Rising 100 storeys above the historically swampy area of Melbourne's Southbank, Australia 108 will be home to the highest residences in the southern hemisphere.

How it works? How to unleash the potential power of CDE?\n\nAbstract:  What is the BIM adoption rate in Hong Kong? How should we measure the KPIs of BIM? In this sharing, as the consultant of the CIC BIM Adoption Survey 2020, Tang will present key findings on the demand and supply of BIM in Hong Kong from this survey. \nTang will also demonstrate how different cutting-edge technologies (e.g. PropTech, ConTech and GreenTech) integrate to support digital twins' creation for project and asset management using an ISO19650-compliant Common Data Environment (CDE), which is the heart of information management; How does it work? How do we unleash the potential power of CDE? This acts as a holistic digital asset portfolio to analyse, visualise, maintain, and optimise the performance of our built assets throughout the project life cycle.\n\nSpeaker:  Ir Dr Llewellyn Tang, Founder & CEO, Llewellyn & Partners Co. Ltd. (LPC), Associate Professor of BIM, Programme Director, Master of Science in Integrated Project Delivery (IPD), Department of Real Estate and Construction, Faculty of Architecture, HKU\n\nBiography: Tang is one of the pioneering advocates of BIM and digitalisation to drive the Smart City Blueprint. With over a decade of practical experience in BIM adoption and development in the U.K. and China on majors buildings and infrastructure projects, Tang has brought international best practices and leading-edge R&D on BIM training, innovation and research into Asia-Pacific, especially Hong Kong and Great Bay Area. In early 2018, Tang pioneered UK BIM level 2 into China for a real estate developer, helping her tap the most value of this international standard for their digitalisation journey. The same year, the team formulated a strategic framework for the national new smart city (Xiongan New Area) based on A.I., BIM, IoT, and Blockchain technologies presented in TEDx 2018. \nLeveraging the lessons learnt and over 100 internationally leading publications, Tang has been engaging with the Hong Kong construction industry stakeholders to deliver benchmarking, research, projects, and trainings in BIM and digitalisation solutions. His achievements have been recognised and awarded the BIMers 2020 by the Construction Industry Council. In Q1 2021, LPC was given the Gold Award for Emerging BIM company in the HKIBIM Awards 2020. Internationally, the LPC research team\u2019s inventions (BIM Warehouse) were awarded Silver Medal at the Special Edition 2021 Inventions Geneva Evaluation Days. LPC star products - AutoCDE and AutoBIM were awarded BSI Kitemark for BIM Software in March 2021 as a global benchmark of full compliance with the ISO19650 series.

Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. \n\nHanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. \n\nHanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers. \n\nFor further information: ", "date": "May 6, 2019", "views": "7,511,082 views", "comments": "1,506", "likes": "76,622 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3600.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEXL5USuDGI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NXC4Q_4JVg": {"title": "The Atlantic slave trade: What too few textbooks told you - Anthony Hazard", "content creator": "TED-Ed", "description": "Check out our Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/teded\n\nView full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-atlanti...", "date": "Dec 22, 2014", "views": "9,137,360 views", "comments": "19,175", "likes": "139,649 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 338.061, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NXC4Q_4JVg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUz1nCRJJBg": {"title": "PragerU's TERRIFYING Parenting Advice | A Response to PragerU", "content creator": "Zoe Bee", "description": "Conservative YouTube channel PragerU shares parenting advice that's not just outdated, but also pretty terrifying.

Then, I use an item clip out of bounds on the left side of the room, getting down to 1 HP in the process. Then, I make my way to the left side of the scanner by Thudley jumping. Meanwhile, I put Mario on a precise Z-axis position so that he's aligned with the right pole of the scanner. The final Thudley jump must be in 2D, I drop inside of the scanner pole between X coordinate 0 and 1 in order to set my respawn coordinates there, and I eat a poison shroom. For unknown reasons, the geometry near the front wall of the room is very weird, and after flipping in the air, my Z position gets offset outside of the room, where I start doing more Thudley jumps. Finally, I get the poison damage at the same time as entering the scanner trigger at around Y coordinate 300. If I fall for too long during a cutscene, the game won't wait forever, and will start the cutscene in mid-air. By specifically timing a respawn right at the point when I get kicked out of the scanner, I get back to X coordinate 0 and don't get knocked back through X -1. Therefore, the scanner won't trigger again if I walk through it, and I can enter the door to the painting room.\n\nSuper Paper Mario Speedrunning Discord: ", "date": "Jul 12, 2020", "views": "726 views", "comments": "7", "likes": "37 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 69.001, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJMClAMLsAc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67TxqOrW2gM": {"title": "Otamatone becoming CANNY", "content creator": "TheRealSullyG", "description": "The sequel nobody asked for...\n\n*Affiliate Links*\nBrowse all Otamatones: ", "date": "Jan 17, 2022", "views": "257,109 views", "comments": "846", "likes": "21,391 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 50.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67TxqOrW2gM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iv0TAGpe5U": {"title": "Lobster - Cosmos (Featuring Nelnalium Art)", "content creator": "kandriod", "description": "Cosmos composed by the Artist \"The Official lobst\" And Alpha drawn by the Artist Nelnal: https://twitter.com/nelnalium", "date": "Feb 25, 2021", "views": "8,766 views", "comments": "23", "likes": "310 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 180.061, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iv0TAGpe5U"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N8hsXQapjY": {"title": "History vs. Vladimir Lenin - Alex Gendler", "content creator": "TED-Ed", "description": "View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/history-vs-...\n\nVladimir Lenin overthrew Russian Czar Nicholas II and founded the Soviet Union, forever changing the course of Russian politics.

Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.\n\nIn this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u2019s original holy city \u2013 as detailed in the Qur\u2019an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u2019s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u2018forbidden gathering place\u2019. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.\n\nIn the film \u2018The Sacred City\u2019 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u2013 while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.\n\nWhile clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u2019s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u2019an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.\n\nIn a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.\n\nBeautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

Focusing on women of royalty such as Pharaoh Hatshepsut and Queen Nefertari, as well as women of high profession such as Lady Peseshet, the earliest female doctor known to the world, Fletcher reveals an ancient civilization unparalleled in its sexual equality.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

But Arrian had access to eyewitness accounts which are now lost (principally Ptolemy and Nearchus), and modern historians generally agree that the speech was a real historical event, and that Arrian gives a good representation of its likely content.\n\nPutting its (contested and debated) value as a historical source to one side, the scene - as it appears in Arrian - is a brilliantly written moment of high drama and emotion, in which Alexander first highlights his debt to his father Philip, before launching into a tirade in which he lists his own astounding achievements and qualities of leadership. \n\nThe speech has been abridged and edited by myself for this video. \nYou can read Arrian's full version in English translation here: ", "date": "Aug 10, 2018", "views": "6,967,855 views", "comments": "24,330", "likes": "236,176 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 458.341, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlKJDwViNKs&list=RDLVRlKJDwViNKs&start_radio=1&rv=RlKJDwViNKs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8HdOHrc3OQ": {"title": "[Best Version] The Great Dictator Speech - Charlie Chaplin + Time - Hans Zimmer (INCEPTION Theme)", "content creator": "LinkTheCoward", "description": "New exciting content! \u21e8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QRm...\n\nCharlie Chaplin's speech from \"The Great Dictator\" together with Hans Zimmer's \"Time\" from the movie \"INCEPTION\" = EPIC!!!\n\nLike on Facebook: ", "date": "May 29, 2011", "views": "13,559,823 views", "comments": "19,419", "likes": "276,359 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 243.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8HdOHrc3OQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nusqEmGik-Y": {"title": "Alexander the Great IN ANCIENT GREEK!", "content creator": "Epic History TV", "description": "Massive thanks to Barefaced Greek for their expert help in making this video.

It will be revealed through the eyes and personal experiences of an African-American doctor in North Carolina, including his observations of the relationships between white doctors and black patients, and between black doctors and white patients. He will also compare the availability and quality of medical care provided to black and white patients, offering suggestions for tackling the discrimination problem.\nDr. Damon Tweedy, a Duke Medical School graduate, personally learned in school and in the wider medical world that racial prejudice exists in medicine in both overt and subtle ways. He felt it as an African-American medical student and as a practicing physician, and he saw it firsthand in the treatment of white and black patients by black and white doctors, respectively, and by discrimination he experienced even in medical school. He completed his medical internship and psychiatric residency at Duke Hospital and is currently Professor of Psychiatry at Duke and staff psychologist at Durham VA Medical Center. He gained national prominence when he wrote a book, published in 2015, titled Black Man In A White Coat: A Doctor's Reflections On Race And Medicine, asking, \"Is being black bad for your health?\" The book reached the New York Times Bestseller List and was rated by TIME magazine as among the \"Top Ten Non-Fiction Books of 2015.\" He will sign copies of this book after his lecture.", "date": "Streamed live on Jul 19, 2018", "views": "1,339 views", "comments": "0", "likes": "10 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 7286.401, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58i-zAUXrBs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYFXZ9fc6pg": {"title": "War Thunder Hide n' Seek w/ Viewers 3!", "content creator": "Bo Time Gaming", "description": "Interested in purchasing something from the War Thunder Store?

Designed by R.J. Mitchell, this fighter was the pinnacle of aircraft design when it was built, and remained a legend when the age of jets took over. I take a look at its full story, from R.J. Mitchell's first steps as an aircraft designer, to the first Spitfires coming off the production line. Spitfires took part in all the major theatres during WWII, and I've hand-picked a few of its most notable experiences, detailing the role it had to play from shooting down He 111s during the Battle of Britain, to fighting Me 262 jets during the invasion.\n\nI've been especially careful to make sure every single fact, figure and story is checked to make sure I'm giving you the truth. However, given the scale of this project, and the fact it's only me doing the writing and research, mistakes are to be expected somewhere, so see below for what to do if you find any. \n\nLike I mentioned, this project was massive, probably the biggest thing I've ever done, and there was so much knowledge and information about the Spitfire and the events surrounding it that didn't make the cut, so if you have any questions, leave them below and I'll make sure to answer them as best I can. There are so many myths and lies that I've uncovered by just digging a little deeper, so clearing up any of those would be a pleasure.\n\nTwitter: ", "date": "Aug 30, 2020", "views": "78,976 views", "comments": "395", "likes": "1,836 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4317.541, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqIKzdlHQfo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBfic_SIAoc": {"title": "Hawkeye Pitch Meeting", "content creator": "Screen Rant", "description": "Step inside the pitch meeting that led to Hawkeye!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6", "date": "Jan 11, 2022", "views": "973,601 views", "comments": "3,377", "likes": "63,572 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 439.301, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBfic_SIAoc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIFIZ5V_o2I": {"title": "Shang-Chi Pitch Meeting", "content creator": "Screen Rant", "description": "Step inside the pitch meeting that led to Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6", "date": "Premiered Sep 7, 2021", "views": "2,121,795 views", "comments": "5,252", "likes": "106,124 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 480.541, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIFIZ5V_o2I"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxTIBfvEWUY": {"title": "The Incredibles Pitch Meeting", "content creator": "Screen Rant", "description": "Step into the Pitch Meeting that started The Incredibles!

A religion that preaches about love, peace, and the equality of humankind, but also asks it\u2019s followers to carry swords.\n\nSikhism originated in the Punjab area of India and Pakistan, 500 years ago. The Punjab, the land of five rivers, is one of the most historically and culturally dense areas on Earth. Today there are about 25 million Sikhs. They make up about 2% of India's population but about 60% of the Punjab's. The Sikh diaspora is spread out across the world with concentrations in the UK, Canada, The US, East Africa, Australia, and Malaysia. Sikhs interestingly enough make up almost 1.5% of Canada's population which is second only to India.\n\nSo who are the Sikh\u2019s, what do they believe, and why does everyone confuse them for Muslims?

Austronesian languages replaced indigenous languages over nearly half the globe, yet the absolute number of Austronesian colonists was small. Recently, geneticists have identified large geographic disparities in the relative proportions of Asian ancestry across different genetic systems (NRY, mitochondrial DNA, autosomes and X chromosomes) in Austronesian-speaking societies of Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Surprisingly, a substantial genetic discontinuity occurs in the middle of a continuous chain of islands that form the southern arc of the Indonesian archipelago, near the geographic center of the Austronesian world. In the absence of geographic barriers to migration, this genetic boundary and swathe of Austronesian language replacement must have emerged from social behavior. Drawing on decades of comparative ethnological research inspired by F.A.E. van Wouden\u2019s structural model of Austronesian social organization, later codified by Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss as \"House societies\" (\"soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 maison\"), we propose a two-stage ethnographic model in which the appearance of matrilocal \u2018\u2018House societies\u2019\u2019 during the initial phase of the Austronesian expansion, and the subsequent disappearance of \u2018House societies\u2019\u2019 in lowland rice-growing regions, accounts for the observed linguistic, genetic and cultural patterns.\n\nPoint your browser to the following website to see other videos:", "date": "Jun 19, 2016", "views": "25,417 views", "comments": "145", "likes": "643 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 864.241, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvWDO4QSMuQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ska2fpueDLA": {"title": "How Aboriginal Australians Made Australia", "content creator": "Cogito", "description": "Didgeridoos, boomerangs, and an ancient hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

Check out the Intelligence Squared website to hear about future live events and podcasts: http://www.intelligencesquared.com \n__________________________\n\nFilmed at the Royal Geographical Society on 26th May 2015.\n\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks is one of the leading public intellectuals of our times. His book 'The Social Animal', a study of the unconscious mind and the triggers that drive human behaviour, was one of the most talked about publications of 2011. David Cameron instructed all the members of his Cabinet to read it.\n\nOn May 26th, Brooks came to the Intelligence Squared stage to share the insights of his latest book, 'The Road to Character'. Brooks argued that today\u2019s \u2018Big Me\u2019 culture is making us increasingly self-preoccupied: we live in a world where we\u2019re taught to be assertive, to master skills, to broadcast our brand, to get likes, to get followers. But amidst all the noise of self-promotion, Brooks claimed that we\u2019ve lost sight of an important and counterintuitive truth: that in order to fulfil ourselves we need to learn how to forget ourselves.\n\nTo make his case, Brooks distinguished two sorts of virtues: resum\u00e9 virtues and eulogy virtues. Resum\u00e9 virtues are the skills you bring to the marketplace: wealth, fame, status and a great career. Eulogy virtues are the things people will say about you at your funeral: that you were honest, loving, and steadfast. Most of us would say that eulogy virtues are more important, but it\u2019s the resum\u00e9 virtues we tend to think about the most.\n\nBy interweaving politics, spirituality and psychology, and citing examples from some of history\u2019s greatest thinkers and leaders \u2013 St. Augustine, Dwight Eisenhower and Samuel Johnson \u2013 Brooks showed that by cultivating the eulogy virtues we can create depth of character and restore balance to our lives.", "date": "Oct 20, 2015", "views": "89,227 views", "comments": "80", "likes": "1,058 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4906.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iGewxH3dgY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93hBty5x_rk": {"title": "An Islamic Case for Freedom and Tolerance: A Talk by Mustafa Akyol", "content creator": "Wofford College", "description": "Mustafa Akyol is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, where he focuses on the intersection of public policy, Islam and modernity.

Five years after his first Bitcoin documentary, award-winning producer/director Torsten Hoffmann revisits the topic and sets out to explore the evolution of the blockchain industry and its new lofty promises. Can this technology, designed to operate independent of trust and within a decentralized network, really provide a robust alternative to the Internet as we know it (web3.0)?\n\nCryptopia (2020)\nDirector: Torsten Hoffmann, Michael Watchulonis\nWriter: Torsten Hoffmann\nStars: Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Vitalik Buterin, Laura Shin, Roger Ver, Torsten Hoffmann\nGenre: Documentary\nCountry: Australia, United States, Germany\nLanguage: English, German\nAlso Known As: Cryptopia: Bitcoin, Blockchains and the Future of the Internet\nRelease Date: 14 January 2020 (Australia)\nDuration: 86 min\nFilming Locations: Australia, United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan, Hong Kong\n\nStoryline:\nBitcoin has been called one of the most disruptive technologies of our times, threatening banks by building an alternative and decentralized currency system. Some say that its \"blockchain\" could provide a blueprint for a better and fairer Internet - challenging the dominating technology giants. Despite this potential, Bitcoin is undergoing severe price volatility and the community is facing a bitter internal 'civil war'. Moreover, much of the media coverage is often misinformed or misleading and the general public is still confused about the technology and its larger implications. Join filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann (Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It) on his journey to better understand this decentralised technology and the promise of web3.0. This Screen Australia supported and crowdfunded feature documentary introduces the 'big brains and big egos' of this new industry including Andreas Antonopoulos, Laura Shin, Dr. Jemma Green, Charlie Lee, Vitalik Buterin, Preethi Kasireddy, Dr. Robert Kahn, Wences Casares, Samson Mow, Roger Ver, Craig Wright, and many more. Some of the hackers, hipsters and hustlers that Torsten interviewed 5 years ago are now creating a new decentralised web, while others have broken their promises. Can we trust them to build a trustless new cyber utopia or are their projects as unfairly distributed, and easily manipulated as our current systems?\n\nReviews:\n\"A very well balanced and easy to follow documentary that not only hears from the proponents of the space, but also its critics and controversial figures. The documentary opens the kimono to reveal many things newbies and even veterans in the space may have not known. A recommended watch for those curious about Bitcoin and its hardcore fan base.\" - Written by millioncents on IMDb.com\n\n\"I watched the first film in 2014 as a Bitcoin noob. This follow up does a great job explaining what happened over the last 6 years as well as getting newbies up to speed on Bitcoin/Blockchain without drowning them in the technicalities.\" - Written by darrenkis on IMDb.com\n\nQuote From The Producer:\n\"While my first film was low budget, talking-heads heavy and very academic, ", "date": "Premiered Dec 18, 2021", "views": "551,592 views", "comments": "733", "likes": "14,295 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5193.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5TqlnD1ZSI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzZWPcgcRD0": {"title": "Lee Sedol Hand of God Move 78 Reaction and Analysis", "content creator": "Fun Call Centre", "description": "The hand of God move from Lee Sedol in match 4 against AlphaGo.

Bryan Stevenson & Tim Keller will help us explore ways to sustain hope through a grace filled pursuit of justice and mercy as they draw from their own calling and work.\n\nBryan Stevenson is one of this nation\u2019s most influential public interest lawyers and the Founder & Director of the Equal Justice Initiative. For over 30 years, Stevenson has dedicated his life to help release those wrongly condemned on death row. He has also successfully advocated to eliminate the prosecution of children as adults. Leading the charge for a renewed conversation about racism in the US by connecting contemporary injustices with slavery, lynching, and segregation, Stevenson is the bestselling author of Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption.\n\n\nRev. Tim Keller has committed his life to presenting the gospel  - through preaching, teaching, and church planting - in ways that challenge not just our heads but our hearts to bring about lasting transformation. Co-founder and Senior Pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church for the last 27 years, Tim is also a prolific author. His many books have been translated into 26 languages.\n\nModerated by: Pamela Brown-Peterside is a long-time member of Redeemer\u2019s Grace & Race group and has been working at Redeemer for 8 years. She currently oversees a team that cares for 90 community groups that are part of our West Side congregation. Community groups meet throughout the week usually in people\u2019s apartments to worship, pray, study the Bible, and serve together. Before joining the Redeemer staff, Pamela worked in HIV/AIDS prevention with women in the South Bronx for almost a decade and saw firsthand the effects of poverty and mass incarceration in those communities of color.

After all, one doesn\u2019t become a best-selling author of more than 70 books and one of the world\u2019s most sought-after motivational speakers by not practicing what one preaches.\n\nTracy took the stage at Elite Academy in front of thousands July 21 to teach the 7 C\u2019s \u2014 seven powerful principles that make the difference between self-made millionaires and the rest of the world. While, in Tracy\u2019s own words, these principles are simple, few are the people who actually put them into practice. If we\u2019re able to, wealth and happiness await.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not complicated,\u201d said Tracy speaking of the 7 C\u2019s. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to learn rocket science. Anyone can become wealthy. But what\u2019s more important is the person you become while you\u2019re becoming wealthy. You have to become a completely different person. You have to develop character beyond 99% of the people in this world.

They moved the young and old alike and inspired the next generation of artists.\n\nIt is my hope that our venues, with the help of Congress and our communities, will be able to once again welcome their next act to the stage.\n\nI urge consideration and passage of this vital bill. In God we trust, I yield back.", "date": "Jul 30, 2020", "views": "228 views", "comments": "2", "likes": "7 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 62.001, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C8MhxGWe_I"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kTEEUX4r6E": {"title": "2021 Christmas Message", "content creator": "Roger Williams", "description": "", "date": "Dec 25, 2021", "views": "126 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\n#0 0x5571aa8d9a23 <unknown>\n#1 0x5571aa3a4e18 <unknown>\n#2 0x5571aa3db151 <unknown>\n#3 0x5571aa3db311 <unknown>\n#4 0x5571aa40dec4 <unknown>\n#5 0x5571aa3f89bd <unknown>\n#6 0x5571aa40bc5b <unknown>\n#7 0x5571aa3f8883 <unknown>\n#8 0x5571aa3ce3fa <unknown>\n#9 0x5571aa3cf4c5 <unknown>\n#10 0x5571aa90916d <unknown>\n#11 0x5571aa91f5bb <unknown>\n#12 0x5571aa90ae75 <unknown>\n#13 0x5571aa91fe85 <unknown>\n#14 0x5571aa8fe86f <unknown>\n#15 0x5571aa93aae8 <unknown>\n#16 0x5571aa93ac68 <unknown>\n#17 0x5571aa955aad <unknown>\n#18 0x7f05848d56db <unknown>\n", "likes": "8 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 31.541, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kTEEUX4r6E"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm13yHXDEKI": {"title": "Spectrum News: Help For Venues Could Be On The Way", "content creator": "Roger Williams", "description": "", "date": "Aug 8, 2020", "views": "45 views", "comments": "0", "likes": "1 like", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 52.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm13yHXDEKI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rb_B9DtkJc": {"title": "'Nobody In This Country Is Buying The Fake Hysteria': McConnell Goes Off On Democrats' Voting Claims", "content creator": "Forbes Breaking News", "description": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) slammed Democrats' claims about voter suppression.\n\nStay Connected\nForbes on Facebook: ", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "113,883 views", "comments": "1,370", "likes": "4,002 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 642.941, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rb_B9DtkJc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlONwxT9Nlc": {"title": "What Was The Indus Valley Civilisation?", "content creator": "Cogito", "description": "Sign up for an annual CuriosityStream subscription and you'll also get free access to Nebula (a new streaming platform I'm helping to build along with other creators).

Going as far as to sweep the floor as they walk to avoid stepping on lifeforms, covering their mouths as to not swallow or breath hot air on living creatures, and following a strict vegetarian diet that not only bans all meat, fish, and eggs but also potatoes!!! So what is Jainism and why is it considered the world\u2019s most peaceful religion. \n\nTheir ancient philosophy has garnered the eye of the modern world as their ideas of non-violence, strict vegetarianism, and what could be called an environmentalist outlook are strikingly relevant.\n\nJains have been highly influential in India for thousands of years. Shaping it's vegetarian-friendly diet and lending the concept of Ahimsa to Gandhi's independence movement. \n\n\nA Jain is someone who accepts the teachings of the Tirthankaras. 'Jainism' comes from the word \u201cJina\u201d.\n\nTirthankaras are the most important people in Jainism. They have removed all their attachments to the world and during their lifetimes they managed to break free from the cycle of rebirth and death that Jains believe keeps souls trapped on Earth.\n\nFollow me on twitter", "date": "Aug 31, 2019", "views": "866,268 views", "comments": "4,780", "likes": "27,274 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1125.681, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkwmYlgkOhU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-rGqnPVxI4": {"title": "You Don\u2019t Know Your Mom Is Crazy Until You\u2019re Older.

You can get any minor yo want with your degree. The closer the minor is to your degree, the easier it will be to complete the minor. For example, if you are a physics major, you will have to take a lot of math courses as part of your degree program. Since some of the math courses for a physics major overlap with math minor requirements, it would be a lot easier to complete a math minor as a physics major than completing a biology minor. However, you need not take on a minor that is closely related to your major requirements. Do whatever you think is best for you!\n\nYou may find this video particularly helpful if you are a freshman or if you are not familiar with degree minors in the US university system.

As the surrounding populations of Europe have shifted over the ages again and again, the Basque people remain.\n\nKnown today by its inhabitants as Euskadi, Pa\u00eds Vasco, or Euskal Herria, the Basque Country has become a region famous for its cuisine and wine of ancient grapes such as Tempranillo, of traditional fishing villages and picturesque cities. Tourism has replaced much of history\u2019s strife. But defining Euskal Herria is as difficult as defining the word Herria itself. In Euskara its root herri can mean everything from village to population to nation. Euskal Herria is the collective identity of this ancient people.\n\nBasque Country has historically comprised of settlements located along the western edge of the Pyrenees, currently organized in seven provinces: Gipuzkoa; Bizkaia; Araba; and Nafarroa on the southern side of the Pyrenees and Zuberoa; Lapurdi; and Nafarroa Beherea on the northern side. Euskara has five main dialects, a non-Indo-European language isolate with no close relationship to any other extant language. Overall, Euskara is spoken by nearly thirty percent, or three-quarters of a million Basques. The vast majority are in the Spanish region. Only seven percent are in the French portion. The French dialects are Navarrese\u2013 Lapurdian and Souletin, and the Spanish dialects are Upper Navarrese, Biscayan, and Gipuzkoan. These dialects are sometimes mutually incomprehensible, especially in the case of Souletin. Studies suggest that these dialects branched from a unified Basque language sometime during the Middle Ages and developed according to geographical, cultural, political, and administrative reasons. Although structurally unlike any Indo European language, the official Euskara Batua today contains many loan words from Romance languages --up to 40% of its vocabulary, and a modified Latin script.\n\nThe mystery of Euskara\u2019s long linguistic isolation has led to many theories of its origins and possible related languages. Most of these hypotheses are very tenuous, such as Basque-Iberic comparisons based on fragments of extinct variations of Vasconic, Auquitanian, and Iberian tongues, or they are based on coincidence and pseudoscientific speculation, ranging from the popular assertion that the Basques are descended from Old Testament patriarchs to the folk beliefs that Basques are related to the distant Kartvelian populations of Caucasus Georgia to a slightly more plausible relation to the ancient Chechen language, neighbors of the Georgians whose language structure appears closer to Euskara. These models of Den\u00e9-Caucasian language families might mean that the Basque and their ancestors originated from the Caucasus. But only the latest genetic studies of modern Basque samples have reached clear conclusions.\n\n\nVideo Attribution:\n\nMiguel Angel Z\u00e1lez\nDolmen de Arrizala o Sorginetxe (Agurain-Salvatierra). \u00c1lava..mp4", "date": "Apr 17, 2021", "views": "696,704 views", "comments": "2,379", "likes": "15,969 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1845.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un1QtE5swEU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX8cz1LEeXw&list=RDCMUCKMnl27hDMKvch--noWe5CA&start_radio=1&rv=mX8cz1LEeXw": {"title": "What Is Shinto?", "content creator": "Cogito", "description": "Sign up for an annual Curiositystream subscription with 41% off and you'll also get free access to Nebula (a new streaming platform I'm helping to build along with other creators). https://curiositystream.com/cogito", "date": "Sep 23, 2021", "views": "241,606 views", "comments": "967", "likes": "11,036 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1361.701, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX8cz1LEeXw&list=RDCMUCKMnl27hDMKvch--noWe5CA&start_radio=1&rv=mX8cz1LEeXw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcvDV5-x6Fk": {"title": "Shinto Shrines for kids \u2013 an amazing and quick guide to Shinto Shrines", "content creator": "Learning Tail", "description": "Join us today as we travel to see Shinto Shrines in Japan!

An Apocalyptic vision containing earthquakes, plagues, and a few of multi-eyed 'Bible Accurate Angels' for good measure. The Biblical Apocalypse may be something you've heard of, but may not know what is supposed to take place. For example, where does the number 666 come from? and what is Armageddon?\n\nIf you're looking to learn more about the biblical apocalypse, then you're in the right place. I have crafted together this handy introductory video taking a secular-minded overview of the Book of Revelation. Now, although I have entitled this video as a survival guide, actual survival tips may be lacking. That said, knowing what to expect may help in an actual apocalypse. Or not...\n\nAfter a bit of a pause in my upload schedule to finish of university work, I'm glad to say that I've graduated! Thank you all for your patience, more videos on the way.

This event took place on August 17, 2011, as part of the Authors@Google series.\n\nKevin Mitnick was the most elusive computer break-in artist in history. He accessed computers and networks at the world's biggest companies--and however fast the authorities were, Mitnick was faster, sprinting through phone switches, computer systems, and cellular networks. He spent years skipping through cyberspace, always three steps ahead and labeled unstoppable. But for Kevin, hacking wasn't just about technological feats-it was an old fashioned confidence game that required guile and deception to trick the unwitting out of valuable information.\n\nDriven by a powerful urge to accomplish the impossible, Mitnick bypassed security systems and blazed into major organizations including Motorola, Sun Microsystems, and Pacific Bell. But as the FBI's net began to tighten, Kevin went on the run, engaging in an increasingly sophisticated cat and mouse game that led through false identities, a host of cities, plenty of close shaves, and an ultimate showdown with the Feds, who would stop at nothing to bring him down. \n\nGhost in the Wires is a thrilling true story of intrigue, suspense, and unbelievable escape, and a portrait of a visionary whose creativity, skills, and persistence forced the authorities to rethink the way they pursued him, inspiring ripples that brought permanent changes in the way people and companies protect their most sensitive information.", "date": "Sep 12, 2011", "views": "177,321 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\n#0 0x55b663a78a23 <unknown>\n#1 0x55b663543e18 <unknown>\n#2 0x55b66357a151 <unknown>\n#3 0x55b66357a311 <unknown>\n#4 0x55b6635acec4 <unknown>\n#5 0x55b6635979bd <unknown>\n#6 0x55b6635aac5b <unknown>\n#7 0x55b663597883 <unknown>\n#8 0x55b66356d3fa <unknown>\n#9 0x55b66356e4c5 <unknown>\n#10 0x55b663aa816d <unknown>\n#11 0x55b663abe5bb <unknown>\n#12 0x55b663aa9e75 <unknown>\n#13 0x55b663abee85 <unknown>\n#14 0x55b663a9d86f <unknown>\n#15 0x55b663ad9ae8 <unknown>\n#16 0x55b663ad9c68 <unknown>\n#17 0x55b663af4aad <unknown>\n#18 0x7f4497f046db <unknown>\n", "likes": "2,429 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3131.881, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUqes9QdLQ4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWpyhsPAK14": {"title": "6.

How did we get here? How did the first living organism come about? Can it have happened spontaneously? Isn't life way too complex for that to happen? It seems ridiculous, right? Well, no. Not if you understand biochemistry, which creationists do not. But every once in a while, a hero emerges from academia to champion the cause of the creationist, and lend some illusory credence to their views. In this case, that hero is James Tour, a synthetic organic chemist who insists that abiogenesis is impossible, and he should know better than anyone, because he's a chemist. I was made aware of Dr. Tour after a couple hundred people linked me to a video of his in an empty argument from authority, insisting that because a chemist confirms their religious bias, they must be right. But is Dr. Tour a bit biased himself? Let's find out precisely what his agenda is, shall we?\n\nUpdate: James Tour responded to this single video with a dumpster fire of a 14-part series overflowing with stupidity and lies, which qualifies for the Dunning-Kruger Hall of Fame.

The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation.\n\nI also discuss \"task bracketing\" as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). I also review the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits. \n\nThe science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more\u2014indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.", "date": "Jan 3, 2022", "views": "442,301 views", "comments": "883", "likes": "14,939 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6638.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoREwgeE0sA": {"title": "Oversimplified Punished Severely", "content creator": "Dan the Cat", "description": "Note: I didn't make any of this Oversimplified did.

Here, he reacts to seven memorable scenes featuring medieval weapons and armor and rates them based on their historical accuracy. \n\nCapwell looks at armor and weapons within fantasy franchises, such as Eomer's helmet in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" (2002).  Using artifacts from The Wallace Collection, Capwell addresses the realism of knightly combat in \"Henry V\" (1944), \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" (2005) and \"Game of Thrones\" (2011). Does chain mail look anything like it does in Netflix's \"Outlaw King\" (2018)?

He has been a horseman and martial artist since childhood, is a founding member of the modern historical jousting community, and has fought in major international tournaments all over the world.

In essence, once China grew wealthy, a US-China cold war was inevitable. Had US policymakers understood this logic in the early 1990s, they would have tried to slow down Chinese growth and maximise the power gap between Beijing and Washington.\n\nHowever, the US did the opposite: it pursued a policy of engagement, which aimed to help China grow wealthier \u2013 based on the assumption that China would become a democracy and a responsible stakeholder, which would lead to a more peaceful world. Instead of fostering harmonious relations between China and the US, engagement led to an intense rivalry.\n\nIs Australia and the world in deep trouble? Absent a major internal Chinese crisis, Washington and Beijing are consigned to waging a dangerous security competition. Can we manage on the margins to prevent disaster?\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is professor of political science and international relations at the University of Chicago and author of The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001). He was a guest at the Centre for Independent Studies in 2019. \n\nHost: Tom Switzer is executive director of the Centre for Independent Studies. \n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nCIS promotes free choice and individual liberty and the open exchange of ideas.

Not only has he seen amazing places, his work has also taught him respect for the environment and others, has given him an unprecedented drive for improvement, and has kept him humble on those \u2018high gravity' days.\n\nThe ability to meet new people all over the globe, to be close to the elements, and to share and inspire keeps him moving and fascinates him. It has resulted in a free, mindful, and engaged lifestyle. But not only does he live on the edge himself, as a graduate in Applied Sports & High Performance Psychology he coaches other professional athletes to provide them with the mental edge and skills necessary to achieve their extreme goals and unleash their full potential. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

He revisited the main themes of his Prayer Breakfast address in his lecture at the Church of St. Gregory the Great on April 7, 2015.  The lecture, \u201cDo Not Be Ashamed of the Gospel:  Bearing Moral Witness in the Public Square\u201d explored the relationship between the obligation to bear moral witness and the concepts of Christian discipleship and the universal call to holiness.\n\nRobert P.

So why has Cambridge University taken to warning its students that the sexual violence in Titus Andronicus might be traumatic for them? Why are other universities in America and increasingly in Britain introducing measures to protect students from speech and texts they might find harmful? Safe spaces, trigger warnings and no-platforming are now campus buzzwords \u2013 and they\u2019re all designed to limit free speech and the exchange of ideas. As celebrated social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues in his book 'The Coddling of the American Mind', university students are increasingly retreating from ideas they fear may damage their mental health, and presenting themselves as fragile and in need of protection from any viewpoint that might make them feel unsafe.The culture of safety, as Haidt calls it, may be well intentioned, but it is hampering the development of young people and leaving them unprepared for adult life, with devastating consequences for them, for the companies that will soon hire them, and for society at large.\n\nThat, Haidt\u2019s critics argue, is an infuriating misinterpretation of initiatives designed to help students. Far from wanting to shut down free speech and debate, what really concerns the advocates of these new measures is the equal right to speech in a public forum where the voices of the historically marginalised are given the same weight as those of more privileged groups. Warnings to students that what they\u2019re about to read or hear might be disturbing are not an attempt to censor classic literature, but a call for consideration and sensitivity. Safe spaces aren\u2019t cotton-wool wrapped echo chambers, but places where minority groups and people who have suffered trauma can share their experiences without fear of hostility.\n\nIn November 2018, Haidt came to the Intelligence Squared stage to discuss and debate these ideas. Joining him were the former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who believes that educating young people through debate and argument helps foster robustness, author and activist Eleanor Penny, and sociologist Kehinde Andrews, one of the UK\u2019s leading thinkers on race and the history of racism.", "date": "Mar 28, 2019", "views": "515,276 views", "comments": "6,011", "likes": "7,336 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5112.181, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpGd5DZ_K5w"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGTS9vZFV2o": {"title": "The Coddling of the American Mind moderated by Malcolm Gladwell", "content creator": "92nd Street Y", "description": "Civil discourse is in decline, with potentially dire results for American democracy.\n\nOn college campuses across America, visiting speakers are disinvited, or even shouted down, while professors, students, and administrators are afraid to talk openly, for fear that someone will take offense.

On the Intelligence Squared stage, we have Will Self arguing for Brave New World and Adam Gopnik arguing for Nineteen Eighty-Four. The debate was chaired by Jonathan Freedland.\n\nDystopian books and films are in the zeitgeist. Reflecting the often dark mood of our times, Intelligence Squared are staging a contest between two of the greatest dystopian novels, 'Brave New World' and 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'. Each book captured the nightmares of the 1930s and 40s. But which vision looks more prescient to us now in the 21st century? Are we living in George Orwell\u2019s sinister surveillance state? Or in Aldous Huxley\u2019s vapid consumerist culture? To battle it out, we brought two celebrated writers, Adam Gopnik and Will Self, to our stage.\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected, it seemed as if 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' had clinched it. The book shot to the top of the bestseller charts. It felt so ominously familiar. In Orwell\u2019s dystopia, the corporate state controls the news, insisting that \u2018whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth\u2019. That sounds very like Trump\u2019s \u2018alternative facts\u2019, and the war he is waging on the \u2018fake news\u2019 media. Orwell imagined two-way telescreens spying on every citizen\u2019s home. Today we have Amazon\u2019s \u2018always listening\u2019 Alexa device, while Google, Facebook and the security agencies hoover up our personal data for their own ends. Orwell also described an Inner Party \u2013 two percent of the population \u2013 enjoying all the privileges and political control. Isn\u2019t that scarily close to the \u2018one percent\u2019, reviled for their wealth and influence by anti-capitalists today? No wonder everyone rushed out to buy the book.\n\nBut Orwell\u2019s critics say 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' is a dated dystopia, a vision that died along with communism. The novel that better resonates with our present, they say, is 'Brave New World'. Here Aldous Huxley imagined a plastic techno-society where sex is casual, entertainment light and consumerism rampant. There are pills to make people happy, virtual reality shows to distract the masses from actual reality, and hook-ups to take the place of love and commitment. Isn\u2019t that all a bit close to home? Huxley even imagined a caste system created by genetic engineering, from alpha and beta types right down to a slave underclass. We may not have gone down that road, but gene-editing might soon enable Silicon Valley\u2019s super-rich to extend their lifespans and enhance the looks and intelligence of their offspring. Will we soon witness the birth of a new genetic super-class?\n\nBoth these novels imagined extraordinary futures, but which better captures our present and offers the keener warning about where we may be heading?\n\n__________________________\n\nBrilliant minds, debate, online events, ask your questions.

In this series we bring together speakers from a vast array of disciples--from philosophy and law to biology and psychology--to discuss cutting edge research in the cognitive science of morality.

Dr. Haidt's research these days focuses on the moral foundations of politics, and on ways to transcend the \"culture wars\" by using recent discoveries in moral psychology to foster more civil forms of politics.

Many of you have asked me for my recommendation on one topic to learn in order to pick up advanced physics concepts more easily - and this is it!\n\nI wanted to discuss how particular properties of matrices correspond directly to particular requirements of physics theories. This is, of course, in part because those theories were formalized using matrices in the first place... but not always.\n\nFor example, those of you familiar with matrix multiplication will know that this process is not commutative - the order in which you multiply two matrices together actually matters. If we want to multiply matrices A and B, then the product AB is not necessarily the same as BA. This is known as the non-commutativity of matrix multiplication. \n\nThis non-commutative property is perfect for representing measurement operators in quantum mechanics! When we make multiple measurements on a quantum system, the order in which we make these measurements actually matters. For example, measuring the position and then the momentum of an electron can give us different results to measuring the momentum first and then the position. Measurements in quantum mechanics are mathematically represented by \"measurement operators\" (discussed here: ", "date": "Dec 8, 2020", "views": "28,753 views", "comments": "136", "likes": "2,418 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 481.741, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ujvy2-o1I9c"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGtMta8vpbg": {"title": "Before and After: Buildings Reinvented", "content creator": "The B1M", "description": "In an effort to retain heritage, reduce waste and overcome the challenge of finding sites in urban areas, architects, engineers and developers are breathing new life into existing structures and the communities around them.

You will see how the core ideas of the FFT can be \"discovered\" through asking the right questions. The key insights that are presented in this video is that polynomial multiplication can be improved significantly by multiplying polynomials in a special value representation. The challenge that presents itself is the problem of converting a polynomial from a standard coefficient representation to value representation. \n\nWe see that the FFT is an incredibly efficient recursive algorithm that performs this task, and we also discover that a slightly tweaked FFT (Inverse FFT) can also solve the reverse problem of interpolation.

Under Henry VIII, England broke away from the Catholic Church in Europe and the authority of the Pope. The 1534 Act of Supremacy, made the reigning monarch the Head of the Church in England. Europe was also facing a split within the Christian Church. Many people began to question the Catholic Church and the Pope's authority. A German monk called Martin Luther founded a new church for people who opposed Catholicism. Followers of Luther's new church became known as Protestants. This was the start of the Reformation. Whilst Henry remained a Catholic until his death, his son Edward VI was raised a Protestant. Under Edward, England became Protestant for the first time, however Edward died young and his successor Mary I, was Catholic. Mary began a process of counter reformation and returned England to the Catholic Church. However, Mary's reign was also short lived, she died in 1558 and was replaced by Elizabeth I. Elizabeth was a Protestant and restored Protestantism. England has been a Protestant country ever since.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please like and subscribe.\n\nThanks for watching", "date": "Jul 28, 2021", "views": "475 views", "comments": "0", "likes": "10 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 242.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0LVjj5XjQs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yze1YAz_LYM": {"title": "Dan Britt - Orbits and Ice Ages: The History of Climate", "content creator": "TheIHMC", "description": "Another lecture in IHMC's award winning lecture series. http://www.ihmc.us\n\nClimate change has become a major political issue, but few understand how climate has changed in the past and the forces that drive climate. Most people don't know that fifty million years ago there were breadfruit trees and crocodiles on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, or that 18,000 years ago there was a mile-thick glacier on Manhattan and a continuous belt of winter sea ice extending south to Cape Hatteras. The History of Climate provides context of our current climate debate and fundamental insight how the climate works.\n\nDr. Daniel Britt is a Professor of Astronomy and Planetary Sciences at the Department of Physics, University of Central Florida. He was educated at the University of Washington and Brown University, receiving a Ph.D. from Brown in 1991. He has had a varied career including service in the US Air Force as an ICBM missile launch officer and an economist for Boeing before going into planetary sciences. He has served on the science teams of two NASA missions, Mars Pathfinder and Deep Space 1. He was the project manager for the camera on Mars Pathfinder and has built hardware for all the NASA Mars landers.\n\nBritt currently does research on the physical properties and mineralogy of asteroids, comets, the Moon, and Mars under several NASA grants. Honors include 5 NASA Achievement Awards, election as a Fellow of the Meteoritical Society, and an asteroid named after him; 4395 Dan Britt. He is currently President of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society. He lives in Orlando with his wife Judith.

Our guest on this topic is Dr. James Kirkland, a geriatrics specialist and researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who is known for his research into the role that senescence and senescent cells have on age-related dysfunction and chronic disease.\n\nAs senescent cells build up in the body, they promote cellular aging and a host of chronic conditions related to aging, such as dementia, cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes and arthritis. In today\u2019s interview, we focus on Jim\u2019s 2015 study where he and his colleagues at Mayo were the first to report on the potential of senolytic drugs to selectively kill zombie senescent cells. Jim\u2019s paper in Aging Cell has been hailed as a major breakthrough in aging research.\n\nJim is the director of the Robert and Arlene Kogod Center of Aging at Mayo and the president of the American Federation for Aging Research. The goal of James\u2019 lab and research is to develop methods to remove senescent cells to delay, prevent, alleviate or partially reverse age-related chronic diseases.  Jim and his colleagues believe that doing this will help extend people\u2019s health span, and, more important, prolong the period of life where people can live free of disabilities caused by chronic disease.", "date": "May 7, 2021", "views": "3,313 views", "comments": "13", "likes": "112 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3337.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ursqm6shxQs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wKOVZKimwg": {"title": "Dating the Ice Age Floods", "content creator": "Central Washington University", "description": "CWU's Nick Zentner presents 'Dating the Ice Age Floods' - the 22nd talk in his ongoing Downtown Geology Lecture Series.

In this talk, we will demonstrate the use of Stan for some small problems in sports ranking, nonlinear regression, mixture modeling, and decision analysis, to illustrate the general idea that Bayesian data analysis involves model building, model fitting, and model checking. One of our major motivations in building Stan is to efficiently fit complex models to data, and Stan has indeed been used for this purpose in social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, and business. The purpose of the present webinar is to demonstrate using simple examples how one can directly specify and fit models in Stan and make logical decisions under uncertainty.\n\nAndrew Gelman is a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University.

(2) The myth that the Great Depression was caused by a failure of business. It was, in fact, produced by a failure of government and specifically by the Federal Reserve System. (3) The myth that government in the economy has expanded in response to public demand. Actually, the public has had to be sold \u201chard\u201d for politicians to enact every major social program. (4) The \u201cfree lunch\u201d myth. No matter how the government raises money\u2014by taxing individuals, by taxing businesses, or by printing more money\u2014it is the individual who pays. (5) The myth that government, like Robin Hood, transfers wealth from the rich to the poor. The reality is that the government usually transfers wealth and income from both the very rich and the very poor to those in the middle. Delivered at Utah State University, Logan, Utah.

Featuring Thomas Sowell.\n\nShared for historical purposes. I do not own the rights.\n_____\n\nMilton Friedman (/\u02c8fri\u02d0dm\u0259n/; July 31, 1912 \u2013 November 16, 2006) was an American economist who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy.[4] With George Stigler and others, Friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the second generation of Chicago school of economics, a methodological movement at the University of Chicago's Department of Economics, Law School and Graduate School of Business from the 1940s onward. Several students and young professors who were recruited or mentored by Friedman at Chicago went on to become leading economists, including Gary Becker, Robert Fogel, Thomas Sowell[5] and Robert Lucas Jr.[6]\nFriedman's challenges to what he later called \"naive Keynesian\" theory[7] began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function. In the 1960s, he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies[8] and described his approach (along with mainstream economics) as using \"Keynesian language and apparatus\" yet rejecting its \"initial\" conclusions.[9] He theorized that there existed a \"natural\" rate of unemployment and argued that unemployment below this rate would cause inflation to accelerate.[10] He argued that the Phillips curve was in the long run vertical at the \"natural rate\" and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation.[11] Friedman promoted an alternative macroeconomic viewpoint known as \"monetarism\" and argued that a steady, small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy.[12] His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s. His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve's response to the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008.[13]\nFriedman was an advisor to Republican President Ronald Reagan[3] and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[2] His political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax and school vouchers[14] and opposed the war on drugs. His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice. - wikipedia\n\n#####\nReelblack's mission is to educate, elevate, entertain, enlighten, and empower through Black film.
