The real story begins much earlier, in December, 1932.  In the bathroom of a Belgian hotel, a French spymaster photographs secret documents \u2013 operating instructions of a new cipher machine, Enigma. A few weeks later a mathematician in Warsaw begins to decipher the coded communications of the Third Reich and lay the foundations for the famous operation at Bletchley Park. In this illustrated talk Dermot Turing explains the international alliance which set the Bletchley Park codebreakers on the path to the British Bombe, as seen at The National Museum of Computing.\n\nDermot Turing is the acclaimed author of Prof: Alan Turing Decoded, a biography of his famous uncle, The Story of Computing, and most recently the award-winning X, Y and Z \u2013 the real story of how Enigma was broken. His new book, a reappraisal of Alan Turing\u2019s legacy, Reflections of Alan Turing, is published on 22 April He began writing in 2014 after a career in law. Dermot worked for the Government Legal Service and then the international law firm Clifford Chance, where he was a partner until 2014. He is a Visiting Fellow at Kellogg College, Oxford.\n\nThis Illustrated talk last approximately 40 minutes, followed by a 20 minute Q&A session.\n\nRecorded 7th April 2021.", "date": "Jun 1, 2021", "views": "355,876 views", "comments": "759", "likes": "5,130 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4069.541, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn_BBQEjCxI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3a_JIr1Awc": {"title": "Battlefield 2042 Is So Deserted & Busted Even Cheat Makers & Sellers Are Abandoning The Game", "content creator": "YongYea", "description": "SURPRISE MECHANICS (MERCH): http://www.yongyea.com\nPATREON: http://www.patreon.com/yongyea\nTWITTER: http://www.twitter.com/yongyea", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "278,505 views", "comments": "2,627", "likes": "15,664 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 789.941, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3a_JIr1Awc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22nXuJ0_56o": {"title": "Our financial bubble is going to burst.", "content creator": "Peter Schiff", "description": "Peter Schiff discusses whether the current inflation will turn into hyperinflation and how to protect your savings and investments.

Within this documentary, we explored how an event like the Toronto van attack could happen in Canada and how Canadians are trying to heal from it. More broadly, we looked at misogyny and violence against women within Canada, and what it is about contemporary feminism that makes some men angry or lost. We also paid attention to men suffering from violence that their female partners had inflicted upon them. As prominent Canadian voices, we included both Margaret Atwood and Jordan Peterson.\n\nPsychology professor Jordan Peterson has become a controversial figure ever since speaking out against Bill C-16 (2016), a law which adds gender expression and gender identity to the Canadian Human Rights Act. He has received both praise and criticism after the publication of his self-help book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018). His fans are thankful for the advice he\u2019s given them to take responsibility for their lives, his critics argue that his emphasis on the danger posed by \u2018postmodern neo-marxists\u2019 is dangerous in itself. He has been accused of being anti-feminist and feeding into the alt-right. While he gained support among people who do identify with the alt-right, he himself does not. \n\nPeterson has become an important inspiration for various men\u2019s groups, an influential voice. Therefore, we wanted to get clear where he stands on contemporary feminism and how he interprets the van attack, which took place in the city he lives in. Since the documentary episode only allowed for brief passages from the interview, while Peterson\u2019s answers are extensive, we decided to provide the entire interview.\n\nWe talked to Peterson on the 4th of June 2019, in Toronto, Ontario. Since there were some breaks (for adjusting the camera and for having coffee) during the interview, it consists of multiple takes. Apart from leaving out the breaks themselves and making the transition between breaks more fluent, no further editing has been done. \n\nThe documentary about the Toronto van attack and male-female dynamics in Canada is available here: ", "date": "Sep 15, 2020", "views": "1,786,499 views", "comments": "10,282", "likes": "40,827 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 7913.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ruwVc0t2c0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPqWstVnRjQ": {"title": "Joe Rogan Experience #1035 - Paul Stamets", "content creator": "PowerfulJRE", "description": "Paul Stamets is a mycologist, author and advocate of bioremediation and medicinal fungi.

Being from Mississippi, I don\u2019t get the chance to eat it very often, but when a friend offered some from a recent harvest; I jumped on the chance.\n\nFor this recipe I wanted to savor the taste of the elk, so I kept the seasoning to a minimum.  Coarse Salt and Black Pepper are all that\u2019s needed. I\u2019m also using a cast iron skillet over hot coals to sear the outside, leaving it rare to medium rare in the center. This process works for any type of steak, so feel free to try it with beef as well.\n\nI have my weber kettle fired up for this cook with my Santa Maria attachment from Gabby Grills.  It gives me the ability to raise and lower the grate over the coals which makes regulating the temperature very easy.\n\nFirst we need to season each elk steak with salt and black pepper.  When the coals are good and hot, place an iron skillet directly on the grill grate and let the skillet heat up a bit.  This shouldn\u2019t take long at all, only 2-3 minutes if you your coals are burning properly.\n\nAdd a tablespoon of butter to the skillet and let it melt.  Place one of the steaks in the center of the skillet and let it sear for 2 minutes.  At this point add a few cloves of garlic, a sprig of fresh rosemary, and an additional tablespoon of butter to the skillet.  Now it\u2019s starting to smell really good!\n\nAfter 2 minutes flip the elk steak over, and begin basting it with the butter mixture left in the pan.  It needs about 2 more minutes to cook to medium rare which is where I like it. At this point remove the steak from the grill and let it rest while repeat the process for the next steak.  Be sure to wipe out the skillet between each cook and give it a few minutes to get hot before adding the next steak.  \n\nYou also want to rest each one for 5-7 minutes to let the juices redistribute throughout the meat or you\u2019ll lose all that delicious flavor when you cut into it.  \n\nElk Steak Ingredients:\n- 2 Elk Steaks 10-12oz ea\n- 1 Tablespoon Kosher Salt\n- 1 Tablespoon Ground Black Pepper\n- 4 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter\n- 6 Cloves Garlic\n- 2 Sprigs Fresh Rosemary\n\nElk Steak Directions:\n1. Prepare charcoal grill for direct cooking over Lump charcoal.\n2. Season each elk steak with salt and black pepper on both sides.\n3. Place cast iron skillet on grill grate directly over hot coals.\n4. Add 1 Tablespoon of butter to iron skillet and allow to melt.\n5. Place one of the elk steaks in the iron skillet and sear for 2 minutes.  Add  2-3 cloves of garlic and 1 sprig of rosemary to the skillet along with 1 additional Tablespoon of butter.\n6. Flip the steak and cook for 2 minutes, baste the top with the butter mixture as it cooks.\n7. Remove the elk steak from the skillet for medium rare or continue to cook until desired doneness is reached.\n8. Wipe the skillet out with paper towel and repeat the above process for the remaining steak.\n9. Rest each steak for 5-7 minutes before serving.\n\nFor more barbecue and grilling recipes visit: ", "date": "Oct 18, 2018", "views": "226,821 views", "comments": "353", "likes": "4,398 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 376.901, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7UNaKD0UY4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB08m-d1hhc": {"title": "Star Trek The Next Generation Retrospective/Review - Star Trek Retrospective, Part 8", "content creator": "Rowan J Coleman", "description": "Star Trek Retrospective, Part 8: As the Star Trek franchise continued its successful run of movies, higher ups at Paramount considered a new Star Trek show for the small screen.

A mountain of misinformation, speculation, and rushing to judgements, already exist that throw John F.

Quick-buck artists come and go with every bull market. The steady players make it through the bear markets. You\u2019re a part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don\u2019t sell that out.\u201d\n\nB. Fox: \u201cI never knew how poor I was until I started making money.\u201d\n\nGekko: \u201cWhat\u2019s worth doing is worth doing for money.\u201d\n\nGekko: \u201cA fool and his money are lucky to even meet.\u201d\n\nB. Fox: \u201cHow many yachts can you water-ski behind? How much is enough?\u201d\nGekko: \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of enough, pal. It\u2019s a zero-sum game. Somebody wins, somebody loses. Money itself isn\u2019t lost or made, it\u2019s simply transferred from one perception to another, like magic. This painting here. I bought it ten years ago for $60,000. I could sell it today for six hundred. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperate they want it. Capitalism at its finest.\u201d\nB. Fox: \u201cHow much is enough, Gordon?\u201d\nGekko: \u201cThe richest 1% of this country owns half our country\u2019s wealth. Five trillion dollars. One third comes from hard work, two thirds from inheritance, interest on interest accumulating to widows and idiot sons\u2026 and what I do: stock and real-estate speculation. It\u2019s bullshit. You got 90% of the American public with little or no net worth. I create nothing. I own. We make the rules, pal. The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval, the price of a paperclip. We pick that rabbit out of the hat while everybody wonders how the hell we did it. You\u2019re not naive enough to think we\u2019re living in a democracy, are you, Buddy? It\u2019s the free market, and you\u2019re part of it.\u201d\n\nMannheim: \u201cThe main thing about money, Bud, is it makes you do things you don\u2019t wanna do.\u201d\n\nC. Fox: \u201cStop going for the easy buck and produce something with your life. Create, instead of living off the buying and selling of others.\u201d\n\nCharacters: Lou Mannheim (jaded, old broker, played by Hal Holbrook), Bud Fox (aspiring young broker, played by Charlie Sheen), Gordon Gekko (greedy, successful trader, played by Michael Douglas), Carl Fox (Bud\u2019s father, an airline mechanic union rep, played by Martin Sheen (Charlie Sheen\u2019s real father)).", "date": "Mar 12, 2019", "views": "150,961 views", "comments": "271", "likes": "1,553 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 199.861, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqjQxs9l5fg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-7HA9_qmdg": {"title": "Credit default swaps and collaterized debt obligations", "content creator": "MyFinanceTeacher", "description": "A nice clip from \"The Big Short\" on CDS and CDO.", "date": "May 1, 2016", "views": "108,485 views", "comments": "55", "likes": "563 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 122.881, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-7HA9_qmdg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVbgkX3gspw": {"title": "THE BIG SHORT - BEST SCENE, SHORTS TURN THE TABLES ON WALL STREET \ud83c\udfac", "content creator": "UKspreadbetting", "description": "\u2705 Trade with our Sponsor Broker: TradeNation http://www.financial-spread-betting.c...\n\ud83d\udcde Join Mark's TradersMastermind: https://www.tradersmastermind.com/mas...\n\u2705 Check Mark's Premium Course: https://price-action-trading.teachabl...", "date": "May 18, 2021", "views": "1,611,866 views", "comments": "663", "likes": "10,017 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 372.501, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVbgkX3gspw"}}
