In consequence, this lecture concentrates almost exclusively on psychology: How is an encounter with the unknown to be understood, conceptually? How and why is that represented with themes such as the underworld voyage, the dragon fight, or the flood? \n\nAll that constitutes the theme of lecture VI.\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

There was more to be said about the idea of God as creator (with the Word as the process underlying the act of creation). I didn't mind, because it is very important to get God and the Creation of the Universe right before moving on  :)  .\n\nIn this lecture, I tried to outline something like this: for anything to be, there has to be a substrate (call it a potential) from which it emerges, a structure that provides the possibility of imposing order on that substrate, and the act of ordering, itself. So the first is something like the precosmogonic chaos (implicitly feminine); the second, God the Father; the third, what the Christian West has portrayed as the Son (the Word of Truth). \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

They are corrected here.\n\nLife at the individual and the societal level is punctuated by crisis and catastrophe. This stark truth finds its narrative representation in the widely-distributed universal motif of the flood. Mircea Eliade, the great Romanian historian of religion, noted that flood stories identify two reasons for the destruction: (1) the tendency of complex things to fall apart of their own accord; (2) the proclivity of human beings to speed up that process by sinning, or missing the mark (by engaging in self-evident corruption, or by failing to attend to what cries out for attention). The Genesis story clearly states that Noah and his family are to be spared from impending disaster because Noah \u201cwalks with God,\u201d as Adam did before the Fall. In this lecture, the 7th in the series, I intermingle the story of Noah and his survival with elements of the Sermon on the Mount, making the effort to explain to a modern audience why careful moral attitude and behavior comprises the best defence against \u201cthe righteous anger of God.\u201d \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

They are corrected here.\n\nLife at the individual and the societal level is punctuated by crisis and catastrophe. This stark truth finds its narrative representation in the widely-distributed universal motif of the flood. Mircea Eliade, the great Romanian historian of religion, noted that flood stories identify two reasons for the destruction: (1) the tendency of complex things to fall apart of their own accord; (2) the proclivity of human beings to speed up that process by sinning, or missing the mark (by engaging in self-evident corruption, or by failing to attend to what cries out for attention). The Genesis story clearly states that Noah and his family are to be spared from impending disaster because Noah \u201cwalks with God,\u201d as Adam did before the Fall. In this lecture, the 7th in the series, I intermingle the story of Noah and his survival with elements of the Sermon on the Mount, making the effort to explain to a modern audience why careful moral attitude and behavior comprises the best defence against \u201cthe righteous anger of God.\u201d \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

Amazing. Breathtaking. \n\nThe only story that can perhaps match it in terms of impact per sentence is that of Cain and Abel, which we discuss in the next lecture: number five in this twelve part series. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

He also rated the accuracy of standoff scenes in \"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"The Enemy Below\", \"Hunter Killer,\" and \"Crimson Tide.\" He also breaks down the realism of costumes, tactics, and terminology from \"U-571.\"\n\nIs life on board a submarine, including confined conditions and drills, as depicted in \"Das Boot\"? Would Navy SEALs enter a submarine from a HALO drop similar to \"Act of Valor\", and is it possible for a submarine to hear music from the water's surface, like in  \"The Wolf's Call\"? Can holes on a submarine be plugged with pins and other metal objects, as we see in \"The Simpsons\"? Would nuclear missiles be triggered by dislodging in a ship interior, such as in \"Aquaman\"?\n\nMarquet graduated top of his class from the US Naval Academy and served for 28 years on submarines, including as an engineer officer aboard the USS Will Rogers, then as captain on the USS Olympia and the USS Santa Fe.

Well under 2 percent of new cars sold in 2019 came with manual transmissions, and companies continue to drop stick shifts from their lineups, even in categories popular with serious car enthusiasts, such as supercars.\n\nIn 2006, 47 percent of the 305 car models sold in the US offered standard or optional manual transmissions. But that number fell over time. One decade later, only 27 percent of new car offered manuals. By 2020, the number was just 13 percent.\n\nThere are a few holdouts of course, and there are still a few sports cars, muscle cars, trucks, and even some cheaper vehicles that still can be bought with a manual. But as automatic transmission technology continues to improve, fewer drivers seem to be seeking out manuals.\n\nSome die-hard enthusiasts cry foul and say the there really is nothing like the feeling of control and connectedness one gets with a manual transmission. They say auto enthusiasts are being underserved by this shift.\n\nWhile the internal combustion engine is expected to be around for awhile, the small but growing popularity of electric cars stands to further marginalize manual transmissions.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ", "date": "Apr 14, 2020", "views": "4,576,279 views", "comments": "24,489", "likes": "57,069 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 808.201, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JuyDN0qzRY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w13ZFGdUO9E": {"title": "Judge Denies Trump Request To Withhold Documents From January 6 Committee", "content creator": "MSNBC", "description": "A federal judge on Tuesday sided with the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot by refusing to block the release of scores of White House documents from the Trump administration.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: ", "date": "Nov 10, 2021", "views": "57,716 views", "comments": "611", "likes": "1,275 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 145.901, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w13ZFGdUO9E"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlSwsE22nX0": {"title": "What Representing Men in Divorce Taught Me About Fatherhood | Marilyn York | TEDxUniversityofNevada", "content creator": "TEDx Talks", "description": "Attorney Marilyn York owns a Men\u2019s Rights Family Law Firm in Reno Nevada, established in 2001. She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Yes, this is a real shark and no editing/photoshop was done. To explain, I was watching the shark swim around. When I turned around to watch it I had too much air in my BCD and couldn't grip the rock. We were told to try not to breath out when a shark is above us because they can feel the vibrations of the bubbles. I also wasn't about to put my arm up to release the air and in the moment didn't think to pull my chord. Now to be honest, every time I'm at that mall I am just waiting to see someone in there get ripped to pieces lol. Well, now the time came for me to be that person. This shark obviously has the craziest teeth out of all the sharks in the tank so when he cut that corner and was in my face, my B hole puckered up quite a bit. He seemed like he was about 5 inches in front of me. I had a million thoughts going thru my head. At first was to take off, but instantly told myself no chance and dumb idea (I can't out swim a shark). Next thought, hey look, there's everyone watching, just waiting for that mauling lol. And of course I thought it was the end. But it also seemed to drag out and I remembered the laughing shark from Strange Wilderness. Overall, I think I handled my cool. After that was over my buddy I was diving with was trying to tell me to calm down. I was trying to explain to him I keep going up and I need to stay down. My dive buddy was a Brother from the Marine Corps so you know he wasn't about to help me lol.

Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.\n\nHe is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.\n\nRichard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He has been awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the Nakayama Prize, the Cosmos International Prize, the Kistler Prize, the Shakespeare Prize and the Lewis Thomas Prize.\n\nLawrence M.

Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist and Scientific American and appears regularly on radio and television. He is one of the few scientists to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, and is also active in issues of science and society.

The intention was a breakthrough to Rome.\n\nAt the beginning of 1944, the western half of the Winter Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido-Gari, Liri and Garigliano valleys and some of the surrounding peaks and ridges. Together, these features formed the Gustav Line. Monte Cassino, a historic hilltop abbey founded in AD 529 by Benedict of Nursia, dominated the nearby town of Cassino and the entrances to the Liri and Rapido valleys. Lying in a protected historic zone, it had been left unoccupied by the Germans, although they manned some positions set into the steep slopes below the abbey's walls.\n\nRepeated pinpoint artillery attacks on Allied assault troops caused their leaders to conclude the abbey was being used by the Germans as an observation post, at the very least. Fears escalated along with casualties and in spite of a lack of clear evidence, it was marked for destruction. On February 15th USAAF bombers dropped 1,400 tons of high explosives, creating widespread damage. The raid failed to achieve its objective, as German paratroopers then occupied the rubble and established excellent defensive positions amid the ruins.", "date": "Jan 16, 2022", "views": "21,308 views", "comments": "47", "likes": "293 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 15.566, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOIu1ZUGHf8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp3wQhDpQG8&list=RDCMUC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg&start_radio=1&rv=wp3wQhDpQG8": {"title": "How The Americans Outproduced Everyone Else In WW2 | War Factories | Timeline", "content creator": "Timeline - World History Documentaries", "description": "How the Americans, once they were provoked into war, out-produced the rest of the world so quickly and by such a huge margin, including the likes of General Motors.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa It's like Netflix for history...

A civilization that was founded on discipline, sacrifice and frugality where the onus was on the collective and the goal was to create the perfect state, and the perfect warrior.  Classical historian Bettany Hughes reveals the secrets and complexities of everyday Spartan life: homosexuality was compulsory, money was outlawed, equality was enforced, weak boys were put to death and women enjoyed a level of social and sexual freedom that was unheard of in the ancient world. It was a nation of fearsome fighters where a glorious death was treasured. This can be aptly demonstrated by the kamikaze last stand at Thermopylae, where King Leonidas and his warriors fought with swords, hands and teeth to fend off the Persian invaders and show the rest of the world what it meant to be Spartan.    Sparta was ruthlessly militaristic and founded on a belief that good order and justice protected against chaos and lawlessness. Policed by secret spies the society was supported by a nation of slaves so all Spartan men had to do was fight. Boys were indoctrinated with the Spartan code of death and glory, separated from their mothers at seven and left to fend for themselves. It led Aristotle to comment that Sparta \"turned its children into animals.\" The training continued throughout adolescence, the most able boys being let loose as death squads preying on the slave population to keep them quiet.  It cannot lay claim to the philosophers or artists of Athens but Sparta contributed as much to western civilisation as Athens did. Indeed it was Sparta, not Athens that was the first city to offer citizenship to its inhabitants. To many, the ideals formed 2500 years ago in Sparta can be seen as a fore-runner of modern-day totalitarianism.  By setting out to create a perfect society protected by perfect warriors, Sparta made an enemy of change. A collapsing birth-rate, too few warriors, rebellious slaves, and outdated attitudes to weaponry and warfare combined to sow the seeds of Sparta's destruction. Eventually the once great warrior state was reduced to a stop for Roman tourists who came to view the bizarre sado-masochistic rituals.

But then again, you voted for this video.\nAs I described it when I put it up to be voted on, I believe Trump's single biggest failure as a president is his handling of China and the way his ineffective and lack-luster foreign policy allowed for a communist dictatorship to rise and build a superpower within a block of unfree states that can even rival the United States and has by now even found ways to influence the politics of democratic nations.\n\nI would like to underline one thing though. I despise the \"orange man bad!\" \"Dump Drumpf\" political culture developing in the United States, in which even Trump's opposition just constantly meanders about pointless and meaningless things rather than actually criticize the president's stupid policies. With that in mind, videos I will be making about the election as 2020 approaches will be more focused on looking at and critiquing actual policies and not about pedantic nonsense. Because I genuinely believe that Trump has been a terrible president, but the reason why the U.S public complains about him has nothing to do with why he is terrible.\n\nI hope you enjoy this video. It's long because I believe for people to understand the gravity of the situation one needs to have a basic understanding of Chinese history going back a few thousand years, from the many Dynasties of the Han, Qing and Yuan, to the century of Humiliation, to the brutal civil war between communists and the Kuomintang, to the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, to where we are now, which is China is a world power that actively challenges America's role in the world. The Belt and Road initiative that builds a new silk road, the Chinese Dream policy, and doctrine, the String of Pearls strategy, it's influence of Australian and European politics, and the way it created and opened markets in African nations such as Kenya are all discussed here in a historical context, that I hope will give you much insight. I hope you will enjoy it.\n\nIf you want to vote on the topic of the next video, you have to become a patron.
