Now, for the first time, one of these communities has agreed to open their doors to our cameras.\nAt first sight, time seems to have stopped in the colony of Little Belize, in South America. People travel around on horse-drawn carriages and still speak Plattdeutsch, an old German dialect. But even here, signs of the outside world are creeping in. Wilhelm, the community\u2019s former doctor, was recently expelled for owning a mobile phone. Fearing their community is being tainted, some traditional members, like Abram and his family, have decided to create a new colony, even more isolated, in the jungle of Peru, where they can remain true to their original doctrine.\nWe follow them on their exodus and take an unprecedented look at the world of the Mennonites.\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: ", "date": "Oct 27, 2021", "views": "2,001,250 views", "comments": "3,614", "likes": "18,761 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3102.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWfGXOjBF2E", "id": "yWfGXOjBF2E"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVvHYTtHDrc": {"title": "FREE Abandoned Airplane...

That was the fate of Queen Catherine Parr\u2019s body after her death in 1548. After being given the first Protestant funeral for English royalty in history, Catherine lay undisturbed in the Chapel of Sudeley Castle for over 200 years. Then her body was rediscovered by grave hunters and disinterred multiple times in the 1780s. One of these disinterments led to a disgraceful and gruesome case of grave desecration. By the time she was finally (badly) reburied, the remains of Henry VIII\u2019s sixth wife were in terrible condition. In this six wives documentary from History Calling, we go back first to September 1548 to look at how Catherine\u2019s body was handled and interred after her death from childbirth complications. She still had a funeral fit for a Queen, but it was very different to any of the ceremonies observed after the deaths of Henry\u2019s other wives. We\u2019ll learn about the actions of her chief mourner, who was Lady Jane Grey, see where she is buried and learn about the funeral procession and service which preceded her interment, for this was a funeral of a Queen which was like no other before it. The second part of the video will look at the events surrounding the rediscovery of this famous body and provide detailed, contemporary accounts of how she was mishandled and her eventual and final reburying. \n\nInstagram: ", "date": "Dec 10, 2021", "views": "400,722 views", "comments": "848", "likes": "10,441 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1354.841, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6lPB4uzmwI", "id": "p6lPB4uzmwI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsgDUzAE88o&list=RDLVfsgDUzAE88o&start_radio=1": {"title": "Trust God's Timing - God has perfect Plan for your Life.

Like many animals, cats are largely guided by their sense of smell; and if an object smells like you, they want to be near it because it makes them feel safe and content. \nAnother reason cats like to sit on your items is because they're very territorial. When cats walk over your stuff, they transfer their pheromones  to the object, giving it a scent that's uniquely theirs. This is a cat\u2019s way to establish their ownership. \nAnd remember, cats are intelligent animals, so they know that whatever you\u2019re reading is taking up all your attention\u2014and that\u2019s the very attention they want for themselves. So they\u2019ll sit or walk right over your stuff so that you\u2019ll have to focus on them. \nWhy cats sneer\nThis phenomenon has a scientific name; It\u2019s called the Flehman response. And this behavior isn\u2019t limited to domestic cats. Many other mammals, including lions and horses perform this action too. \nWhen a cat displays the Flehmen response, they\u2019re basically analyzing a particular scent.\nThis response lets the scent travel along the roof of the mouth where a specialized sensory structure known as the vomeronasal organ is located.\nWhy cats don\u2019t always cover their waste\nIn the wild, weaker and smaller cats bury their excrement to eliminate odors and prevent attracting the attention of predators.\nDominant cats that are competing for territory, such as leopards, lions, and tigers, often don\u2019t bury their feces, sending a message that they are declaring that the area is theirs. Mountain lions even build a little hill using dirt and leaves and then deposit their poop on top.\nWhen a domesticated cats suddenly chooses not to bury their waste, they may want to let other cats know about their presence.\nYour cat may also not bury their waste if they don\u2019t like the texture or smell of the litter. Painful medical problems, like a urinary tract infection or a sore paw, might also make a cat want to poop outside litter box. \nWhy cats blep\nBlepping is when your cat sticks their tongue out of their mouth. \nExperts say blepping is the way cats investigate their surroundings, using their sense of taste to understand what\u2019s going on around them.\nBlepping may also happen when the cat forgets to put their tongue back in after eating or grooming. It can happen when you distract them in the middle of an eating or grooming session. \nWhy kittens freeze when grabbed by the neck\nAt one time or another you\u2019ve probably witnessed a mother cat carrying her kittens around by the scruff of their neck. This form of transport is known as scruffing. \nThey can do that because kittens have a reflex in which their bodies go totally limp when picked up by the scruff. \nThe scruff was designed by nature as a handle to transport kittens from one place to another. \nWhy cats follow you everywhere in the house\nIf you live with a feline, you\u2019ll have noticed that they follow you everywhere. \nMore often than not, cats follow us around because they like our companionship. Contrary to what many people believe, cats love being with their human companions. \nAnother reason why cats follow you is because they want to be entertained. It's common for felines to be bored because they often spend all their time indoors. \nCats may also follow you when they are patrolling their territory. They want  to spread their scent, and to find possible intruders. \nWhy cats hate closed doors\nIf you have ever closed a door behind your cat, you probably know that a closed room is something that cats hate. \nCats may be attracted to closed doors because they want to know what is happening on the other side of it, especially if they hear or smell something that piques their curiosity.\nPawing at your closed door also indicates that your pet enjoys your company and wants to hang out with you.  \nAnd keep in mind that some cats don\u2019t like closed doors because of their territorial nature. Cats believe they actually own your house and they get confused when part of their territory is closed off from them.\nWhy cats pee outside the litter box\nThe state or quality of the litter in the box is usually the reason of out-of-box urination. Cats are very clean animals, and they don\u2019t like visiting a litter box that is not regularly cleaned. \nThe proper litter box set up will offer your feline peace and privacy, but it must still be easy for your cat to access.\nUrine-marking is another reason cats may urinate out of the litter box.\nStress or medical issues are also a huge factor when it comes to house-soiling issues.", "date": "May 14, 2021", "views": "6,883,709 views", "comments": "5,562", "likes": "125,142 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 590.341, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m5GJYlQ2sw", "id": "-m5GJYlQ2sw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A&list=RDLV5qap5aO4i9A&start_radio=1": {"title": "lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to", "content creator": "Lofi Girl", "description": "\ud83e\udd17 Thank you for listening, I hope you will have a good time here\n\n\ud83d\udc55 | Lofi Girl merch\n\u2192  https://bit.ly/Iofigirl-shop\n\n\u2714\ufe0f | This music is free to use in your livestreams & videos\n\u2192  https://bit.ly/lofigirl-usethemusic\n\n\ud83c\udfbc | Listen on Spotify, Apple music and more\n\u2192  https://bit.ly/lofigirI-playlists\n\n\ud83d\udcac | Join the Lofi Girl community\n\u2192   https://bit.ly/lofigirl-discord\n\u2192   https://bit.ly/lofigirl-reddit\n\n\ud83c\udf0e | Lofi Girl on all social media\n\u2192  https://bit.ly/lofigirl-sociaI\n\n\ud83c\udfb6 | Radio tracklist\n\u2192  https://bit.ly/lofi-tracklist\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 | Art by Juan Pablo Machado\n\u2192  https://bit.ly/Machadofb\n\n\ud83c\udf84 | Christmas theme by Enrico Camerra\n\u2192  https://www.instagram.com/enricocamerra/\n\n\ud83d\udcdd | Submit your music / art\n\u2192  https://bit.ly/lofi-submission", "date": "Started streaming on Feb 22, 2020", "views": "22,062 watching now", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "Unavailable", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 18961712.084000003, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A&list=RDLV5qap5aO4i9A&start_radio=1", "id": "5qap5aO4i9A&list"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy0h0d8qsZk": {"title": "11 Abandoned Places That Really Exist!", "content creator": "Hidden Worlds", "description": "It is always fascinating.

Supported by a team of experts Felix Baumgartner plans to ascend to 120,000 feet in a stratospheric balloon and make a freefall jump rushing toward earth at supersonic speeds before parachuting to the ground. His attempt to dare atmospheric limits holds the potential to provide valuable medical and scientific research data for future pioneers.\n\nThe Red Bull Stratos team brings together the world's leading minds in aerospace medicine, engineering, pressure suit development, capsule creation and balloon fabrication. It includes retired United States Air Force Colonel Joseph Kittinger, who holds three of the records Felix will strive to break.\n\nJoe's record jump from 102,800 ft in 1960 was during a time when no one knew if a human could survive a jump from the edge of space. Joe was a Captain in the U.S. Air Force and had already taken a balloon to 97,000 feet in Project ManHigh and survived a drogue mishap during a jump from 76,400 feet in Excelsior I. The Excelsior III mission was his 33rd parachute jump.\n\nAlthough researching extremes was part of the program's goals, setting records wasn't the mission's purpose. Joe ascended in helium balloon launched from the back of a truck. He wore a pressurized suit on the way up in an open, unpressurized gondola. Scientific data captured from Joe's jump was shared with U.S. research personnel for development of the space program. Today Felix and his specialized team hope to take what was learned from Joe's jumps more than 50 years ago and press forward to test the edge of the human envelope.\n\n\nFelix Baumgartner - \n\n\n\"On a mission like this, you need to be mentally fit and have total control over what you do, and I'm preparing very thoroughly.\" \n\nFelix consistently challenges his personal limits while pushing the physical boundaries of human flight. In 2003, Felix completed an unprecedented flight across the English Channel with a carbon wing, and subsequently began to consider an even bigger goal: the supersonic freefall. With a team of the world's top scientists, engineers and doctors behind him, Felix will attempt to rewrite history and advance aeronautical research with Red Bull Stratos.\n\n\n\nThis footage belongs entirely to Red Bull\u2122 and I'm just sharing it, nonprofit.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92012 RED BULL", "date": "Oct 14, 2012", "views": "42,258,414 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "Unavailable", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1194.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvbN-cWe0A0", "id": "vvbN-cWe0A0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAGdedgvWKI": {"title": "Marvel vs. DC: Most Money Grossing Movies 1978 - 2019", "content creator": "Data Is Beautiful", "description": "Timeline history of all movies from Marvel Comics brand versus DC Comics brand starting 1978 to 2019.

But his new strategy, which centers on thousands of additional U.S. troops and an intensification of airstrikes, has only just begun to produce gains.\n\nThe Taliban, facing renewed pressure, have increased terror attacks on major cities, striking at the heart of Kabul recently, in a series of devastating attacks that left hundreds of civilians dead in the span of a week.\n\nVICE\u2019s Ben Anderson travelled to Afghanistan in October 2016 as the Taliban were on the verge of retaking Helmand Province, once a crucial territory in the U.S. war.

But big dreams and spectacular hits also call for a bigger stage than the Moon Theater. The Crystal Tower Theater in the glamorous big city would be perfect - but there's one small problem. Actually, three. First, Buster Moon, mother pig Rosita, rocker porcupine Ash, elephant Meena, gorilla Johnny and pop provocateur, pig Gunter, must somehow make it to the office of music mogul Jimmy Crystal and convince the unscrupulous wolf to let them use his theater. It's a hopeless endeavor until Gunter spontaneously promises him the scoop: rock legend Clay Calloway (Bono) will return to the stage for this show! The problem: Buster has never met Clay, a lion who has retired from show business! While Moon's all-star ensemble works to put on the spectacular show, the koala sets out to find Clay. What begins as a dream of great success becomes an emotional reminder of the healing power of music.\n\n\u00a9 Universal Pictures\n\nThis holiday season, the new chapter in Illumination\u2019s smash animated franchise arrives with big dreams and spectacular hit songs as the ever-optimistic koala, Buster Moon, and his all-star cast of performers prepare to launch their most dazzling stage extravaganza yet \u2026all in the glittering entertainment capital of the world. There\u2019s just one hitch: They first have to persuade the world\u2019s most reclusive rock star\u2014played by global music icon Bono, in his animated film debut\u2014to join them.\n \nBuster (Oscar\u00ae winner Matthew McConaughey) has turned the New Moon Theater into a local hit, but Buster has his eyes on a bigger prize: Debuting a new show at the Crystal Tower Theater in glamorous Redshore City.\n \nBut with no connections, Buster and his cast\u2014including harried mother pig Rosita (Oscar\u00ae winner Reese Witherspoon), rocker porcupine Ash (Scarlett Johansson), earnest gorilla Johnny (Taron Egerton), shy elephant Meena (Tori Kelly) and, of course, porcine provocateur Gunter (Nick Kroll)\u2014have to sneak their way into the world-famous Crystal Entertainment offices, run by ruthless mogul wolf Jimmy Crystal (Emmy winner Bobby Cannavale).\n \nIn a desperate attempt to get Mr. Crystal\u2019s attention, Gunter spontaneously pitches an outrageous idea that Buster quickly runs with, promising that their new show will star lion rock legend Clay Calloway (Bono). Problem is, Buster has never met Clay, an artist who shut himself away from the world more than a decade ago after the loss of his wife. Even worse, Buster has failed to realize that Mr. Crystal is an egocentric gangster who would rather drop somebody off the roof of a building than be lied to.\n \nAs Gunter helps Buster dream up an out-of-this-world theatrical masterpiece, and the pressure (and sinister threats) from Mr. Crystal mount, Rosita\u2019s leading role in the show gets ripped away and handed to Mr. Crystal\u2019s spoiled daughter, Porsha, played by Grammy-nominated artist Halsey. Desperate to save the show, and his life, Buster embarks on a quest to find Clay and persuade him to return to the stage.\n \nWhat begins as a dream of big-time success becomes an emotional reminder of the power of music to heal even the most broken heart.\n \nSing 2 is written and directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Garth Jennings and features additional new characters played by music superstar Pharrell Williams, Black Panther\u2019s Letitia Wright and comedians Eric Andre and Chelsea Peretti.\n \nThe film is produced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri and by Janet Healy. Sing 2 combines dozens of classic rock and pop hit songs, electrifying performances, breathtaking artistry and Illumination\u2019s signature humor and heart into the definitive feel-good cinematic event of the year.", "date": "Dec 10, 2021", "views": "6,353,870 views", "comments": "488", "likes": "76,208 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 24.601, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM2sH5I7Huk", "id": "iM2sH5I7Huk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6zunD1L6VY": {"title": "Gordon Ramsay Goes Berserk At Lying Chef | Kitchen Nightmares FULL EPISODE", "content creator": "All In The Kitchen", "description": "Gordon Ramsay gets into a hilarious argument over whether or not roast potatoes have been deep-fried or not.\n\nFull Episodes from the Gordon Ramsay Back catalog.

A dog\u2019s sense of smell is much stronger than ours, and for them, a shirt covered in your scent is one of the most comforting objects in the world.\nAnd this is why you may often find your dog lying on top of your pile of dirty clothes. Your clothing has your scent on it and dogs always want to feel closer to you. \nTaking new routes\nDogs are curious and love nothing more than sniffing around and exploring. Your dog will be grateful if you stop taking them for the same walk every day. \nMix up your route once in a while. You can do this by simply walking in a different direction every now and then. \nChecking their \u201cpee-mail\u201d and \u201csocial media\u201d\nDogs urine marking is a serious business for canines. \nBy urine marking, your dog is leaving messages. Then other dogs come along and check the message and may leave a message of their own by urinating small amounts over or adjacent to the original spot. This is a unique form of communication where your dog will tell another dog if they sense danger. Or even let them know about their sexual availability. \nUnlike humans who have to use social media apps to catch up on all their friend\u2019s news, all a dog needs is a whiff of a very prominent vertical surface\nFor you to be happy\nYour happiness is the most important thing for your dog. In fact, recent studies have shown that when we get stressed, our dogs get stressed, too.\nDogs can sense when we are happy or upset using their keen sense of smell and unique ability to read body language. When your dog notices that you are in distress, their attitude will adjust to your needs.  And when you are happy, your dog\u2019s behavior reflects the environment. \nPet them where they enjoy it most\nHow does your dog prefer being pet?\nA study published in Journal of Veterinary Behavior found that dogs show more signs of stress\u2014like yawning, freezing, lip licking, or elevated heart rates\u2014when they are pet on the head, muzzle, shoulders or paws. Petting on the chest however, is associated with a decrease of heart rate, and is more calming to a dog. Nevertheless, many dogs are comfortable with any types of interactions\u2014even with strangers\u2014because they\u2019re used to being around people. \n\nA loving glance\nDogs love a loving glance.  \nRecent studies have shown that making eye contact while cuddling with your dog releases a love hormone in them known as oxytocin. Every time you gaze lovingly into your dog\u2019s eyes, their levels of oxytocin go up. In fact, studies have shown that this action produces the same biological response as a mother looking at her child. \nGoing for walks over food\nA study conducted in the UK aimed to identify the words and phrases that canines love to hear the most. \nBelieve it or not, 'walkies' scooped the top spot, with a dog's heart rate increasing by a whopping 36% every time they hear the word. Other words that make our furry friends the happiest are 'treat', 'get it', and 'fetch'.\nDogs love walks because they fulfill that old, inbuilt survival instinct to go out and search for food. \nSeeing the world through the windows\nOpen some of your shades and blinds, so your dog can see what\u2019s going on outdoors. Dogs can spend countless hours staring out a window and watching the world go by. \nA challenging puzzle to solve\nWhen you\u2019re considering what toys to get your dog, include a puzzle toy that involves a challenge followed by a reward. Dogs are intelligent creature that need mental exercise, and they\u2019ll act out if they are bored. \nA favorite meal\nDogs don\u2019t like it when you eat the best food, and all they get is dog food. Prepare a special meal for your furry friend every now and then, and let them enjoy their favorite dish.  \nEating in Private\nWhen your dog is eating, respect their bliss and let them be. Dogs don\u2019t like eating in high traffic areas and they need their privacy while eating. Minimize dish handling and let your pooch enjoy their meal. \nRunning errands with you.\nAnything\u2019s better than waiting for you at home, right? \nIt\u2019s good to get out, and there are so many places you can take your dog. Just remember not to leave your pet unattended in a parked car for any period of time. \nBeing accepted For Who They Are\nThere's great happiness in being loved as you are rather than being pressured to be what you\u2019re not. That\u2019s as true for dogs as it is for people. So, if your dog sniffs urine or poop, let them, as preventing them from their own nature can cause anxiety and confusion. Dogs hate constant correction from you and it is important that you love your dog just as he is. \nVacation\nInstead of leaving your dog at pet sitter\u2019s home, plan a dog-friendly vacation. After all, dogs are our family members, and they certainly deserve a trip to a new place. There are many hotels that are pet friendly. If you have a small dog, air travel is easier.", "date": "Mar 1, 2021", "views": "6,435,450 views", "comments": "3,594", "likes": "88,556 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 530.301, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgCIZZodox8", "id": "SgCIZZodox8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21qNxnCS8WU": {"title": "\uff23\uff28\uff29\uff2c\uff2c\u3000\uff32\uff21\uff24\uff29\uff2f \uff12\uff14\uff0f\uff17", "content creator": "the bootleg boy 2", "description": "Lofi Hip Hop beats for chilling and studying to \n\ud83c\udfa7 Chill / Study Beats \ud83c\udfa7\n\n\nThis is a 24/7 lofi hip hop stream from the bootleg boy 2 channel.

Here, he reacts to 10 memorable bodyguard scenes from movies and TV and rates them based on their accuracy. \n\nBombace looks at private security details under attack in \"Man on Fire\" (2004) and \"Bodyguard\" (2018). He addresses scenes featuring pop stars at concerts and award shows, such as \"Taken\" (2008) and \"The Bodyguard\" (1992). He also discusses transporting and taking care of political clients, as seen in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" (2017) and \"The West Wing\" season three episodes 20 and 21 (2002), and billionaires like Tony Stark in \"Iron Man 3\" (2013). \n\nHow should bodyguards react when their principal tries to shake them off, as in \"Arrow\" (2020)? How much information about threats should the principal be aware of, like in \"Close\" (2019)? How should you deal with an inebriated celebrity client, as Malcom does in \"Empire\" (2015-)? \n\nBodyguards go through intense training to be ready to protect actors, singers, CEOs, and politicians. Security firm Global Threat Solutions has protected the likes of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and hosts trainings for new bodyguards trying to break into the field. \n\nFind out more about Global Threat Solutions here: ", "date": "Dec 29, 2020", "views": "1,390,165 views", "comments": "975", "likes": "29,947 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1249.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrPLmRL-3fU", "id": "NrPLmRL-3fU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arxOB5u9kaE": {"title": "Will it run after 81 years 1929 gmc truck", "content creator": "Jennings Motor sports", "description": "Will this 1929 gmc 2 ton run after 81 years of being abandoned in the woods the truck has a 310 cubic inch Buick not a 216 \nWill it run \nWill it run after 30 years \nWill it start", "date": "Sep 7, 2021", "views": "5,655,128 views", "comments": "10,728", "likes": "142,669 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2190.321, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arxOB5u9kaE", "id": "arxOB5u9kaE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI133HNGNfk": {"title": "How VHS Gaming Conned Us | Nostalgia Nerd", "content creator": "Nostalgia Nerd", "description": "Head to https://www.squarespace.com/nostalgia... to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain using code NOSTALGIANERD....
