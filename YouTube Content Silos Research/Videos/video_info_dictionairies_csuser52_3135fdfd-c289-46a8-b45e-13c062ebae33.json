I think that's the biggest deal because you think about the dossier, Todd, and the fact that it drove a news cycle for three years during the Trump presidency and everything that was in it, all the salacious things was discussed endlessly on CNN. And the fact that... that was what the paper was printed on and a media show doesn't cover the fact that so many news organizations were duped by this dossier, which led to the Russia investigation, which dominated the Trump news cycle. I think if you ignore that, then you're no longer a media show. You are engaging in the bias of omission, which is the most insidious bias there is as far as not telling viewers something that obviously should be very important to them, particularly if you're a media show.\n...\nSubscribe to Fox News!

Palliative care is sometimes misunderstood to shorten life expectancy, but it\u2019s a method that increases quality of life, improves symptom burden and decreases medical costs. We follow Dr. Tremonti in John Beder's \"Dying in Your Mother's Arms\" as she works to make death less medical and more human.

The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space.

Her message? The gift of happiness truly lies within our own hearts and minds. Gen Kelsang Nyema, exuding a peacefulness that immediately connects with the audience, starts by asking three questions: Are you having a good day? Why? Tomorrow, would you rather have a good day or a bad day? She teaches that we cannot put our happiness at the whim of other people and of circumstances. If we want to be happy, we have to \"stop outsourcing our happiness to other people\" and cultivate a source of inner peace. What happens next is quite astounding. The whole crowd of 350+ people proceeds to meditate with Nyema. There's a little squirming at first, but as she leads the audience through a calm citation of how to rest the mind, audience members feel a collective relaxation flow into the room and through the people.

These two plans are great options to fund a home purchase or if you are looking to further your education. The third reason would be if you are in a low tax bracket. Maybe you were laid off or you're at home raising your children...there are a number of reasons why you may be in a lower tax bracket during your professional career, and it may be helpful to start withdrawing funds from your RRSP in those times to reduce your tax bill.\n\nAt retirement, you're going to need to convert your RRSP to a RRIF. This must be done by at least the age of 71, although it can be done earlier than that. RRIF income can be split whereas RRSP income cannot, so that is something to look into when you are planning on converting your RRSP to a RRIF.\n\nIf you have any further questions about this video's topic or any financial planning questions in general, I encourage you to\u202ffind a certified financial planner\u202fin your area or\u202fbook a consultation with us to get your savings plan on track.\u202f You can email\u202fInfo@Parallelwealth.com\u202fand we will set up a meeting with you.\n-----------------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER: The videos and opinions on this channel are for informational and educational purposes only and do not constitute investment advice.

It originated in India as khichri, a dish made using lentils, rice, onions and spices. \n\nAs the \u2018jewel in the crown\u2019 of the British Empire, the culture of the subcontinent influenced language, fashion and food in England in the 19th century. But Indian ingredients and techniques were difficult to come by in England, so dishes were adapted to suit English tastes and ingredients. Khichri became kedgeree.\n\nINGREDIENTS \n200g cooked rice\n200g unsmoked fish\n50g unsalted butter\n\u00bd-1 tsp cayenne pepper\n1 tsp coarse grain salt\n2 eggs\n\nOptional:\nA little cream\nPickled or hard-boiled quail\u2019s eggs\nParsley and Brown shrimp for garnishing\n\nMETHOD\nPoach your fish in a mixture of half water and half milk. You\u2019ll know that the fish is ready when the flesh becomes opaque - around seven minutes depending on the type of fish you\u2019ve used.\n\nBreak up the poached fish into large flakes with a fork \nLightly whisk your eggs and prepare your garnishes. Slice the hard boiled quail\u2019s eggs in half, and finely chop the parsley.\n\nHeat the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat until it foams and just starts to brown. Add the rice and stir well to coat it in butter. \n\nFry it over a high heat to ensure it is piping hot throughout\nTurn the heat down slightly and add the flaked fish, salt and cayenne pepper. Stir more gently now, turning the fish so that it does not break up too much.\n\nWhen everything is heated thoroughly, turn the temperature right down, and add the egg mixture. Turn very gently, just enough to mix the eggs in, and before they are solid, remove the pan from the heat. The eggs should still be slightly runny, as they would be on a good omelette.\n\nStir in the cream to stop the kedgeree overcooking, then transfer onto a serving dish.\n\nGarnish the kedgeree. Arrange the quail\u2019s egg halves around the dish and add the chopped parsley for a touch of colour. Serve immediately, while the kedgeree is still hot.\n\nDiscover more Victorian recipes: ", "date": "Feb 27, 2018", "views": "3,165,627 views", "comments": "5,399", "likes": "67,417 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 265.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD9j-Xka6sA&list=RDCMUCHwNa3lAjzbxRR2pbbZUE2A&index=5"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLfbHPEAGo&list=RDCMUCHYoe8kQ-7Gn9ASOlmI0k6Q&start_radio=1&rv=nDLfbHPEAGo": {"title": "Food Theory: McDonalds WANTS It Broken!
