Honestly I regret choosing this one because the Santa/Jesus crossover book sounds so much more amusing. That said, I\u2019m pretty sure the Christmas ones are much worse. This one has a sequel, The Eye of Moloch, which I may get around to some day, but I\u2019m in no rush. From what it sounds like, it was actually the second half of this story, which explains why it ends so suddenly. There was also a stage production of this book. It was done ironically though, so I figured I could skip it.\n\nI was disheartened to learn how little of his books Glenn actually writes. I think that\u2019s what kept is from getting into some really awful crap. Ultimately it\u2019s not as bad as Ben Shapiro\u2019s novel because of that. And that was disappointing.\n\nI added some context for people unfamiliar with who Glenn Beck was/is, and why he still matters today. Some of the history may not be exact, and I may have played down the racist elements of the Tea Party movement, but the important part is how it shaped politics today.

They settled on land that had only recently been covered by glaciers. This species, called Neanderthals, died out about 30,000 years ago -- but at one time, they formed the largest group in an area that stretched from northern France to the Belgian coast and from the Channel Islands to southern England. \n\nDuring the last Ice Age, the North Sea was frozen over -- and the English Channel was a small river that could easily be crossed on foot. The Neanderthals lived in close harmony with their perpetually changing environment. They had everything they needed to survive: the meat of prey animals, edible wild plants, water and wood for cooking and heating. How did these early humans develop over almost 300,000 years? What were their lives like before they became extinct? \n\nOur documentary is based on the latest research. We investigate various populations of Neanderthals, and visit archaeological sites in northern France, southern England, and on the island of Jersey. \n\nRenowned researchers such as the British paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer and his French colleague Ludovic Slimak describe how the Neanderthals lived, and discuss their cognitive abilities. Was this species capable of structured thinking? Did they have cultures, languages, and societies? How intelligent were they, and what sort of adaptive strategies kept them alive for 300,000 years? How similar were they to modern-day humans?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Not if you understand biochemistry, which creationists do not.

In this case, that hero is James Tour, a synthetic organic chemist who insists that abiogenesis is impossible, and he should know better than anyone, because he's a chemist. I was made aware of Dr. Tour after a couple hundred people linked me to a video of his in an empty argument from authority, insisting that because a chemist confirms their religious bias, they must be right. But is Dr. Tour a bit biased himself? Let's find out precisely what his agenda is, shall we?\n\nUpdate: James Tour responded to this single video with a dumpster fire of a 14-part series overflowing with stupidity and lies, which qualifies for the Dunning-Kruger Hall of Fame.
