India is actually one of the world\u2019s most linguistically diverse countries \u2013 in addition to Hindi and English, hundreds of other languages are spoken, including, in a small corner of northern India, the Punjabi language. The Punjabi people live spread across both India and Pakistan and have a rich and beautiful culture with incredible food, music, and religion. And here in New York City if you head to Punjab Avenue in Queens you\u2019ll find a small but thriving community of Punjabis, particularly Punjabi Sikhs but also Hindus, Muslims, and Christians as well. So this week I brushed up on my Punjabi and headed out there to chat with the locals, who are wonderfully encouraging when it comes to learning their language.

(CUTEST DOG EVER)", "content creator": "Life with Malamutes", "description": "We told you that time was coming again!! Phil never learns as he gleefully wallows in mud galore! He's so happy until he's home and has to turn left at the top of the stairs, the realisation hits! The despair is real! The dog lives for peanut butter but he pretends its not there in a desperate bid to vanish. Phil mimics a statue as he stares into the wall trying to remain hidden! He is hilarious in his characteristics I'm sure you'll agree...\n\nSo things took a different turn this time. Harley (Phil's favourite person) offered to wash Phil to see if the situation could be more pleasing for him. First off she tried reasoning but it wasn't working. She tried to take a more forceful approach but Phil was adamant it wasn't happening! \n\nHe is such a big baby all the drama before to then get in and be fine, sometimes he remembers when he is in the bath and starts to act again but generally once the ordeal of getting in is over he is pretty much fine! \n\nIf this is the first time you've seen Phil take a bath and long for more of this, don't worry we got you covered! There are a few Phil bath saga's in our library just search 'sulking dog'\n\nMilo has also suffered the wrath of the bath, only once though haha he was quite chill actually!\n\nNiko doesn't min the bath and in the last video she even got in to show off!\n\nPhil starts throwing a tantrum and Niko gets wind of this so the two start howling mid video - it's quite loud in a bathroom haha. \n\nOf course Mia was there for support once again, she even tries to help wash her teddy bear at one point, she doesn't want to see him upset!\n\nBut the golden moments are Harley's failures.

After hard working days, at the end of the day I want to spend every remaining time for myself by visiting a certain coffee shop and relaxing. Today, too, I visited my familiar coffee shop, calling it a coffee shop, maybe it's not quite right, it's a book coffee. Many people ask me why I'm loyal to that cafe because maybe because the space looks very cozy with the shimmering lights that make me feel at home, that's the difference. its. A special feature that is different from other coffee shops is that this shop has a lot of good books, I also call it the book cafe. The bookshelves are arranged very delicately and reasonably. The decoration of flower pots or candles looks very eye-catching and attracts customers inside and outside the shop. Sitting and relaxing with a cup of coffee reading a book combined with melodious and relaxing Jazz music makes me able to forget all the fatigue and stress in my head. I really fell in love with this book cafe.

Although one from her beloved bookshop Shakespeare and Company. The Argentine-British actor professes, \u2018I tidied it up for you guys.\u2019 \nThe Last Night In Soho (2021) star is an avid reader and keeps at least one paperback in her bag. At the moment it\u2019s Kink: Stories by Garth Greenwell and RO Kwon, and her second choice, The Dud Avocado by Elaine Dundy. \u2018I believe everyone should have a book in their bag.\u2019 We quite agree. \n\nWherever her career sweeps her off to, one thing the actor keeps close is her journal to help her process. \u2018I'm always writing, so I always have a notebook on me.\u2019 On the back cover she\u2019s written a quote: \u2018Be content with what you have, rejoice in the way things are. When you realise there's nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you\u2019.\n\nFrom the cerebral world to beauty, Taylor-Joy\u2019s essentials include a bristle hairbrush, complete with a trusty hair band, but she otherwise keeps things simple, packing just mascara and lipstick for her everyday makeup. \n\nMemories, however, take up the most space \u2014 the actor packs photographs and a disposable camera in her bag \u2014 so she can look back on, and capture, important moments. She proudly shows a wallet of polaroids she uses to reminisce on occasions such as the Golden Globes 2021, where she was celebrated for her performance in the award-winning Netflix miniseries The Queen's Gambit (2020). \u2018I started taking photos myself because I forget everything; I like taking photos of people when they're working. I do it like a spy\u2019. \n\nAnd one of Taylor-Joy\u2019s best kept secrets? Her love of crystals and tarot cards: \u2018You wouldn't imagine how many crystals I have in this bag and what it weighs\u2019, she confesses. But, if she had to swap bags? Hands down, Cher or David Bowie are clear winners.\n\nSubscribe to British Vogue\u25ba\u25ba ", "date": "Sep 30, 2021", "views": "732,182 views", "comments": "951", "likes": "33,360 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 284.481, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCUblJ1j0Ag", "id": "ZCUblJ1j0Ag"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc": {"title": "Stanford's Sapolsky On Depression in U.S. (Full Lecture)", "content creator": "Stanford", "description": "Stanford Professor Robert Sapolsky, posits that depression is the most damaging disease that you can experience.

Cats hate strong odors and these scents can discourage your pet from drinking water from their bowl. \nToxic houseplants \nSome plants are toxic to cats.\nCats may ingest toxic plant substances while they lick themselves because there can be pollen or seeds stuck in their fur. Among the most toxic plants are daffodils, English Ivy, azaleas, Calla lilies, aloe, begonias, and ficus.\nGiving bones to them\nCooked bones are a serious danger to felines because they can splinter and get stuck in a cat's throat or stomach\nEssential oils and diffusers\nEssential oils can be toxic to cats whether ingested orally, applied to the skin, or simply inhaled. It\u2019s because cats lack the enzymes that are needed to metabolize essential oils properly.  \nIngredients matter\nImproper feeding can lead to obesity, malnutrition and many health issues. Always monitor the calories in your chosen pet food and adhere to the suggested serving sizes. According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, over 50% of dogs and cats in the US are obese or overweight. \nLitter Box Mistakes\nAs the rule of thumb, it\u2019s best to have at least 1.5 litter boxes per cat. So, if you have one cat, you need two litter boxes; two cats, three litter boxes. it is important to invest in a good, fragrance-free cat litter box and place it in a quiet room that\u2019s free of frequent activity. If your cat is litter trained but urinates on the floor, it\u2019s usually either a sign of urinary tract infections, or a dirty litter box. \nSudden change of diet. \nSudden changes in a cat\u2019s diet may result in vomiting, diarrhea, reduced appetite and a sick feline. Your cat should be transitioned slowly from one food to another. Plan on taking at least a week to transition your kitty from one food to another. \nNot training them\nJust like dogs, cats can be trained. Training your cat will improve your life and theirs, and enhance the bond between you.\nFor example, you can train them to get off the counter, or not to scratch your furniture! \nForcing them to interact with you\nCats are very independent creatures. They don\u2019t like to be smothered with affection and they need some personal space every now and then. \nStoring food in packaging it didn\u2019t originally come in\nThe food\u2019s original packaging keeps it from going stale and drying out. it\u2019s important to properly store and seal the cat food in an air-tight container so it doesn\u2019t go rancid or lose its useful substances.\nExercise for Cats\nJust like dogs, felines need regular exercise to work off extra energy and stay healthy! \nThe best way to exercise a cat is by making them chase their favorite toys around the house. Interactive toys, like a wand toy with feathers, strings, or other prey-like attachments that evoke a cat\u2019s predatory behavior are an excellent way to keep them fit.\nFeeding them milk \nCats are lactose intolerant. In fact, cats will have a stomach problem within ten to twelve hours after consuming it. \nNot enough water\nMany cats don't like water so they don't drink enough of it. Because of this, they are more prone to developing urinary crystals and even kidney problems. More often than not, this can be prevented simply by adding wet food to your cat's diet. You can even add a little water to your cat\u2019s food. And be sure to keep several water bowls in your home, and move their water bowl to somewhere that isn't alongside their food or litter box. \nIgnore their vomiting\nSome people think it's ok for a cat to vomit once a week, but it's not. While vomiting a few times a year or an occasional hairball is normal, vomiting once a week means there is a problem, and a vet visit is necessary. \nNeglecting Their Dental Hygiene \nLike humans, cats need regular dental care. Their teeth are often home to hundreds of bacteria and need to be brushed just like yours do. \nRarely Visiting a Vet\nThe only way to ensure that your pet is as healthy as they can be is by taking them to the vet for a checkup.\nAn occasional checkup makes it easy to catch potential problems . You also want to make sure that your pet gets all of their vaccinations.\nExpecting a Cat to Not Harm a Smaller Pet\nA cat is very likely to kill smaller pets like rabbits, guinea pigs or hamsters because of their natural prey drive. \nBathing Them\nCats are excellent at grooming themselves and they rarely need to be washed. If you decide to wash them, once or twice a year is enough. \nNot avoiding hairballs\nTo avoid the  hairballs, you can brush your cat once a day and add more fiber to their diet. High-fiber diet improves the health of a cat\u2019s coat and minimizes shedding. \nDeclawing them\nDeclawing is torturous to cats. It would be akin to cutting off our fingers at the last knuckle, leading to pain and mobility issues.", "date": "Feb 18, 2021", "views": "3,515,037 views", "comments": "3,786", "likes": "53,565 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 629.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lArwj8ELa10", "id": "lArwj8ELa10"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIovmgzyuL0": {"title": "The Deadly Portuguese Man O' War | Blue Planet II | BBC Earth", "content creator": "BBC Earth", "description": "As it floats on the surface of the ocean, the Man O' War looks beautiful and harmless but packs a killer sting with its deadly tentacles.\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/BBCEarthSub ", "date": "Jul 24, 2021", "views": "3,820,906 views", "comments": "3,679", "likes": "50,537 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 331.741, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIovmgzyuL0", "id": "aIovmgzyuL0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgTfeQ7TdMI": {"title": "UFC 270 Free Fight: Ciryl Gane vs Derrick Lewis", "content creator": "UFC - Ultimate Fighting Championship", "description": "Ciryl Gane was able to secure the interim heavyweight title late in 2021 after he defeated Derrick Lewis at UFC 265 via third-round knockout, earning himself Performance of the Night Honors.

That question is, how did Don Vito instinctively know that the individual behind all these treacherous events was not the obvious Philip Tattaglia, rather the more cunning, Don Emilio Barzini?\n\nAfter his refusal to enter a partnership deal with Philip Tattaglia and Virgil Sollozzo, a hit is placed on him. Even though he miraculously survived the Corleone family is much weaker and has become the target.  However after a series of events unfold , Don Vito needed to step in while still not fully recovered, in order to prevent his empire from collapsing. He calls a meeting with the heads of the 5 families, who rule over New York. At this meeting Vito goes in to make peace with the other families in order to safely bring back his son Michael from his exile in Sicily. But Vito\u2019s goal and intentions behind the meeting were not limited to the reasons he gave the other Dons. Vito needed to verify who was behind these lethal attacks on his family. He knew the other dons fairly well, and these attacks seemed to be far more sophisticated and treacherous than the obvious  for a man like Philip Tattaglia to have put in place. So if his suspicions were true, then his real enemy is yet to reveal himself\u2026\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s exactly what we will uncover in this video. \nAfter watching this video you will know How and Why, Don Vito was able to uncover such a well laid out plot. Taking you through his thought process and allowing us to learn from this scenario. \n \n\ud835\udc6c\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8b\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc97\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc90 & \ud835\udc73\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc98 \ud835\udc98\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc80\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96 \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8c?\ud83d\udd25\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 \ud835\udc09\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc14\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a @\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1a", "date": "Jul 5, 2021", "views": "1,381,029 views", "comments": "2,180", "likes": "24,477 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 841.401, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBMYlxIWfR0", "id": "tBMYlxIWfR0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUUJIRes_yo": {"title": "Freddy questions his existence after seeing Endoskeletons - FNAF Security Breach", "content creator": "Rubhen925", "description": "Five Nights at Freddys: Security Breach - Freddy questions his existence after seeing Endoskeletons - FNAF Security Breach PC PS5 PS4 (2021)\n#FiveNightsAtFreddysSecurityBreach #FiveNightsAtFreddys #FNAF #Rubhen925 #Gameplay ", "date": "Dec 25, 2021", "views": "1,748,351 views", "comments": "1,631", "likes": "49,681 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 55.501, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUUJIRes_yo", "id": "MUUJIRes_yo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNATsAa9sa0": {"title": "What Went Wrong with Dear Evan Hansen", "content creator": "Sarah Z", "description": "#YouWillBeHorrified.
