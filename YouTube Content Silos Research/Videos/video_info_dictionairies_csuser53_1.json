We do talk more news about Elon musk in our tech channel because of his humanitarian vision and amazing work with Tesla's Cybertruck, Camper, EVs, Spacex, space x's starship, Starlink, The Boring Company, neuralink and much more.\n\nElon Musk is the Founder of SpaceX and CEO and product architect of Tesla Inc. Tesla Was founded in 2003. The founders of the company saw the higher fuel efficiency of battery-electric cars as an opportunity to break the usual correlation with high performance and low fuel economy, they decided to create the company. Elon musk joined them as a VC and then took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level. From the beginning, Elon Musk consistently maintained that Tesla's long-term strategic goal was to create affordable mass-market electric vehicles \"EVs\". Tesla ad Elon musk surprised people with their best EV inventions like tesla autopilot, tesla coil, tesla's upcoming tabless 4680 battery that was a straight answer to Toyota's solid-state battery, tesla's nano and million-mile battery technology, and their upcoming tesla bot \"tesla robot\". Considering all that they even surprised people with the car models like tesla roadster, tesla model s, tesla model 3, tesla model x, tesla model y, tesla's cybertruck, and Elon Musk's very favorite tesla's semi truck. Including Elon Musk's futuristic battery technologies and other technologies these car models tesla roadster, tesla model s, tesla model 3, tesla model x, tesla model y, tesla's cybertruck and elon musk's very favourite tesla's semi truck did great in the EV market.

We've come a long way in our research, but everything we know, all the stars, planets, and galaxies visible today, make up only 4 to 5% of the universe. The universe that we are exploring is unveiling weird objects to us as we move away from the earth. With the help of voyagers, we are farther from the earth and sun than pluto and even entered the interstellar space, discovering the strange space. However, when the voyager continued on its way to the interstellar, it came upon a weird object or barrier that had never been seen anywhere else in this universe before. The scientists are curious to know what that boundary is. Is it protecting our solar system Or is it protecting some other strange world? Welcome to Cosmos lab, your one station for all the news from space. Join us in today\u2019s video to find out about the weird boundary in space.\nIn November 2018, NASA's Voyager 2 accomplished a milestone of exploration by becoming only the second spacecraft ever to explore interstellar space, some six years after its twin, Voyager 1, made the same transition, billions of miles from Earth. Scientists have disclosed what Voyager 2 witnessed as it passed through the intergalactic space, providing new insight into some of our solar system's biggest mysteries.\nIn late 2019 voyager 2 explored a strange boundary between the heliosphere and interstellar space. As the probe continues its voyage, scientists hope to discover more about interstellar space and the remainder of the Milky Way galaxy. Following the probe's entry into interstellar space, scientists examined data obtained throughout the probe's journey from the Sun's major sphere of influence into the emptiness between stars known as the interstellar medium.\nThe heliosphere is the region of space that encompasses the solar system and is influenced by solar winds. The heliopause is the heliosphere's outer boundary, and interstellar space lies beyond it. Solar winds and the magnetic field of the sun are unable to reach interstellar space.\nAs the Voyager left the solar system, scientists got the chance to learn more about the edge of the solar system and the mysterious boundary that separates it from the rest of space. According to a team lead by Edward Stone, a professor of physics at Caltech and project scientist on the Voyager programme since its start in the 1970s, Voyager 2 identified a previously unknown barrier just outside the heliopause.\nThis threshold is called \"cosmic ray boundary layer\" by the researchers because it indicates where the probe encountered a shift in the gradient of cosmic rays from beyond our Sun and lower-energy particles typical of our Sun's familiar environment.\n\nvoyager 2, voyager, voyager mission, voyager discovery, voyager discoveries, space, space telescope, nasa\nThe heliopause is a region that resembles a big bubble and is located around 11 billion miles from the sun. It is the heliosphere and interstellar space's dividing line. The heliopause, on the other hand, isn't a thick, impenetrable barrier. It's more of a porous boundary that permits some particles to get through. Because the boundary allows particles to enter and exit the region, a mix of heliosphere and interstellar space particles is created. Voyager 1 data revealed interstellar particles entering the solar system, whereas Voyager 2 data revealed solar particles leaving. Although Voyager 1 and 2 have expanded knowledge about the heliopause, many questions remain, such as the shape of the region.\nAccording to the researchers, \u201cThere appear to be cosmic ray boundary layers on both sides of the heliopause, with the outer one only being evident at the position of Voyager 2. This cosmic ray boundary layer on the outside of the heliopause was not evident at the place and time where Voyager 1 crossed it.\u201d\nAccording to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, when Voyagers 1 and 2 left the solar system, there was a rapid dropoff in solar particles and a significant rise in galactic radiation. It's unclear why the probes ended up on opposite sides of the heliopause, passing through these layers. It could be related to the Voyagers' divergent paths, with Voyager 1 exiting the heliopause in the northern hemisphere and Voyager 2 escaping from the southern hemisphere.", "date": "Jan 2, 2022", "views": "129,217 views", "comments": "174", "likes": "2,599 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 559.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzsMt0Z4G_M"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkkCZxiD7ZI": {"title": "Cold Case Files: Former Priest Reveals Confession Confirming the Murderer of a Teacher | A&E", "content creator": "A&E", "description": "A former priest divulges information that helps solve a murder case in this clip from Cold Case Files.\n\n#ColdCaseFiles", "date": "Oct 22, 2021", "views": "474,583 views", "comments": "1,004", "likes": "6,505 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 702.301, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkkCZxiD7ZI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aQHL8U1whQ": {"title": "F-35 Lightning High Speed Sneak Pass @ Pensacola Air Show November 6 2021", "content creator": "Joseph Bouza", "description": "", "date": "Nov 6, 2021", "views": "1,543,090 views", "comments": "950", "likes": "7,673 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 29.501, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aQHL8U1whQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3E0t0kGeug": {"title": "How Long Can a Tesla Keep You Warm In A Frozen Traffic Jam? | FUD Debunking", "content creator": "Dirty Tesla", "description": "0:00 - Virginia traffic jam disaster\n0:32 - The experiment setup - heat pump and resistive heater\n2:26 - Two hour check in", "date": "Jan 7, 2022", "views": "904,297 views", "comments": "3,209", "likes": "15,783 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1183.741, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3E0t0kGeug"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42IdOHufsNY": {"title": "And Just Like That (a parody) episode 1", "content creator": "Jimmy Fowlie", "description": "\u201cAnd Just Like That...

They are known for their oyster bar and New England style seafood. In this video we\u2019re getting a first hand look at Union Oyster House, the back end kitchen, and the legendary oyster bar!\n\nFirst of all, I love the old building that actually dates back to way before Union Oyster House opened. There are so many stories that have come out of the amazing building. Union Oyster House opened in 1826, and when you arrive it\u2019s a total step back in time, a living museum that\u2019s a restaurant. \n\nAs you enter Union Oyster House, probably my favorite part of the entire restaurant is the oyster bar, which is the original oyster bar. It wasn\u2019t a seating oyster bar, but rather a leaning oyster bar. And it happened to be a favorite of Daniel Webster who would lean at the bar and eat no fewer than 6 dozen oysters. The oysters were phenomenal, so fresh and local, and with a squeeze of lemon and a swipe of horseradish and cocktail sauce. It was some of the best cocktail sauce I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nAfter taking a full tour of the restaurant we then sat down for a full meal including clam chowder, more oysters, broiled haddock, shrimp with a tomato pesto sauce, and one of my favorite dishes, mussels in white wine, garlic and garlic. The food was fresh and local and prepared in classic New England style. The clam chowder is one of the best I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nUnion Oyster House is an iconic restaurant, it has unparalleled history in the United States, and food is quite delicious - especially the oysters and the clam chowder!

In a few short sentences, it outlines two diametrically opposed modes of being -- both responses to the emergence of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil detailed in story of Adam and Eve. \n\nCain's mode of being -- resentful, arrogant and murderous -- arises because his sacrifices are rejected by God. This means that his attempts to give up something valuable in the present to ensure prosperity in the future are insufficient. He fails, in consequence, to thrive, as he believes he should, and becomes bitter, resentful and murderous.\n\nAbel's mode of being is characterized, by contrast, by proper sacrifice -- by the establishment of balance between present action and future benefit. This ensures his personal and social success, accruing over time. Unfortunately, it also makes him the target of Cain's malevolence.\n\nThis great short story is relevant personally, on the level of the family, and politically, all with equal force, all simultaneously. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

This era followed the Renaissance music era, and was followed in turn by the Classical era. Baroque music forms a major portion of the \"classical music\" canon, and is now widely studied, performed, and listened to. Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Pachelbel.\n\nThe Baroque period saw the creation of common-practice tonality, an approach to writing music in which a song or piece is written in a particular key; this kind of arrangement has continued to be used in almost all Western popular music. During the Baroque era, professional musicians were expected to be accomplished improvisers of both solo melodic lines and accompaniment parts. Baroque concerts were typically accompanied by a basso continuo group (comprising chord-playing instrumentalists such as harpsichordists and lute players improvising chords from a figured bass part) while a group of bass instruments\u2014viol, cello, double bass\u2014played the bassline. A characteristic Baroque form was the dance suite. While the pieces in a dance suite were inspired by actual dance music, dance suites were designed purely for listening, not for accompanying dancers.\n\nDuring the period, composers and performers used more elaborate musical ornamentation (typically improvised by performers), made changes in musical notation (the development of figured bass as a quick way to notate the chord progression of a song or piece), and developed new instrumental playing techniques. Baroque music expanded the size, range, and complexity of instrumental performance, and also established the mixed vocal/instrumental forms of opera, cantata and oratorio and the instrumental forms of the solo concerto and sonata as musical genres. Many musical terms and concepts from this era, such as toccata, fugue and concerto grosso are still in use in the 2010s. Dense, complex polyphonic music, in which multiple independent melody lines were performed simultaneously (a popular example of this is the fugue), was an important part of many Baroque choral and instrumental works.\n\nThe term \"baroque\" comes from the Portuguese word barroco, meaning \"misshapen pearl\". Negative connotations of the term first occurred in 1734, in a criticism of an opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau, and later (1750) in a description by Charles de Brosses of the ornate and heavily ornamented architecture of the Pamphili Palace in Rome; and from Jean Jacques Rousseau in 1768 in the Encyclop\u00e9die in his criticism of music that was overly complex and unnatural. Although the term continued to be applied to architecture and art criticism through the 19th century, it was not until the 20th century that the term \"baroque\" was adopted from Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin's art-history vocabulary to designate a historical period in music.", "date": "Oct 25, 2017", "views": "5,572,154 views", "comments": "1,556", "likes": "45,963 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 21155.101, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gfIDSreaV0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqCTkRgsqW8": {"title": "Jordan Peterson on Jesus Christ, Christianity and What It Means to Have Faith | Jordan Peterson 2022", "content creator": "Remember Truth", "description": "Jordan Peterson Talks about Jesus Christ and what it means to have faith.\n\nJordan B Peterson shares his conviction and testimony of Jesus Christ.

Jussie claims he was jumped and assaulted by two Donald Trump supporters, in the early morning hours of January 29, 2019, right outside his Chicago apartment (North Water Apartments). Initially, the media (CNN, TMZ, Fox News, MSNBC), Hollywood (Ellen Page, Lee Daniels, The View, The Talk, The Real), and presidential candidates (Cory Booker, Kamala Harris) gave Jussie an outpouring of support and seemed to have condemned Trump Make America Great Again (MAGA) supporters.\n\nHowever, after an elaborate investigation, police (Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson) believe they have irrefutable evidence that Jussie Smollett is not a victim, but a perpetrator filing a false police report on a fake hate crime attack to gain publicity so he can demand a higher salary on his TV show. Despite all the police evidence against Jussie, including his \"attackers\" (Abel and Ola Osundairo) cooperating with Chicago Police, Jussie is still claiming his innocence. So we\u2019re going to investigate by reading his body language during this famous Good Morning America (GMA) interview with Robin Roberts, and using police evidence, to determine if Jussie Smollett is lying.\n\nIf you think Jussie Smollett is guilty of staging the attack, give this video a thumbs up.\n\nIf you think Jussie Smollett is not guilty, then give this video a thumbs down.\n\nIn the comments: what punishment, if any, do you think Jussie Smollett should receive? Let everyone know in the comments below.\n\nRemember to subscribe for more body language and investigative videos and I\u2019ll see you at the top.\n\nMENTIONED POLICE BODY CAMERA VIDEO:\nWatch How Police Caught Chris Watts, Family Murderer, With Body Language - Police Body Cameras", "date": "Feb 28, 2019", "views": "2,168,300 views", "comments": "19,094", "likes": "60,763 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2002.781, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH7IalJyMjk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1rD7s4dShk": {"title": "Pawn Stars: \u201cHappy Wife, Happy Life\u201d (7 Husbands\u2019 Sweetheart Deals) | History", "content creator": "Pawn Stars", "description": "Watch all new episodes of Pawn Stars, returning Monday, March 22 at 9/8c, and stay up to date on all of your favorite The HISTORY Channel shows at https://history.com/schedule.\n\nCheck out this Pawn Stars compilation featuring 7 sweetheart deals that will warm your heart!

Thanks for watching!\n\n\nAbout the video: The following describes what has been done in making this video. First, we decide on the topic of our video. Second, we listen to the relevant lectures, interviews, and Q&As that contain the necessary audio to cover the chosen title. Then the audios are trimmed and merged to make one audio which is then edited to improve audibility. We do our best to preserve the context of these audios to avoid misinterpretation and misunderstanding. We, also give the context of the video above. We then add background music that can march the tone of the information. Relevant stock footage is added to provide a visual perception of the information. Our footage is licensed through Envato Elements, Artgrid, Filmpac, and Storyblocks. Thereafter we add different transition effects between footages to make the video seamless and cinematic depending on the tone. For strong messages we make text effects using after effects to emphasize these points. The final part is to write subtitles for the whole video and to give it a good font and font size. The video is then exported and uploaded.\nWe finally make our thumbnail using Adobe photoshop which involves using different layers of images, text, and solid colors.\n\nSpeaker: Dr.Jordan B Peterson\n                : Lewis Howes\n\nlink to the full interview:", "date": "Sep 6, 2021", "views": "915,007 views", "comments": "434", "likes": "32,355 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 728.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpAp1YNbuGg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJtD1esmgxA": {"title": "How to know your future spouse", "content creator": "Jerome V.", "description": "Know if you can negotiate with them...\nstarted to formulate a vision of your joint future that you can both look forward to with enthusiasm and confidence\n...joint production and care of children..\n...Sets you up for the rest of your life! \n..What else are you going to do when you're 55?  \nOriginal source: ", "date": "Jul 31, 2017", "views": "2,238,095 views", "comments": "2,316", "likes": "57,330 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 493.741, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJtD1esmgxA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByTwJDQD2P4": {"title": "When flight attendants from different airlines see each other \ud83e\udd2a #shorts", "content creator": "Jeenie.Weenie", "description": "", "date": "Jun 20, 2021", "views": "10,310,948 views", "comments": "3,182", "likes": "897,932 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 18.561, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByTwJDQD2P4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErbdafVWSoE": {"title": "Part 1 - Jon Stewart Takes The Colbert Questionert", "content creator": "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert", "description": "On the eve of the premiere of his new Apple TV+ show, \"The Problem with Jon Stewart,\" our dear friend Jon stops by and agrees to undergo Stephen Colbert's patent-pending personal survey known around the world as The Colbert Questionert.

The state collects massive amounts of data from willing citizens: the benefits are practical, and people who play by the rules are rewarded.\n\nCritics call it \"the most ambitious Orwellian project in human history.\" China's digital surveillance system involves massive amounts of data being gathered by the state. In the so-called \"brain\" of Shanghai, for example, authorities have an eye on everything. On huge screens, they can switch to any of the approximately one million cameras, to find out who\u2019s falling asleep behind the wheel, or littering, or not following Coronavirus regulations. \"We want people to feel good here, to feel that the city is very safe,\" says Sheng Dandan, who helped design the \"brain.\" Surveys suggest that most Chinese citizens are inclined to see benefits as opposed to risks: if algorithms can identify every citizen by their face, speech and even the way they walk, those breaking the law or behaving badly will have no chance. It\u2019s incredibly convenient: a smartphone can be used to accomplish just about any task, and playing by the rules leads to online discounts thanks to a social rating system. \n\nThat's what makes Big Data so attractive, and not just in China.

I describe more than a dozen protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness, improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and our mental focus generally). I also explain how to use eyesight to improve our levels of alertness and why visual hallucinations, lazy eyes and colorblindness occur. I also describe various compounds that may assist in supporting visual health and possibly improve our vision.

Acorn and Pumpkin were having another noisy fight. Usually this stops with aggressive sounds like teeth chattering, but today Acorn was ready to attack to defend her food. Despite being a small pig, she mustered a mighty jumping bite that can only be witnessed in super slow motion. Pumpkin never saw it coming.\n\nIn response, Zucchin decides it's time to flee, taking an entire leaf for herself. Butternut just seems confused as usual.\n\nDon't worry, the pigs are OK and getting along since their fight! If anything, Pumpkin is just embarrassed she got tackled in front of the whole herd. Guinea pigs have minor fights while bonding to establish dominance and set the pecking order. Acorn is growing and getting stronger so she's restarting old fights to advance in the pig rankings.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S PIGS?\n\nWe publish daily highlights of the adorable antics of our guinea pig herd. Subscribe to see what they do tomorrow!\n\nIn June 2019 we adopted five pigs from Los Angeles Guinea Pig Rescue. They are cute herbivorous pets with funny social interactions. We film all their behaviors, from cute guinea pig noises to eating sounds, playing with their food to sleeping with their eyes open, and occasional fighting. So far they have been most popular for their loud wheeking and rumblestrutting and their ridiculous guinea pig fights!\n\nOur videos generally have no talking so they're great in any language, whether you search for guinea pigs as cobayos, conejillos de indias, cochons d'Inde, meerschweinchen, mor\u010de, marsvin, cavia, marsu, tengerimalac, marmot, porcellino d'India, cobaia, gine domuzu, chu\u1ed9t b\u1ea1ch, \u015bwinka morska, \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430, \u062e\u0648\u06a9\u0686\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u062f\u06cc ,\u062e\u0646\u0632\u064a\u0631 \u063a\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0627, \u8c5a\u9f20, \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8, \uae30\ub2c8\ud53c\uadf8, or \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39\u0e15\u0e30\u0e40\u0e20\u0e32!\n\nMEET THE PIG FAMILY\n\nSpaghett is the boar of the herd. The rest of the pigs are females, but he\u2019s a neutered male so they won\u2019t be breeding. Sorry, no pregnant or baby guinea pigs! Spaghett has orange-brown fur with a white crest on his head and cute red eyes. He goes on morning romps with entertaining popcorning and zoomies. He does a hilarious rumblestrutting dance for the ladies while purring. When pigs argue he trots over to comfort them. He burrows through hay and stands on his back feet like a goofy dinosaur.\n\nAcorn is youngest so we call her little Acorn. She has white, black, and gold fur with a cute mousy face. She\u2019s inquisitive, always wants food, and talks to herself while exploring hay piles. She\u2019s always the last one eating while the others nap. Little Acorn\u2019s special talent is jumping on houses to go on rooftop adventures.\n\nButternut appears either confused or deep in thought, but we speculate she is just a very philosophical pig. She has white and gold fur. She\u2019s the lowest ranking pig so she stares into space while waiting for other pigs to move. Her hobbies include sleeping and yawning while flopped over with her feet sprawled out. She continues wheeking and squeaking at us after we have already given her food.\n\nPumpkin has black fur except for white back toes. She looks like a cow, a non-guinea pig, and a rabbit. She has noisy standoffs with little Acorn when Acorn gets too feisty. Pumpkin seems receptive to Spaghett\u2019s rumblestrutting and occasionally she chases him around instead.\n\nZucchin is oldest and grumpiest. She has white and gray fur with cute red eyes. At first Zucchin fought with Spaghett. There were teeth chattering, nose raising, and hair puffing battles. Now they get along, but Zucchin is still a grouch. Her main hobby is being an eel and lunging at anyone who comes near. She likes to chase other pigs out of their homes, then follow them to another home and chase them out of that one too. But she looks like a cute rat!\n\nTHEIR HOME\n\nThe pigs live in a custom 4 by 6 foot cage made by merging 3 MidWest Guinea Habitat cages. We cut the seams of the cage bottoms and joined them into one large cage liner. Now we have a triple size MidWest cage! The pigs first lived in the 3 cages connected by ramps.\n\nThe bedding is fleece blankets with towels underneath and newspaper on the bottom. Each day we change one third of the bedding and spot clean several times.\n\nThe pigs prefer free stuff to actual guinea pig toys. They love to hide under packing paper. A DIY guinea pig house made from a cardboard box is a favorite hidey. They are not interested in most chew toys.\n\nTHEIR DIET\n\nTheir favorite hay is 3rd cut timothy hay from Small Pet Select. They gobble up guinea pig pellets.\n\nThey eat nearly any vegetable. The only thing rejected so far was zucchini. Their favorites are parsley, kale, collard greens, kohlrabi, carrot tops and roots, beets, bell peppers, corn with the husk, and cucumbers. They go nuts for homemade wheatgrass sprouts.", "date": "Jul 26, 2019", "views": "3,024,152 views", "comments": "4,767", "likes": "83,922 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 80.841, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcAjGYky4OA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZhSLAvNI_A": {"title": "JE DEVIENS YOUTUBER (\u00e7a tourne mal) - Youtuber's Life 2 Ep1", "content creator": "Bazar du Grenier", "description": "\"Salut YouTube on est sur Youtube.\"\n- Frederic Molas, 2022", "date": "Jan 15, 2022", "views": "425,738 views", "comments": "1,320", "likes": "20,173 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2982.361, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZhSLAvNI_A"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z39Zbpb9yU": {"title": "Mayday Ship Sinking! | Coast Guard Alaska | Full Episode", "content creator": "DangerTV", "description": "Coast Guard Alaska follows the men and women of the US Coast Guard stationed in Alaska.
