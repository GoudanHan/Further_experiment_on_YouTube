It makes billions of people around the world ask, What is Hinduism? Some say it isn\u2019t even a religion, more a way of life. Hindus themselves call it San\u0101tana Dharma, the eternal tradition. So what is Hinduism, does YOLO apply to them, and who is that elephant god?\n\nHinduism is the world's oldest active religion. It's the result of the merging of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation and nomads that came into India around 1500BC. Some scholars say it could even go back many more thousands of years.\n\nHinduism has a long long history. But today we'll be focusing just on the core beliefs of Hindus because I don't have the willpower to animate a 3-hour video.\n\nHinduism is so diverse, so deep, and means so many different things to different people. Learning even the basics of this fascinating and ancient religion gives us an insight into the worldview of over a billion people.\n\n\nFollow me on twitter", "date": "Jul 13, 2019", "views": "3,374,500 views", "comments": "33,675", "likes": "149,259 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1071.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlBEEuYIWwY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUUjpyMk360": {"title": "F 35 near sonic boom", "content creator": "Porsche Blox", "description": "F 35 vapor cone that looks similar to sonic boom (I keep getting comments about how it didn't actually break the sound barrier but I just put the title as \"near\" sonic boom because it almost looks like one even though its just a vapor cone) #supersonic #sonicboom #aviation #f35 #usaf #jets ", "date": "Oct 3, 2021", "views": "1,699,742 views", "comments": "1,115", "likes": "19,637 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 12.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUUjpyMk360"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UhVwaPfhHM": {"title": "Polar Bear Encounter", "content creator": "ourtrips2go", "description": "Near Churchill, Canada", "date": "Nov 13, 2015", "views": "11,220,624 views", "comments": "24,822", "likes": "326,161 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 25.201, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UhVwaPfhHM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gaqSGTxF6U": {"title": "COUNTRIES SCALED BY INTERNET SPEED | Countryballs Animation", "content creator": "PWA", "description": "199 Mbps?!

Nearly every major automaker has announced a transition to electric vehicles, Tesla delivered almost one million cars in 2021, and electric vehicle companies like Rivian and Lucid are rolling new models off the line.\n\nIn order to power all of these EVs, we will need batteries, lots of them. Electric vehicle growth will be responsible for more than 90% of demand for lithium by 2030, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. But lithium is also in our phones, computers, ceramics, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, and is essential for solar and wind energy storage. This vital mineral in rechargeable batteries has earned the name \u201cwhite gold\u201d and the rush is on.\n\nBut today, the U.S. is far behind, with only 1% of global lithium being mined and processed in the U.S., according to the USGS. More than 80% of the world\u2019s raw lithium is mined in Australia, Chile, and China. And China controls more than half of the world\u2019s lithium processing and refining and has three fourths of the lithium-ion battery megafactories in the world, according to the International Energy Agency. There is only one operating lithium mine in the U.S., Albemarle\u2019s Silver Peak, Nevada.\n\nBut that could be changing. Last June, the Biden administration released a blueprint for jumpstarting domestic lithium production and refining as well as battery manufacturing, and set a national EV sales goal of 50% by 2030.\n\nAnd there are several domestic lithium projects in the works in Nevada, North Carolina, California and Arkansas, to name a few.\n\nControlled Thermal Resources is developing a lithium project at the Salton Sea in California. Last summer, GM announced a multi-million-dollar investment in Controlled Thermal Resources, and has secured first rights to purchase the domestically produced lithium for its EVs.\n\nPiedmont Lithium wants to revive an old lithium mining area in North Carolina, near Charlotte. Piedmont signed a deal in 2020 to supply Tesla with lithium sourced from its deposits there, but the project has hit delays due to permitting.\n\nLithium Americas plans an open-pit mine at Thacker Pass, which is located about 200 miles north of Reno, Nevada, and is one of the largest lithium reserves in the U.S. \n\nBut no one wants a mine in their backyard, and Thacker Pass and other projects have been plagued with lawsuits and opposition from environmentalists, permitting delays and opposition from Native American tribes in the area.\n\nWatch the video to learn more, and to get an inside look at some of the domestic lithium projects in the works.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ", "date": "Jan 15, 2022", "views": "286,495 views", "comments": "1,089", "likes": "4,799 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 981.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epceXRIxkM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pwho7C5-OY": {"title": "Chris Hayes: People Get Indicted For A Lot Less Than What Trump Has Done", "content creator": "MSNBC", "description": "MSNBC's Chris Hayes compares the indictment of Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby and the evidence of corruption surrounding Donald Trump.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: ", "date": "Jan 14, 2022", "views": "244,644 views", "comments": "1,720", "likes": "6,094 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 287.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pwho7C5-OY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riUb2Trxktg": {"title": "FOREVER AND EVER", "content creator": "The Potters House Footscray", "description": "Ps Chris Plummer THE POTTERS HOUSE FOOTSCRAY Sun 16th January 2022 10:30am   \nSubscribe to receive our latest messages: footscraychurch/youtube/videos\nTo support this ministry and help us continue to reach people all around the world click here:", "date": "Streamed live on Jan 15, 2022", "views": "196 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "Unavailable", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4476.601, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riUb2Trxktg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIx0_wsHwgM": {"title": "Gravitas: End of the road for Boris Johnson?", "content creator": "WION", "description": "British lawmakers are asking Boris Johnson to resign after he admitted to attending a Downing Street party during lockdown.

The China-Russia-Canada-America line would be the most expensive megaproject in history and take years to complete. The biggest engineering challenge would be building an underwater tunnel through the Bering Strait. The Bering Strait would be the longest underwater tunnel in the world and cost about $52 billion to build. There are other significant hurdles that China must overcome if it hopes to build a high-speed rail line to the United States. Money is no issue but there are environmental concerns and political concerns. The United States and China have a very strained relationship and tensions would have to decrease significantly if the China-Russia-Canada-America line were to become a reality. China\u2019s high-speed rail network has grown significantly in the last 20 years. Today, the country has one of the most comprehensive high-speed rail networks on the planet and new projects are being completed every year. State-owned China Railway began planning the country\u2019s high-speed rail system in 1990. In 1999, China began construction on the first leg of its high-speed rail network, the Qinhuangdao\u2013Shenyang Passenger Railway. The $1.9 billion rail line began service in 2003, and bullet trains that run on the line now reach top speeds of 160 mph. Construction then increased exponentially. In 2012, China opened the 1,428-mile-long Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed rail line. It\u2019s the longest high-speed rail line in the world and has reduced the travel time between Beijing and Guangzhou to just eight hours. Here\u2019s a look at China\u2019s plan for an underwater train to the United States.\n\n\n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com\n\nCHAPTERS:", "date": "Mar 19, 2021", "views": "1,440,214 views", "comments": "3,812", "likes": "19,075 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 480.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzl11OAg-mE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDNgQzPIV-A": {"title": "Abandoned - Chicago Spire", "content creator": "Bright Sun Films", "description": "The first 1000 people to use the link will get a free trial of Skillshare Premium Membership: https://skl.sh/brightsunfilms02211", "date": "Feb 5, 2021", "views": "1,619,145 views", "comments": "3,017", "likes": "37,443 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 946.901, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDNgQzPIV-A"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt_HNFI4ckY": {"title": "Videos show flooding, damage after tsunami waves hit San Francisco Bay Area", "content creator": "ABC7 News Bay Area", "description": "An undersea volcano erupted in near the Pacific nation of Tonga, sending tsunami waves crashing across the shore and people rushing to higher ground.

The renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explains in detail the multiverse hypothesis. \n\nHowever, prominent physicists are divided about whether any other universes exist outside of our own. Some even go as far as to say that the multiverse is not a legitimate topic of scientific inquiry. Because it can not be empirically falsified. But Neil deGrasse Tyson among other prominent cosmologists, thinks that given our understanding of quantum mechanics and the theory of General relativity, the possibility of the existence of the multiverse is a legitimate scientific hypothesis. \n\nSteven Weinberg said that if the multiverse existed, the hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our Big Bang is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we live.\n\nSome scientists analyzed the data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, an uncrewed spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 that measured temperature differences across the sky in the cosmic microwave background, the radiant heat remaining from the Big Bang, and claimed they found evidence suggesting that our universe collided with other parallel universes in the distant past.\n\nHowever, a more thorough data analysis from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and from the Planck Satellite, a space observatory operated by the European Space Agency from 2009 to 2013, which mapped the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, did not find any statistically significant evidence of universe collisions. there was no evidence of any gravitational pull of other universes on ours either. And to add insult to injury to the proponents that the multiverse hypothesis has been backed up by statistical evidence, the Planck satellite, has a resolution three times higher than the WMA Probe.\n\n\nOur brains are not evolutionarily equipped to intuitively understand quantum mechanics and large scale cosmic phenomena. But Neil deGrasse Tyson with his usual wits explains the multiverse hypothesis in layman's terms.
