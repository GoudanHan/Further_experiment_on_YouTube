Kennedy. But before Oswald died, he claimed that a damning piece of evidence against him \u2014 a photo showing Oswald holding the rifle that killed the president \u2014 was fake. In fact, he said his face was superimposed onto another person\u2019s body to set him up. \n\nThe photo\u2019s authenticity has been in question ever since, and it plays a key role in the conspiracy theory surrounding JFK\u2019s death. The shadows in the photo seem inconsistent, and Oswald\u2019s crooked stance under the weight of the rifle looks like he is about to tip over. Plus, his face doesn\u2019t look the same as it does in his mug shot. \n\nFor decades, conspiracy theorists have used this image as key evidence to suggest that Oswald was framed. But decades of analysis \u2014 including recent 3D forensic analysis \u2014 has proved over and over that the photo is likely authentic. \n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story.

And today we will be showing off how to Become a god In Skyrim using an easy video game exploit to generate infinite gold and experience by levelling pick pocketing at a incredible rate. The Spiffing Brit will be seeing if Skyrim Is A perfectly balanced game with no exploits by becoming Todd Howard and stealing important quest items to gain access to an infinite source of gold. He will also be using Item duplication and Infinite Money Glitches to become a god in Skyrim. With Elder Scrolls 6 / ESVI  being announced not too long ago I have excellent plans for exploiting that games release but to keep my desire to become a god in Elder Scrolls sated I have decided to see if it is possible to try and start Becoming God With Gold. One thing is for certain this game Is Broken!!\n\nSo sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Skyrim Special Edition is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if the Becoming God Challenge is broken!! How can you even Become a god in Skyrim without doing a Quest! What strange RPG game exploit is this! Unlimited gold thanks to a gold exploit!\n\nThis video game exploit video will be jam packed with a best bits funny moments montage style of editing similar to that of Valefisk, Robbaz and RTgame.

In Their divine wisdom they gave the players of skyrim the most overpowered mage build in terms of damage outputs in skyrim. We took the strongest spell in skyrim and decided to see if we could also add it to our 100% resistant to magic build that we would need to do the absorb Magic Only challenge again! AND THEN add an additional 12,000% damage to that spell thanks to the fortify restoration loop exploit!   So how on earth can a player beat skyrim with only a 100% Resistance To Magic a skill which is exceedingly limited and has few overpowered gameplay features alongside the most overpowered mage build in the universe... You can take a level 1 character and turn them into the most powerful character in the entirety of the elder scrolls universe by having them become immune to magic and have magic powers that can evaporate a dragon in 1 second. So lets see if The Spiffing Brit can prove if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game or if spiff can exploit skyrim and beat the game with only Magic. \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this Skyrim Magic only challenge! How on earth can one english bugger beat Skyrim Special Edition with only resisting spells and using the most powerful lightening imaginable!! Its the most overpowered build yet!  Is it really a Magic Challenge... I mean there is not much of a challenge when you can 1 hit every single enemy...\n\nmajestic merch: ", "date": "Aug 2, 2020", "views": "3,269,406 views", "comments": "3,844", "likes": "104,263 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2086.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ONaXTtjGw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z48Z1LdyM-U": {"title": "How to Get Gold Fast and Easy in Skyrim | 100,000+ Gold/Hour", "content creator": "TheLeuzR", "description": "Hello everyone!

Because these emergencies will define our entire lifetime, and at present are still getting worse. Thus, while a healthy reaction to grief over a lost loved one is to grieve deeply and then gradually to recover, there is no 'recovery' from ecological grief. The only recovery from it that is possible at all is for us to change the world such that it no longer keeps deteriorating. This is how eco-grief, grief at the tearing from us of what we love and are not willing to do without, leads into radical eco-action. When we finally allow ourselves to face the full terrible reality of what our species is doing to our home, our kin and our very future, then, to avoid getting stuck in depression or despair, there is no alternative but to struggle. This is how grief expresses and powers the love that is the one thing that might yet save our future from being - to vary Orwell - a boot stamping on the faces of all beings (humans included) forever.\n\nThere is a vast 'mental-health crisis' coming. Those suffering from eco-grief are in the vanguard of it. This crisis \u2014 a pandemic of grief, depression and plain terror that will rise in intensity as the world\u2019s citizens wake up to the slow death-march that their \u2018leaders\u2019 and the world\u2019s rich and powerful are laying on for them \u2014 may yet, however, be the making of us. For what powers rebellion is facing the terrible truth of the decaying future we/they have manufactured; what enables us to face up to that truth, after we work through denial and depression, is our grief. Because grief is an expression, above all, of a profound love.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nRupert Read is a professor of philosophy at the University of East Anglia.

Learning to interpret your cat\u2019s tail signs will give you greater insight to your kitty-cat\u2019s moods and feelings, and is sure to improve your bond with your pet.\n\nIn this video, we will break down different feline tail positions and explain what your cat is trying to tell you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn upright tail\nWhen cats hold their tail straight up, it means that they are happy and confident. \nYou'll often see this tail position when you come home after a long day at work, or when a kitten greets her mother. \nInterestingly, a research study conducted by Cameron-Beaumont in 1997 found that cats were willing to readily approach a cat-shaped silhouette if it had a raised tail, but they were very reluctant to approach the silhouette if it had a lowered tail.\nTail-up therefore seems to signal the intention that the cat is friendly and wants to interact with you or other cats. \nWrapping their tails around you\nWhen your cat wraps their tail around you or others, they are trying to show love, relaxation and affection.\nThis tail stance essentially symbolizes friendship and love, similar to how humans wrap their arms around loved ones for a warm hug. \nA cat may also wrap their tail around the tail of another cat. This is a sign that the two felines are friendly and have a strong bond. \nA quivering tail\nA \u201cQuiver\u201d is a rapid, tiny cat tail wagging action. More often than not, cats quiver their tail when they are very excited, like when you open a new can of cat food. It is a friendly greeting and indicates your cat is happy. \nBut remember, if a cat quivers their tail while holding their tail straight up and backing up against a vertical surface, then that cat is urine marking. Although both female and male cats spray a concentrated mix of urine, unneutered males are more likely to leave their mark to let the opposite sex know they're available. \nA puffed-up tail\nWhile some people think a puffed-up tail indicates aggression, it doesn\u2019t. \nA cat that fluffs up their tail is usually frightened or threatened. By puffing up, your cat is trying to appear bigger and more threatening to their opponent. \nTail held low\nA lower tail often indicates your cat is frightened, anxious, afraid or defensive. Something in the cat's environment is making them uneasy. \nAnd when the cat tucks their tail all the way under the body and between their legs, it is an unmistakable indicator that the cat is feeling nervous, submissive or frightened.\nTwitching the end of the tail\nTail twitching is similar to tail wagging but often involves lots of flicks of the tail at its tip. Cats twitch the end of their tails when they are hunting or actively playing with a toy, as well as when they are mildly or frustrated or irritated. \nTail swaying slowly from side to side\nThis is when a cat moves its entire tail  slowly from side to side.\nMore often than not, a slow swaying tail indicates that the cat is deeply concentrating on something, or is engaged in predatory behavior. \nA Thumping Tail\nYou may think cats are as happy as dogs when they wag their tail, but they aren\u2019t.\nA tail that whips quickly back and forth with more ferocity than a graceful swishing, or one that thumps loudly against the floor indicates that a cat is unhappy, agitated or fearful. The angrier the cat is, the faster they thrash their tail back and forth. \nA Question Mark Tail\nYou have probably noticed that your cat\u2019s tail sometimes looks like a question mark\u2014it stands upright and curls at the tip. This tail position often indicates that your cat is happy and friendly.\nSymbolic of the question mark shape that it represents, this position can also mean that your cat is feeling curious about something. \nTail up at a 45-degree angle\nA tail held out behind but angled up may mean your cat is unsure how to feel right now. They\u2019re neither welcoming nor threatening. \nCurling their tails around their bodies\nIf your cat is sitting or lying down with their tail curled tightly around their body, it means they are fearful, defensive, nervous, or feeling uncomfortable. \nTail hanging down with a curve\nIf your cat\u2019s tail is hanging down with a dip near the base, it\u2019s a sign that your feline friend is mildly afraid, or a little defensive. Remember, the lower a cat\u2019s tail is, the more anxious or afraid they are. And all in all, a tail below the level of their back indicates some negative feelings.\nAlthough the tail is the most expressive part of a cat\u2019s body language, you should look at more than just their tail movements to fully understand their emotional state. Better understanding your cat\u2019s body language will surely improve your bond with your feline.\nBe sure to check our other videos to learn more about cat vocalizations, quirks and body language.", "date": "Oct 14, 2021", "views": "239,122 views", "comments": "192", "likes": "5,413 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 545.101, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tURs6OlKcvw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt_xrcYJZRg": {"title": "Little Kitten, Loud Purr!", "content creator": "Teddy Eeva", "description": "Hear me Purr!

Curled-up\nIn the curled-up position, the cat curls its tail around its body and tucks its head towards the chest. This resting position means that your cat might be trying to conserve body heat and provide protection to the fundamental parts of its body. It\u2019s the most common sleeping position for animals in the wild, too, as it helps conserve warmth and protects the vital organs. \n \n#2.     A Cat in a Box\n \nA cat in a box position means that your cat is worried about its security and is seeking comfort and protection. When cats sleep in smaller, congested areas, this shows their concern about safety. The solid walls of a box make them feel secure by providing them with a tight and secure space. Other than boxes, cats may also seek out drawers, bowls, and other objects that they can fit tightly into. Maybe your cat is scared of other pets or children in the household.  You can help her out by creating an enclosed box with sufficient fluffiness inside to help her sleep comfortably.\n\n \n#3.     Belly up Position\n \nA cat\u2019s stomach is its most vulnerable area. So, if your cat is sleeping in a belly-up position in which the legs are pointed at weird angles while the stomach is facing the ceiling, this is a sign that the cat feels comfortable and safe in your home. You can consider yourself lucky that you\u2019ve won the trust of your fluffy pet. That\u2019s because, cats are usually concerned about their safety and won\u2019t expose their vulnerable parts when they aren\u2019t sure about their surroundings. Sleeping on their back is an indication that your pet is confident and relaxed with its surroundings.\n\n\n#4.     The Half-Eye Shut Position\n \nOne thing about predators is that they hunt and do not like to get hunted in return. \nThis is the reason that your cat is not closing its eyes all the way even though it is dozing off.\nIn this position, you will notice that your cat\u2019s ears are constantly moving, which means your pet is alert. This shallow form of sleep can last for hours. Your pet is aware of what is going on in its surroundings, and any unusual sound will jolt the cat into complete attention.\nIn another version of this position, the cat sleeps with one eye shut and the other open. This is called Unihemispheric Slow-wave Sleep. In this form, half of the brain is in unconscious while the other half is conscious and alert.\nThis form of sleeping is beneficial because your cat can rest even in places with some sense of threat.\n\n#5.     The Loaf Position\n \nIn this position, the cat sits upright but tucks its front paws under the body. If you find your cat sleeping in a loaf-like position, this means your cat does not want to sleep for long and is only resting before the next activity. \n \n\n#6.     Sleeping Sideways\n \nSleeping sideways is an extremely relaxing sleeping position for a cat. Sleeping on one side with their limbs stretched out means that your cat is fully content and feeling safe. Your cat is in total relaxation mode and does not feel the need to remain alert. Cats fall into a deep sleep in this position.\n \n#7.     Paw Above the Face Position\n \nPaw-over-face is one of the most adorable sleeping positions common to cats which will leave you surprised at most times. \nWhen the cat puts a paw across the face, it signals that they don\u2019t wish to be disturbed.\nThis generally happens when the cat is sleeping soundly and unknowingly. This position also occurs when a bright light or the daylight is making the cat feel uncomfortable and so they cover their eyes as a result. \n \n#8.     Monorail Cat\n \nMonorail position is when the cat lies on the arms or backs of chairs, sofas, staircase banisters, fence posts, or the tops of doors. Typically, the cat dangles down all four legs in this position. This position is called the \u201cmonorail\u201d because the posture of the cat is such that it resembles a monorail transit system. \nCats have zero understanding of architectural rules regarding access and functionality. They like to rest in this position as it is more suitable for general surveillance\n \n#9.     The Contortionist\n\nA cat in the contortionist position, will sleep all twisted up with their limbs hanging in different directions while her head is twisted at weird angles. There is no particular reason behind this position and your cat might only choose it because it is comforting to them at the time. \n \nSo, there you have it, all the most important and commonly observed cat sleeping positions lined up for you. You can now easily understand all those untold signals and signs that your cat cannot tell you themselves. You can find out whether your cat is feeling secure or threatened and if they are sleeping comfortably or not.", "date": "Jan 17, 2020", "views": "7,660,422 views", "comments": "7,132", "likes": "165,806 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 346.381, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62BrXWxljL8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INhgQKMB1cU": {"title": "12 Things Cats Hate the Most", "content creator": "Jaw-Dropping Facts", "description": "In this video, we\u2019ll discuss the top 12 things cats hate that you should avoid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#1. High-pitched Sounds\nWhile cats hear low-pitched noises about as well as we do, they can pick up high-pitched sounds much better than humans. Their range goes even beyond that of dogs.\nHigh-pitched noises to cats can come in ways you would not expect. Ambulance sirens, loud music, hair dryers, vacuum cleaners, or even your phone\u2019s ringtone are some of the high-pitched sounds that cats hate. This is another reason that we should never shout at our kitties as this only causes stress and anxiety. \n\n#2. Low Temperatures\nCats like temperatures of 20 degrees higher than human\u2019s ideal temperature. In fact, a cat\u2019s coat isn\u2019t made to protect them from low temperatures. On the contrary, their coat protects their delicate skin from extreme heat.  \n\n#3. Water\nWhile you may think cats need a bath, they don\u2019t. Unlike dogs, cats bathe themselves. And think of the Great Sphinx of Giza. Many modern domestic cat breeds come from arid countries around the Middle East or Asia. No one really knows, but the theory is that a lack of water in their breeding makes them intolerant of getting wet. \nHowever, here is another piece of advice. A cat likes to have fresh water to drink at their own leisure. This means that you have to put out fresh water for your feline every day in a clean dish. If they don\u2019t drink enough water your cat can get a urinary tract infection.\n#4. Surprises\nYou probably have watched videos of cats getting scared of cucumbers, but what actually happens is that your cat isn\u2019t afraid of the cucumber itself, but it is the fact that the cucumber appeared next to them without they noticing it. Cats tend to be scared of the unknown, as it could represent a danger or predator, and in the case of a cucumber, a snake. \nAlthough some may find it funny, surprises cause anxiety and fear in your cat. It\u2019s best to look for other ways to have fun with your pet. \n\n#5. Stale Food\nYou may think that dry or wet food lasts for several days, but it doesn\u2019t. Cats will eat fresh food that is newly opened. But they won\u2019t touch it after that. Cats need to eat daily, but not in the same way as dogs do. If your cat is picking at their food, they are telling you they don\u2019t like it because it may be stale. \nOr they don\u2019t like the flavor. \n\n#6. Dirty Litter Box\nCats are extremely clean animals and they devote a large portion of their day for self-grooming. \nThey hate dirty litter box, grimy toys, or unclean water bowl. \nCleaning your cat\u2019s litter box every day will make for a happy cat that loves to use the bathroom in the right place.  \n\n\n#7. Certain Smells\nOne of the smells that cats can\u2019t tolerate is gasoline. This is why if you take your cat to the vet, make sure the tank is filled beforehand. Cats also can\u2019t tolerate the smell of onion or vinegar. \nBut there\u2019s more. Menthol, wintergreen, and mint are also scents cats can\u2019t handle. But before we give you a break, there are more scents a cat will hide away from. That\u2019s lavender, citrus, rue, rosemary, mint, and cinnamon. \n\n#8. Strangers\nCats do not like strangers or surprise visits. They like to feel they are in control of the territory around them. Strangers bring a lot of new smells and signs that they have yet to explore. \nCats usually hide when an unknown person or animal visits them. However, if they have been socialized since they were little, they usually don\u2019t mind strangers as much. \n\nAnimal experts suggest that your cats need to approach your friends. Not the other way around. \n\n\n#9. Lack of routine \nRoutines are very important because cats are very sensitive to change. Cats like to be in control of their environment and a small change can unbalance them entirely. So, if you need to make changes to your house, or move to another place, make sure you prepare your pet in advance. \n\n#10. Riding in a Car\nCats do not like getting in a car because it breaks up their daily routine of being at home. Unlike dogs, who love a good car ride, cats are the opposite. They get very stressed out when confronted with situations that are uncomfortable. \nSo if you have to take your cat to the vet, get them a comfortable towel they have snuggled in and then put them in a carrier. Preferably one they have slept in overnight. This will make them feel like they are still in their own space. \n\n\n#11. balloons\nIt\u2019s true. Cats see balloons as a threat they can\u2019t defeat. \nTo them, a balloon of any kind looks like an intruder that may hurt you or them. Keep in mind, if a cat finds a mouse or a large insect, they have a chance of defeating it. With a balloon, they just get scared because they can\u2019t overcome it.  \n\n\n#12. Posing for photos\nIf you are a cat lover, you may have seen some cute photos with a cat in a selfie. \nBut let\u2019s think about real life for a moment. Your cat does not want to be posed. They also don\u2019t want to be put in a costume for a photo.", "date": "Mar 17, 2020", "views": "6,101,922 views", "comments": "8,284", "likes": "115,508 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 339.521, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INhgQKMB1cU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rx42WoEe1M": {"title": "8 Sounds Cats Make and What They Mean", "content creator": "Jaw-Dropping Facts", "description": "In this video, we\u2019ll talk about the top 8 common sounds cats make and explain the meaning behind them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen cats make sounds, they\u2019re trying to communicate an emotion or desire. Some cat noises indicate contentment and happiness, while others reflect fear, worry, or even anger. \nHissing\nContrary to popular belief, hissing is a normal way that cats express fear, not aggression or hostility. It is a cat\u2019s clear way of saying, \u201cBack off or I\u2019ll be forced to attack.\u201d\nCats characteristically want to avoid confrontation at all costs, so think of hissing as a warning. You may see cats make this sound when they feel threatened, if a mother cat has kittens to protect, or if the vet is trying to examine your feline.\nThe hissing sound is usually paired with other feline body language signs like bared teeth, flattened ears, and an arched back. \nAnd remember, cats may also hiss at you when they\u2019re in pain, and you touch them on a particularly sensitive part of their body. \nChattering\nCat chattering almost always happens when a cat is fascinated by a visual stimulus such as a bird or rodent outside a window.\nIf you watch your cat\u2019s body language when they chatter, you\u2019ll often notice that their eyes widen with excitement, their ears tilt forward, and they are fixated on their target. This is because chattering is often a reaction to prey.\nTheories suggest that cats chatter in a response to the excitement of seeing their hunt, and the frustration of not being able to catch it. A prey being near but untouchable is so provocative that it causes a feline to express themselves physically.\nMeowing  \nMeowing is an interesting vocalization because adult cats don't meow at each other. \nKittens meow to draw the attention of their mothers\u2013 like when they are cold or hungry. But once the kittens are grown, the meowing stops. This means that meowing is often not part of adult cat-to-cat communication\u2014it is used almost exclusively with humans. \nIn general, cats meow at people when they want something\u2014like attention, food, warmth, or perhaps access to a closed room.\nKeep in mind that meowing comes in several variations, and we can interpret what our pet is trying to say by paying attention to the intensity and tone of the meow as well as observing their body language. In general, the more intense a cat\u2019s meow, the more important or urgent the message. \nPurring\nCats purr when they are happy and content. \nCats also purr as a way to soothe or comfort themselves when they\u2019re sick or anxious. Studies have shown that the low frequency of a cat purring causes a series of vibrations inside their body that can relieve pains, heal injuries, and repair tendons. Research has shown that the vibrations caused by purring can promote bone growth. In fact, purr-like vibration devices have been proposed for potential use in space flights to retain astronauts\u2019 bone density. Purring also acts as a relaxing internal massage for felines.\nChirping or Trilling \nTrilling is a chirpy, high-pitched sound that is mostly used by female cats. This is because when kittens are young, the mother cat will trill at them as a cue to encourage her kittens to follow her, or as a strategy to capture her kittens\u2019 attention. \nIf your cat is trilling at you, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re requesting the same\u2014they want to get your attention! Cats also trill to greet their humans. It\u2019s a cat\u2019s way of saying, \u201cHello, I\u2019m here!\u201d.\nAll in all, the trilling sound is almost always a sign of a positive emotion or a welcoming vibe. \nCaterwauling\nCaterwauling is a cat vocalization that sounds like a cross between a yowl, a howl, and a whine.\nMore often than not, an unspayed female cat in heat will produce this disturbing sound to attract prospective mates. \nGrowling\nThe growl is another sound that cats make when they are angry or want to scare off a potential threat.  It is a very clear warning to step back and may be the last step before attacking. \nBut remember, if your cat growls frequently, it may be a sign of pain or health issue.\nYowling\nYowling sounds like a long, drawn-out moan that comes from a cat\u2019s throat. Unlike meowing, yowling is not only a cat-to-human communication. Adult cats also yowl at one another, usually during their breeding season.\nA yowl may indicate that the cat is not feeling well or is in distress or pain. Yowling may also occur when the cat has some sort of territorial concern \u2013 like when something in her environment (such as a new cat in her area) isn\u2019t to her liking. \nAll in all, yowling is a cat\u2019s way of saying \u201cStay out of my territory\u201d, or \u201cI want to mate\u201d. \nCats often scream after a mating session or when they are in the middle of a cat fight.  \nScreaming may also indicate that your cat is very sick or in serious pain. \nBreed Talk\nAs a rule of thumb, longhaired cats tend to be less talkative and outgoing than shorthaired felines. If you prefer a less vocal cat, consider a Russian Blue, Persian, Chartreux, Maine Coon, or Norwegian Forest Cat.", "date": "Jun 17, 2021", "views": "980,839 views", "comments": "641", "likes": "15,400 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 500.961, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rx42WoEe1M"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj-SVzEAic8": {"title": "12 Ways to Tell Your Cat You Love Them in a Language They Understand", "content creator": "Jaw-Dropping Facts", "description": "In this video, we\u2019ll show you 12 ways to tell your cat you love them in language they\u2019re sure to understand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#12.  Slow Eye Blink \nSlowly blinking your eyes at your cat is akin to the human kiss. Cats show affection by looking at someone and slowly closing their eyes and opening them again.  Get to eye level with your cat and do the same thing.  Meet their gaze and blink back.  They will know you love them too.  Animal experts use this technique to calm fearful cats.\n#11.  Scent Mingling\nWhen your cat rubs against you, it is a true sign that you are their person.  Cats have scent glands in their cheeks and head.  When they rub against you, they are claiming you as their own by leaving their scent on you.  If your kitty shows this kind of affection, you are truly family.  Show them the same affection by leaning into them and don\u2019t move away as they are wandering in and around your legs.  \nIf you would like to initiate the affection, reach your finger out toward their nose and let them rub their cheeks along your hand.  They will know that this is a sign of acceptance and love.\n\n#10.  Massage Your Cat\nThe same way humans love a good massage so does a cat.  Petting your cat from head to tail not only feels good, but it can also lower blood pressure in your pet.  Pay attention so that you can learn what your cat likes best.  Do they like more pressure at the base of their tail?  Maybe they prefer to be rubbed under the cheeks.  An added benefit of the all-over massage is that you can detect some of the health problems your cat may have.  You will be able to find matted fur or any lump, bumps, or sores that may need attention.\n\n#9. Let Them Lick You \nCats lick themselves to keep themselves clean. Often times they lick you to reassure you that they love you back. Consider a cat\u2019s lick as the equivalent to human\u2019s hug. Let them lick you and don\u2019t move away. You will disappoint them immensely. \n\n#8. Vocal Cues\nCats have special meows, coos, or trills that they use with humans they are close to.  If you imitate their sounds, they will understand it as a display of affection.  This also helps them to feel safe, secure and loved. You might think you sound like the crazy cat lady talking to her pet alone, but your cat won\u2019t think so. \n\n#7.  Interactive Play\nCats are predators but they don\u2019t get to use their instincts when they are at your home. \nProviding your cat with interactive play toys allows them to exercise their predatory nature.  Interactive games are also good for shy cats who need to build confidence, and overactive cats who need stimulation and exercise.  Some cats like puzzle toys that you hide treats in because it lets them use their brain, their teeth, and their nose.  Cats are also delighted with cat gyms that have climbing, clawing, and hiding opportunities.\n\n#6.  Several Beds\nCats love sleeping.  Providing places to sleep lets your cat know that you care about their comfort and happiness.  Having a few beds in different places will let your cat know that your space is her space.  They can choose to be around people or choose a bed in a quiet place if they want to be left alone. Many cats like to be up high, so consider a tall cat tree a roomy bed on top.\n\n#5. Hiding Spot\nCats feel safe when they can hide in an enclosed space.  From there, your cat can observe and decide if they are comfortable enough to come out or not.  Have cardboard boxes and cat caves available so that your cat can have alone time when needed.  This will show them that you understand their needs and that you love them.\n\n#4. Personal Space \nCats are territorial creatures. They don\u2019t like to be smothered with affection. Make sure you provide them all the personal space they want. After all, if you like a constant companion that followed you everywhere in your home, you would\u2019ve adopted a dog. \n\n#3. Grooming\nCats are extremely clean animals and they devote a large portion of their day for self-grooming. \nThey love to groom themselves but they also like to be pampered by a human they trust and love.  You can brush your cat gently or just pet them.  A de-shedding brush or comb helps to keep your cat looking and feeling great.  It can also help to keep the fur mat-free and reduce hairballs by removing excess fur.  Grooming your cat is similar to the massage in that it is relaxing and gives you bonding time.\n\n#2.  Healthy Food and Treats\nPay attention to your cat\u2019s preferences.  They may prefer one flavor over another and will love you more when you feed them what they want.  \nTreats help your cat to exercise both their brain and their body which is important for a long and healthy life.\n\n#1.  Scratching post\nCats scratch to stay both physically and mentally healthy.  Scratching is a way to mark their territory, to exercise, and to experience pleasure.  Cats need something, other than your furniture, to scratch.  Some materials like sisal fabric is key to a cat\u2019s happiness as it feels like tree bark to a cat.", "date": "May 3, 2020", "views": "3,510,615 views", "comments": "4,830", "likes": "81,923 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 338.121, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj-SVzEAic8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=777F2k72yoo&list=RDCMUCfHTrA_ceeXZePMJRtuCuNQ&start_radio=1&rv=777F2k72yoo": {"title": "10 Scientific Ways to Get a Cat to Like You", "content creator": "Jaw-Dropping Facts", "description": "In this video, we\u2019ll show you 10 proven ways to get a cat to love you.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet them make the first move\nCats are so adorable that people want to greet them with a big hug. Some people go up to the cat, corner them, and try to pet them to win them over. But remember, this is a common mistake for cat lovers. According to the recent studies, it\u2019s best to let the cat make the first move. A study conducted in Switzerland has shown that when humans sit back and wait\u2014and focus on something else, like reading a book\u2014cats are more likely to approach.\nThis is why many kitties are attracted to allergic people\u2014as people with allergies don\u2019t really seek out to pet cats. \nPet them where they enjoy it most\nHow does your cat enjoy being pet? \nA study conducted by the University of Lincoln i found that cats show more positive behavioral responses\u2014like purring or kneading\u2014when they are pet between the eyes and ears. And they display more negative responses\u2014like hissing, swatting or swishing their tails\u2014when they are pet around their tail area. \nYes, that\u2019s right. Cats don\u2019t actually enjoy being stroked at the base of their tail. Researchers believe that a cat\u2019s tail area is an erogenous zone.\nCheck your scent\nA cat's sense of smell is the main way they identify people and objects. Their sense of smell is 14 times better than that of humans. If a cat is afraid of you, make sure to check your scent as your cat might be staying clear of it. \nYou may have the scent of another cat or dog on your pants, or you may have strong smells like perfume, deodorizers, disinfectants, bleach, garlic or onions on your clothing. If your cat retreats when they sniff your hands, it may be because they don\u2019t like the smell of your hand soap. \nApproach them like a cat \nCats communicate primarily through scent and body language. Most felines greet each other with a nose-to-nose stiff. \nAnd while humans shake hands, cats boop to say hello.  \nTo increase your bond with a cat, try approaching them the way they would greet other felines. Mimic the nose-to-nose behavior by gently offering your non-threatening fingertip at their nose level. Your finger acts like a nose substitute and most cats will walk up and sniff or investigate your finger, \nMimic felines\u2019 scents\nCats, on the other hand, don\u2019t like new smells, and any unfamiliar scent can put them off. \nAnd this is why most cats are not big fans of change, relocation, or strangers. As new environments bring a lot of new smells and signs that they have yet to explore. \n If you don\u2019t want to bring new smells to a cat\u2019s home, you may spray yourself with a cat pheromone.\nPheromones are a type of chemical communication that all cats use to interact with each other and the environment around them. These \u201cmessages\u201d are released from the scent glands around their body. you may want to spray yourself  to calm a new cat. \nHuman interaction over food\nA 2017 research conducted in the Oregon State University studied what attracts cats the most. \nThe scientists offered cats a choice between food, toys, scent, and social interaction with humans and watched what happens. Believe it or not, they found that most cats prefer social interaction with humans over everything else \u2014 even food. Interestingly enough, some recent studies suggest that what really attracts cats to humans is the presence of interactive toys.\nDon\u2019t block the exits.\nIf you appear as an imposing, enormous creature in their space, they may perceive you as a threat. Instead, get down and approach them at their level. And make sure not to block the exits. \nBlink slowly, but never stare\nCats stare when they are hunting. Their ability to stare without regular blinking helps them keep a close eye on their prey. If you stare at them, you are giving them the same look they give when they hunt. \nInstead, give them plenty of long, slow blinks. This shows the cat that you are relaxed and friendly, and you don\u2019t want to hunt them. \nRetreat at the right time \nThere are many signs that a cat doesn\u2019t like your actions or feels uncomfortable around you. \nSome signs are overt\u2014like hissing and biting\u2014but some are more subtle--like when they flatten their ears, or twitch their tails. If you get one of these signals, it\u2019s time to back off.\nUse Treats Strategically\nYou can encourage your cat to be near you with a yummy, stinky treat. This doesn\u2019t mean showering them with treats all day long. Instead, use treats strategically to either reward good social interactions with you, or to entice a shy cat to walk towards you. \nYou can also try talking quietly to the cat as they eat the treats so they associate your voice with rewards.\nAnd while a dog may wolf down any kind of dog food you bring them, a cat will not. Cats are not very food-motivated so you might have to search for a treat that they like.", "date": "Feb 10, 2021", "views": "6,589,785 views", "comments": "7,300", "likes": "138,077 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 482.761, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=777F2k72yoo&list=RDCMUCfHTrA_ceeXZePMJRtuCuNQ&start_radio=1&rv=777F2k72yoo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0QhgQ-g4C0": {"title": "The Supernatural Finale Aired, And Tumblr Exploded", "content creator": "Sarah Z", "description": "Supernatural ended.

Scratching! \nWe have all seen how our furniture looks like after a cat gets to it with their claws. Scratching is one of the instinctual behaviors that your cat does for fun, to sharpen their claws, and to mark their territory within the home. If this behavior is becoming a problem, we recommend that you place some scratching posts around for them, especially near their favorite scratch spots. Playing with them during the day to release their energy might also help reduce this behavior. \n\n#2. Sunbathing! \nDoes your cat have a favorite spot on the windowsill? Basking in the sun during the day is a favorite pastime of kitty cats. This is because cats like temperatures of 20 degrees higher than human\u2019s ideal temperature. They seek out heat and when they find it, they like to nap in that spot. This could be by any heat source, such as a portable heater, a computer, or on top of a heating vent. \n#3. Observing!  \nCats can spend countless hours staring out a window and watching the world go by. They are fascinated with objects that get blown around by the wind, insects, people, and birds. If you have an indoor cat and they are alone, definitely open up your blinds and give them a spot on the windowsill so that they can be entertained.  \n\n#4. High Spots! \nCats love to sleep in high places as this protects them from getting ambushed unexpectedly. They also love to view the world and everything that goes on around them from these high spots.  Consider purchasing a cat patio with multiple levels so that they can climb, or try purchasing multi-level cat towers, climbing nets, and high shelving to let them explore this desire. \n\n#5. Having Their Butt Scratched\nHas your cat ever walked up to you, turned around, and presented their tail end? Good! This area right above the tail is where a cat cannot use its paws or tongue to scratch.\nSome cats love to back up against a dangling hand if they want a good scratch.\n\n#6. Sleeping! \nCats sleep 15-16 hours on average in a day! When they are sleeping, avoid bothering them, as this will ensure that you don\u2019t stress them out or harm their wellbeing. If your cat is just a kitten, definitely make sure that they get undisturbed sleep.\n\n\n#7. Running water\nCats love drinking water from running faucets. \nThis is because your cat might instinctively be suspicious of stagnant water, realizing that still water isn't always safe as bacteria and microbes grow exponentially in them.\nThe running water from the tap also probably tastes better because it's cooler and oxygenated.\nFortunately, there are lots of drinking fountains\u2014designed for cats\u2014to provide fresh, cool, and running water for your pet. \n\n\n#8. Hunting! \nYou won\u2019t find any cat that doesn\u2019t get the urge to hunt. For most cats, this is going to be in the middle of your night, and while this is unfortunate, don\u2019t discourage it. Do not yell at them, or look on in revulsion when they bring you their prized catch, as this innate need helps them survive. Stalking prey is thrilling to them and it would be a shame to try and prevent it. \n\n\n\n\n\n#9. Being Petted! \nCats love affection despite being pretty independent.  Generally, they will ask to be petted, so do not force it. Cats can be sensitive to touch, so if they growl, hiss, bat at you, or do a tail flick, stop immediately. \n\n#10. Play Time! \nCats will play with toys, with you, or with objects that intrigue them like bottle tabs, crinkly bags, and straws or string. Don\u2019t just rely on toys to ensure their happiness though, it is better to spend time with them if you can. \n\n#11. Food!  \nCats adore food. They will eat fresh food that is newly opened. But they won\u2019t touch it after that. Cats need to eat daily, but not in the same way as dogs do. If your cat is picking at their food, they are telling you they don\u2019t like it because it may be stale. \nTo keep your cat healthy, regularly change up their diet and incorporate small, healthy treats every once in a while. This ensures that they feel loved and cared for. \n\n\n#12. Spending Time with Family.  \nWhile cats are considered independent and are often left alone, they do enjoy spending time with their family. Cats will greet you at the door when you arrive, cuddle with you before bedtime, and lick you to show their affection. \n\nNow that you know what your cat loves the most, make sure to make time to incorporate them into their daily lives. They will thank you for it and be healthier for it.", "date": "Mar 15, 2020", "views": "1,595,184 views", "comments": "1,670", "likes": "28,422 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 252.741, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9AMxpAim3k"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzuhuaeS0aQ": {"title": "Cat Body Language 101", "content creator": "Jackson Galaxy", "description": "It\u2019s always a good time to either learn or brush on cat basics.

Here is the list of unusual cat behaviors. \n\nChewing on plastic\nIf your cat is chewing on plastic, blankets, furniture or other things they shouldn\u2019t be chewing on, they may have pica.  Cats often get pica from anxiety or disorders in their gut. \n\n\nItation of the ears \nEars movement is an indication that your cat is feeling uncomfortable or anxious about something in their environment. If their ears aren\u2019t moving independently and are only slightly pulled back they are alert and listening to what is going on around them.\n\n Not covering Their Litter\nIn the wild, cats dig a hole when the need to poop. When they are done, they cover it up to hide their scent from predators.  If your cat isn\u2019t covering their poop it is best to take them to the vet to eliminate the possibility of a paw injury or urinary tract infection. \n\nknock off everything!\n Cats feel their surrounding with their paws which are incredibly sensitive. By knocking things over they satisfy their curiosity, seeing exactly what will happen when they touch something.  \n\nNumber 10 \u2013 Tiger Eyes - narrow pupils. cat's pupil. \nThis usually stems from their predatory response and they are probably focused on their next bit of prey. This could be because they want to play and have fun with you, or that they have set their sights on a bug to hunt. \n\n\nNumber 9 - Rubbing\nAs a cat owner, one of the things you would notice the most is how they rub up against you with their head.  This behavior is called bunting. \n\nNumber 8 - Biting their nails\nOne of those reasons is keeping their nails clean and short. It could be thought that your furry friend is anxious or has a bad habit. Like people, cats can bite their nails when they are bored or if they feel anxious. And just like people, this can become a bad habit that is difficult to break. You will need to try and find out if your cat is just nervous or if they are bored and need some form of play or entertainment. \n\nNumber 7 - Crazy Runs \nYour cat may start sprinting around your house or apartment, bouncing off of the walls and furniture without any warning.  Naturally, cats can run up to thirty miles per hour and when they are kept indoors all day they energy becomes pent up. \n\nNumber 6 \u2013 Sleeping on your laptop \ncats like the warmth of your laptop. Cats like temperatures of 20 degrees higher than human\u2019s ideal temperature. \nNumber 5 - Eating your houseplants \nCats bite and chew plants for a variety of reasons. In the wild, indigestion is often cured by eating grass, so if they are feeling a little gassy they may start munching on your plants. \n\n\nNumber 4 \u2013 Crazy Legs\nCats sleeping exposing belly. sometimes laying down or sitting with your legs and arms sprawled is incredibly comfortable and relaxing. \n\n\n\nNumber 3 \u2013 2:00am Cat Calls\nSome cats enjoy a little night time singing. This can become extremely annoying, especially when you do not get to laze around all day and sleep like your cat does. There can be quite a few reasons why your cat is howling at night. \n\n\n\n\n\nNumber 2 - Straight from the tap \nGenerally, cats are not a great fan of water but a running tap seems to be their favorite drinking spot. Running water is clean and free of disease where still water usually contains all kinds of bacteria that may be harmful to your cat.", "date": "Jan 8, 2020", "views": "3,727,911 views", "comments": "4,212", "likes": "72,787 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 655.861, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6DjFX3rgJo&list=RDCMUCfHTrA_ceeXZePMJRtuCuNQ&start_radio=1&rv=I6DjFX3rgJo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0QhgQ-g4C0&list=RDCMUCK-GxvzttTnNhq3JPYpXhqg&start_radio=1&rv=M0QhgQ-g4C0": {"title": "The Supernatural Finale Aired, And Tumblr Exploded", "content creator": "Sarah Z", "description": "Supernatural ended.

His accomplishments have led to record-breaking viewership of his standup specials on NBC, Netflix and Comedy Central. After being named a top ten grossing comedian by Forbes in 2019, the Dallas native begins his new arena and theater tour in 2021 with Jeff Dunham: Seriously!? which was delayed due to Covid-19.\n\nIn addition to Forbes, Dunham was recently nominated by Pollstar for \u201cComedy Tour of The Year,\u201d based on box office sales as well also being awarded \u201cBillboard\u2019s Top Comedy Tour,\u201d for three years. Last fall the comedian released his second Netflix stand-up special, Jeff Dunham: Beside Himself, filmed at the American Airlines Center in his hometown of Dallas, TX. Beside Himself marked Jeff\u2019s ninth special, an unprecedented number in the comedy community, having previously aired specials with Comedy Central and NBC. Dunham also holds the record for the first, second and fourth most watched specials ever on Comedy Central. His latest Comedy Central special, Jeff Dunham\u2019s Completely Unrehearsed Last-Minute Pandemic Holiday Special  is set to premiere Thanksgiving weekend on Friday, November 27th at 8pm PT/ET. This will be the first of three specials set to debut on the network, treating fans to more of his delightfully twisted cohorts, Peanut, Walter, Jos\u00e9 Jalape\u00f1o, Bubba J and Achmed the Dead Terrorist.\n\nNot only a mainstay in arenas, Dunham is leading the charge with online content as well and has blossomed to over 10.1 million followers on Facebook and over 2.8 million YouTube subscribers, amassing well over a billion views. His astonishing arena-packing power has put him on par with major music acts such as Bruno Mars and Metallica. In 2017, Dunham received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, commemorating over 20 years of comedy dominance.\n\nDunham has also made many cameo appearances across television and film, from the Emmy Award-winning comedy series 30 Rock, Angie Tribeca, and Dinner for Schmucks, starring Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd.\n\nHis autobiography, All By My Selves: Walter, Peanut, Achmed and Me, was on the 'New York Times\u2019 Best Seller list three weeks in a row.\n\nFor more info regarding the tour, stand-up specials, book, and more please visit: ", "date": "Nov 15, 2021", "views": "11,334 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "162 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 30.061, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZu_RTXZP6U"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFetFqrVBNc": {"title": "Health Care Sharing Ministries: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)", "content creator": "LastWeekTonight", "description": "Health Care Sharing Ministries, or HCSMs, advertise themselves as a more affordable, faith-based alternative to health insurance.

He traveled across the country meeting Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, Chambers of Commerce and any other civic-minded local groups. This continued and intensified during his service as the General Electric spokesperson while hosting their sponsored television series. \"The Speech\" was delivered in various forms and to different audiences as each word was honed, measured and memorized.\nDuring the 1964 Presidential campaign, Republican party officials in California, who knew Reagan's powerful message and delivery, asked him to film a speech on behalf of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater. The speech was aired on October 27, 1964 and it was electrifying. Donations to the Republican party and candidates increased dramatically.\n\nThe Republican Party took note and they targeted Reagan as a candidate from that point forward. He agreed in 1966 to run for Governor of California. He won two terms, and eventually won the Presidency.\n\nTable of Contents:", "date": "Apr 2, 2009", "views": "4,366,587 views", "comments": "1,404", "likes": "85,951 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1772.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXBswFfh6AY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YomUYWnfAOc": {"title": "Tucker: Media treats Kamala like a demi-God", "content creator": "Fox News", "description": "'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host recaps the Vice President's latest blunders. #FoxNews #Tucker\n\nSubscribe to Fox News! https://bit.ly/2vaBUvAS", "date": "Jun 8, 2021", "views": "4,619,501 views", "comments": "13,128", "likes": "74,418 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 835.521, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YomUYWnfAOc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV8XfK9ACQg": {"title": "Steve Forbes reacts to Biden's 'fairy tale' remarks on jobs", "content creator": "Fox News", "description": "Chairman and Editor-in-Chief Steve Forbes on the jobs report falling far short of expectation. #FoxNews", "date": "Jan 7, 2022", "views": "596,946 views", "comments": "2,989", "likes": "16,147 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 324.781, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV8XfK9ACQg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksKvZoUCPQ": {"title": "Bill Burr - no reason to hit a woman - how women argue (FULL) from You People are all the Same", "content creator": "mcnyregrus", "description": "The FULL segment about how women argue and why there's no reason to hit a woman from Bill Burr's show \"You people are all the same\"", "date": "Jan 29, 2016", "views": "18,258,293 views", "comments": "13,039", "likes": "282,975 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 734.241, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksKvZoUCPQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EHJoUny8BY": {"title": "The First Phineas Drawing", "content creator": "Dan Povenmire", "description": "", "date": "Jan 16, 2022", "views": "275,295 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "33,505 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 39.721, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EHJoUny8BY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMWlRWnAZH8&list=RDCMUCMiJRAwDNSNzuYeN2uWa0pA&start_radio=1&rv=QMWlRWnAZH8": {"title": "21 HORRIFIC Tech Fails they want you to forget.", "content creator": "Mrwhosetheboss", "description": "From Cyberpunk to the Cybertruck, from Smartphones to the Not-so-Smart Home, here are my top 21 Tech fails of the 2021 and the past Decade!

Within a decade, the share of urban dwellers is expected to increase to 75 percent. Construction is booming and competition for residential land is fierce.\n\nBut the right to live in a city in China is conditional. Authorities want their modern cities to be peopled with well-educated, highly-qualified or politically well-connected residents. As a result, certain standards have to be met to be eligible for a modern, urban home. Only members of China's political classes and the financially successful have a hope of qualifying. Yet more than half of the people who live in cities are so-called \"migrant workers.\" They come from rural communities and have no official rights to settle in cities. They are there to work. With no proper rights, they are merely tolerated while they serve as merchants, servants, waitstaff, cleaners, construction workers and tradespeople. But while they are indispensable to daily life in the cities, they are unable to afford their exorbitant rents. This documentary looks at how and where these workers live, and asks whether middle and working class Chinese even figure in the official vision of shiny, high-tech cities.

The figure is much higher than last week's daily jab rate of 593,000 doses. Many of the vaccinations were booster shots, which have been administered to more than 45% of the population. The number of people in Germany who are fully vaccinated (and not yet boostered) rose to more than 72% on Thursday. Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government set a goal to have 80% of the population fully vaccinated by the end of January.\n\nFrance:\nFrance is easing some of its strict travel restrictions on visitors from the UK, French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced. Fully vaccinated British travelers who also have a COVID negative test will be allowed to enter France without having to self-isolate for 48-hours\u2014 and will no longer have to provide a \"valid\" reason for travel. The rules change goes into effect on Friday. Castex said France was relaxing the travel curbs since the highly-contagious omicron variant is now dominant in both France and the UK. The curbs had been in place since mid-December. Also in France, teachers across the country went on strike on Thursday over the government's chaotic COVID-19 strategy for schools. \"The exhaustion and exasperation of the entire educational community have reached an unprecedented level,\" eleven unions said in a joint statement. France has logged an ever-climbing surge in infections this week, including a record of over 368,000 new cases in a single day.\n\nIndia:\nIndia recorded its highest-ever new daily COVID caseload on Thursday \u2014 logging more than 247,000 new daily cases for the first time. India is in the midst of a third wave of infections,  with the omicron variant causing cases to exponentially rise in cities like New Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nSubscribe: ", "date": "Jan 14, 2022", "views": "127,168 views", "comments": "491", "likes": "1,400 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 841.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp0IEZ9N9mo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ewYYiHiDtQ&list=RDCMUCyEd6QBSgat5kkC6svyjudA&index=1": {"title": "$284 Fisherman\u2019s Platter!!

The round-shaped structure relied on a wooden roof and beams for support.\n\nThree years later, WASP printed an all-earth two-domed home dubbed TECLA (Technology + Clay) using two synchronized printing arms, which were programmed to pick, mix and pump materials into layers. At their headquarters in Massa Lombarda, Italy, it took 200 hours, 7000 machine codes, and 6kw of energy to print the 350 layers of clay.\n\nWASP (World's Advanced Saving Project) is the brainchild of father-daughter team Massimo and Francesca Moretti. Launched in 2011 when Francesca, a designer, began tinkering with early 3D printers and introduced her electronic technician father to the tech. \n\nMassimo, inspired by nature - and specifically the mason wasp which builds its own nest with material recovered from the surrounding environment - began designing a 3D printer capable of building houses with local, natural materials \u201cat a cost tending to zero\u201d.\n\nIn late 2021, WASP worked with fashion house Dior to print a pop-up store in Dubai covered in their signature Cannage motif (3D printed using clay, sand, and raw fibers). The same year, they used the Crane 3D printer to create the \u201clivable sculpture\u201d titled \u201cHouse of Dust\u201d; it took 50 hours of 3D printing, 500 G-codes, 165 15mm-layers, 15 kilometers of extrusion, and eight cubic meters of material to print the 16-square-meter habitable structure in Wiesbaden, Germany.", "date": "Dec 26, 2021", "views": "537,785 views", "comments": "1,291", "likes": "18,721 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1252.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MLJs1KRa0Y"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQpWV02jJ9k": {"title": "Tsunami waves crash ashore in Tonga after volcanic eruption", "content creator": "Al Jazeera English", "description": "A tsunami has hit the Pacific nation of Tonga after an undersea volcano erupted.\nThe extent of the damage is still unclear as many phone lines are down. \nWarnings remain in place for Samoa, Fiji, Vanuatu and parts of Australia.\nAl Jazeera's @Andrew Chappelle has more.\n\n- Subscribe to our channel: ", "date": "Jan 15, 2022", "views": "1,063,474 views", "comments": "925", "likes": "7,927 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 80.761, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQpWV02jJ9k"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrWce_f8Vw": {"title": "Seven sins of the marketplace (Marketplace)", "content creator": "CBC News", "description": "From exposing the situation in long-term care homes to fake online reviews to tracking your recycling and killing the buzz on popular products like UV disinfecting devices, CBC Marketplace is counting down the top seven \"sins\" some companies and governments commit against consumers.\n\nTo read more: ", "date": "Apr 9, 2021", "views": "202,413 views", "comments": "281", "likes": "3,159 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1350.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrWce_f8Vw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsxZ3OIjwN0": {"title": "Replacing Coil in Carrier FX4DNF025 - No Heat, No Air", "content creator": "HVAC GUY", "description": "Customer called because of system constantly running, not heating, and not cooling.

Why did the Japanese attack the USA? - The answer is oil. \n\nJapan had been modernising its economy throughout the 20th century and wanted to build an empire of its own. However, Japan lacked the natural resources to make it a reality, with all but 6% of its oil supply being imported. After capturing Manchuria, Japan became bogged down in a full-scale war with China in 1937 and had to look elsewhere for the resources it needed to fight. Meanwhile, the USA was slowly awakening from its isolationism.\n\nWhen Japan occupied French Indochina in 1941, America retaliated by freezing all Japanese assets in the states, preventing Japan from purchasing oil. Having lost 94% of its oil supply and unwilling to submit to U.S demands, Japan planned to take the oil needed by force. However, striking south into British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies would almost certainly provoke an armed U.S response. To blunt that response, Japan decided to attack the U.S Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, hoping that the U.S would negotiate peace. \n\nThe attack at Pearl Harbor was a huge gamble, but one which did not pay off. Though Japan took its objectives in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, the U.S did not respond as expected. Instead of reverting to isolationism, the U.S geared up for total war and Japan's fate was sealed. \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: ", "date": "Nov 10, 2021", "views": "2,187,896 views", "comments": "3,890", "likes": "28,548 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 831.501, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so4v_2zq35k"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6Vzd4u84_4": {"title": "The Most MISUNDERSTOOD Songs in Music History", "content creator": "Alfo Media", "description": "outloudmerch.com/collections/alfo-media\nhttps://www.patreon.com/AlfoMedia\nhttps://twitter.com/renshawhs", "date": "Apr 16, 2021", "views": "2,662,569 views", "comments": "12,746", "likes": "105,143 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 666.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6Vzd4u84_4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrdnckE_sUM": {"title": "Jack Murphy and the Toxicity of \"Alpha Male\" Scammers", "content creator": "Blaire White", "description": "We need to talk about the Jack Murphy debacle and the world of Alpha Male charlatans.\n\u25cf MY NEW PODCAST!!: https://www.patreon.com/blairewhite\n\u25cf Twitter & Instagram: @msblairewhite @michaelmalice\n\u25cf NEW!

First we need to grind out as much of the bearing material that is in the eye before setting up and tack welding on the bearing mounts for positioning the line boring machine. We need to line bore out the eye material before bore welding to build up new material and then boring out to spec. The eye is then ready for facing, cutting the chamfers and snap ring grooves before drilling in the holes for the grease port. The job is completed by cleaning up the eye surfaces and press fitting the new bearing into the eye using our hydraulic press.\n\nIn this video we are using:\n- Sir Meccanica WS2 Portable line boring machine\n- WIA 500i Weldmatic welder\n- HMP-150T Hydraulic press \n\nJoin our channel:\nWe upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!

Thomas Sowell dismisses that  question with a newly revised edition of his book Discrimination and Disparities. He sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss the long history of disparities among humans around the world and throughout time. He argues that discrimination has significantly less of a role to play in inequality than contemporary politicians give it credit for, and that something as incontrovertible as birth order of children has a more significant and statistically higher impact on success than discrimination. He discusses why parental attention is the most important aspect of a child\u2019s intellectual development. \n\nSowell goes on to break down different minority groups around the world who went on to have more economic and political success than their majority counterparts, such as the Indians in East Africa, Jewish people in Eastern Europe, Cubans in the United States, and the Chinese in Malaysia. He argues that there is an underlying assumption that if discrimination was absent equality would prevail, which historically has been proven wrong. \n\nSowell goes on to discuss changes in crime rates and poverty since the expansion of US welfare programs in the 1960s and how this has had a huge impact on the success of African Americans. He talks about his own experience growing up in New York, how housing projects used to be considered a positive place to live, and his experience as the first member of his family to enter the seventh grade. Robinson asks Sowell his thoughts on the case for reparations currently being made in Congress, and Sowell presents an argument about why a plan for reparations is not only illogical but also impossible to implement, with so many US citizens\u2019 ancestors arriving long after the Civil War. He also explains that slavery was common throughout the known world for thousands of years and that abolition movements didn\u2019t begin anywhere in the world until the late 18th century. He reminds us that the United States was not the only country guilty of participating in slavery and yet is the only country debating reparations. \n\nFor further information: ", "date": "May 17, 2019", "views": "709,174 views", "comments": "419", "likes": "16,766 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2792.141, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdHEbOAQFmY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdgPAetNY5U": {"title": "I Survived The Holocaust Twin Experiments", "content creator": "BuzzFeedVideo", "description": "Never forget \n\nTo donate to the CANDLES Holocaust Museum click here: ", "date": "Sep 15, 2017", "views": "21,284,930 views", "comments": "19,029", "likes": "739,411 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 887.741, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdgPAetNY5U"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw": {"title": "The Meaning and Reality of Individual Sovereignty", "content creator": "Jordan B Peterson", "description": "This special Independent Institute event was held on May 2, 2019, in San Francisco.

PO Thornton, as Assistant U.S. Navy Advisor, along with a U.S. Navy lieutenant serving as Senior Advisor, accompanied a 3-man Vietnamese Navy SEAL patrol on an intelligence gathering and prisoner capture operation against an enemy-occupied naval river base. Launched from a Vietnamese Navy junk in a rubber boat, the patrol reached land and was continuing on foot toward its objective when it suddenly came under heavy fire from a numerically superior force. The patrol called in naval gunfire support and then engaged the enemy in a fierce firefight, accounting for many enemy casualties before moving back to the waterline to prevent encirclement. Upon learning that the Senior Advisor had been hit by enemy fire and was believed to be dead, PO Thornton returned through a hail of fire to the lieutenant's last position; quickly disposed of 2 enemy soldiers about to overrun the position, and succeeded in removing the seriously wounded and unconscious Senior Naval Advisor to the water's edge. He then inflated the lieutenant's lifejacket and towed him seaward for approximately 2 hours until picked up by support craft. By his extraordinary courage and perseverance, PO Thornton was directly responsible for saving the life of his superior officer and enabling the safe extraction of all patrol members, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\nLearn more about the American Veterans Center: ", "date": "Mar 19, 2020", "views": "638,287 views", "comments": "1,320", "likes": "11,804 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2182.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY2zv8CqLhY&list=RDCMUCTnhya0OmSG64vw3fVgdGDg&start_radio=1&rv=tY2zv8CqLhY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpwSEVpk3I": {"title": "Dennis Prager | The Left is Destroying Western Civilization | Reclaiming Conservatism Conference", "content creator": "National Conservatism", "description": "Dennis Prager Keynote Address at the Reclaiming Conservatism Conference in Glen Cove, NY- December 19, 2016.\n\nDennis Prager is a best-selling author, nationally syndicated radio talk show host in the USA and co-founder of the internet phenomenon, PragerU.", "date": "Aug 6, 2021", "views": "308,093 views", "comments": "3,808", "likes": "12,429 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2711.861, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpwSEVpk3I"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgwdw4OgLDw": {"title": "Gutfeld: Elon Musk vs. Elizabeth Warren", "content creator": "Fox News", "description": "'Gutfeld!' panel reacts to Tesla founder calling the Massachusetts lawmaker \u2018Senator Karen\u2019 in spat over taxes\n#FoxNews #Gutfeld", "date": "Dec 16, 2021", "views": "714,623 views", "comments": "2,091", "likes": "24,110 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 427.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgwdw4OgLDw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ios-NT0fNI": {"title": "Sacred Music From Medieval Spain: The Llibre Vermell And The Cantigas De Santa Maria", "content creator": "AE SRamriel", "description": "mezzo tv\n\nLe Livre Vermeil de Montserrat par les Musiciens de Saint Julien et la Ma\u00eetrise de Radio France   \n\nMusique Sacr\u00e9e de l'Espagne M\u00e9di\u00e9vale\n\nMa\u00eetrise de Radio France, Sofi Jeannin (musical direction)\nLes Musiciens de Saint-Julien, Fran\u00e7ois Lazarevitch (musical direction)\n\nLlibre vermell de Montserrat\nVocal and instrumental \nO virgo splendens\nStella splendens\nLaudemus Virginem\nMariam, matrem virginem, attolite\nPolorum Regina\nCuncti simus concanentes\nSplendens ceptigera\nLos set gotxs\nImperayritz de la ciutat joyosa\nAd mortem festinamus\nSix Cantigas de Santa Maria\nCantiga 48 : Tanto son da Groriosa\nCantiga 52 : Mui gran Dereit e das bestias\nCantiga 57 : Mui grandes noit e dia\nCantiga 113 : Por razon tenuo d'obedecer\nCantiga 302 : A Madre de Jhesu-Cristo\nCantiga 311 : O que diz que servir ome\n\nRecorded at the Cath\u00e9drale d'Elne on 19 July 2013 during the Festival de Radio France et Languedoc-Roussillon\nDirected for TV by Olivier Simonnet", "date": "Mar 25, 2015", "views": "1,698,332 views", "comments": "2,650", "likes": "25,254 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4785.841, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ios-NT0fNI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg7VlLa-tD0": {"title": "A Lost War: Victor Davis Hanson and H.

McMaster and Hanson debate what worked and what failed, how social issues in the United States may have influenced our mission in Afghanistan and our decision to leave, and whether or not the United States should have continued to maintain a presence instead of leaving in a matter of weeks, abandoning thousands of Afghans loyal to the US mission there (as well as an unknown number of US citizens) after 20 years of military operations in the country.\n\nFor further information: ", "date": "Sep 20, 2021", "views": "311,814 views", "comments": "174", "likes": "7,484 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4558.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg7VlLa-tD0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w": {"title": "Why renewables can\u2019t save the planet | Michael Shellenberger | TEDxDanubia", "content creator": "TEDx Talks", "description": "Environmentalists have long promoted renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind farms to save the climate.

They settled on land that had only recently been covered by glaciers. This species, called Neanderthals, died out about 30,000 years ago -- but at one time, they formed the largest group in an area that stretched from northern France to the Belgian coast and from the Channel Islands to southern England. \n\nDuring the last Ice Age, the North Sea was frozen over -- and the English Channel was a small river that could easily be crossed on foot. The Neanderthals lived in close harmony with their perpetually changing environment. They had everything they needed to survive: the meat of prey animals, edible wild plants, water and wood for cooking and heating. How did these early humans develop over almost 300,000 years? What were their lives like before they became extinct? \n\nOur documentary is based on the latest research. We investigate various populations of Neanderthals, and visit archaeological sites in northern France, southern England, and on the island of Jersey. \n\nRenowned researchers such as the British paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer and his French colleague Ludovic Slimak describe how the Neanderthals lived, and discuss their cognitive abilities. Was this species capable of structured thinking? Did they have cultures, languages, and societies? How intelligent were they, and what sort of adaptive strategies kept them alive for 300,000 years? How similar were they to modern-day humans?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He bought an old \"rustico\" - stone farm building - for 20,000 euros and transformed it into his mountaintop hermitage. \n\nInspired by the early Christian desert hermits from the \"200s and 300s when some people went into the deserts of Egypt and Palestine searching for a more rigorous life\", Schwarz found something remote: he has only one full-time neighbor on the entire mountainside and in winter, he often has to snowshoe for a couple hours just to buy food and supplies. \n\nTo be as self-sufficient as possible, he makes his own bread and stores plenty of potatoes which he grows using Ruth Stout's \"No-Work\" gardening method. To grow much of his own fruit and produce, he terraced the steep hillside (using stones from the area) to create micro-climates. \"You try to build walls that have southern exposure because they heat up during the day and they give off the warmth and can make a difference of several degrees.\" (Studies show differences of 27\u00b0F/15\u00b0C in the ultra-deep Incan terraces). He grows plenty of tomatoes inside his self-built recycled greenhouse.\n\nFor heating and cooking, he built a combination rocket stove and masonry heater by creating his own casts and loam coating. His refrigerator, which he transported up the hill on top of his bicycle, is kept in the unheated room, along with his food stores. He uses a tiny 30-year-old 3-kilogram washing machine and built his bathroom out of salvaged materials. To transport the lumber up the hill for his remodel, he got some help from a local farmer.\n\nHe divided the old barn into four small rooms on two floors; the living room/kitchen and pantry on the ground floor and a chapel and bedroom upstairs. His bedroom also serves as an editing studio where he creates videos on philosophy and religion. \n\nHe created a wooden-arched indoor chapel where he \u201ccelebrates the traditional Latin mass\u201d alongside a wall he painted with Byzantine, romanesque and gothic styles in appreciation of \"the symbolism of the ancient art.\" \n\nJohannes\u2019 pilgrimage films: ", "date": "Dec 5, 2021", "views": "992,231 views", "comments": "2,141", "likes": "33,246 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1404.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF1jJy1F-8I"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z6YTyvCxRY": {"title": "Free To Choose - Milton Friedman on The Welfare System (1978) | Thomas Sowell", "content creator": "reelblack", "description": "Milton Freidman, in the fourth segment of the series, shows why he believes government-run welfare programs do not help the people they are intended to help or achieve the ends they are intended to achieve, and why the \"welfare state\" leads to loss of initiative, independence, and personal liberty. Friedman compares slum areas and luxury apartments of New York City, visits two families on welfare, one in Harlem and one in Britain, and argues in favor of the negative income tax. Featuring Thomas Sowell.\n\nShared for historical purposes. I do not own the rights.\n_____\n\nMilton Friedman (/\u02c8fri\u02d0dm\u0259n/; July 31, 1912 \u2013 November 16, 2006) was an American economist who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy.[4] With George Stigler and others, Friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the second generation of Chicago school of economics, a methodological movement at the University of Chicago's Department of Economics, Law School and Graduate School of Business from the 1940s onward. Several students and young professors who were recruited or mentored by Friedman at Chicago went on to become leading economists, including Gary Becker, Robert Fogel, Thomas Sowell[5] and Robert Lucas Jr.[6]\nFriedman's challenges to what he later called \"naive Keynesian\" theory[7] began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function. In the 1960s, he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies[8] and described his approach (along with mainstream economics) as using \"Keynesian language and apparatus\" yet rejecting its \"initial\" conclusions.[9] He theorized that there existed a \"natural\" rate of unemployment and argued that unemployment below this rate would cause inflation to accelerate.[10] He argued that the Phillips curve was in the long run vertical at the \"natural rate\" and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation.[11] Friedman promoted an alternative macroeconomic viewpoint known as \"monetarism\" and argued that a steady, small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy.[12] His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s. His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve's response to the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008.[13]\nFriedman was an advisor to Republican President Ronald Reagan[3] and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[2] His political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax and school vouchers[14] and opposed the war on drugs. His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice. - wikipedia\n\n#####\nReelblack's mission is to educate, elevate, entertain, enlighten, and empower through Black film.

First, Dave shares some of the most cringe-worthy moments from yesterday\u2019s Biden press conference. It was filled with stumbling, nonsensical statements, a call for more social media censorship, and ignored any questions from the press. Next, Dave discusses the Supreme Court\u2019s mixed rulings in a pair of cases challenging the Biden administration COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The Supreme Court blocked the OSHA vaccine mandate for large businesses, but upheld the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers. Finally, Dave shares a clip of Ronald Reagan where he describes how big government can entrench itself in our lives and the slippery slope that can lead to totalitarianism and authoritarianism. It\u2019s hard to articulate the slippery slope argument better than the great communicator himself, as he calls for a more limited government.\n\n----------\n\nWatch The Rubin Report on BlazeTV:", "date": "Jan 14, 2022", "views": "116,016 views", "comments": "2,039", "likes": "12,866 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1517.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MYa2YID1I0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qUwY5jEhNs": {"title": "Rep.

I mean, we all knew that right? Although Peter Parker is a quippy goofball who struggles in his personal life, he\u2019s still one of the strongest and smartest superheroes around. Though you\u2019re guaranteed a good time with plenty of jokes, you should be terrified if you had to face Spidey in a fight. His strength, his speed, his agility, and his spider-sense makes him a formidable opponent for just about anyone so no wonder he\u2019s beaten some of the best in the marvel universe!\n\nYes, that\u2019s right. There are plenty of instances where Peter had to trade blows with some Marvel heavy hitters and not surprisingly, Peter almost always comes out on top. Like of course, the instance that\u2019s all fresh in our minds is how Peter was able to beat the former Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange in the Mirror Dimension. In that situation, Peter used math to beat magic which is just about the nerdiest thing you can imagine. But there are plenty of other examples too. Did you know he once punched Hulk into space? Did you know that he once bluffed his way to a victory against Black Widow? Did you know he\u2019s taken on full teams like the X-Men and the Fantastic Four all at once and beaten them both no problem? Spidey is amazing!\n\nSo join me today as I discuss all the superheroes our friendly neighborhood web-head has defeated in the past.

Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?\n\nThis documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI\u2019s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI\u2019s social implications?\n\nA documentary by Tilman Wolff und Ranga Yogeshwar \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The series highlights the particular challenges facing the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, from national level maritime policy to naval concept development and program design. Given budgetary challenges, technological opportunities, and ongoing strategic adjustments, the nature and employment of U.S. maritime forces are likely to undergo significant change over the next ten to fifteen years. The Maritime Security Dialogue provides an unmatched forum for discussion of these issues with the nation\u2019s maritime leaders.\n\nVice Adm. Brad Cooper is a 1989 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, and earned a master\u2019s degree in Strategic Intelligence from the National Intelligence University. He has also studied national security policy and international relations at Harvard and Tufts Universities. His ship commands include USS Russell (DDG 59) and USS Gettysburg (CG 64). Cooper served in a variety of executive, military assistant and special assistant roles in the White House, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. Africa Command and U.S. Pacific Fleet Headquarters. He also served as principal U.S. Advisor to the Interior Minister of Afghanistan and director, Surface Warfare Officer Assignments (Pers-41). As a flag officer, he mostly recently served as commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic. Previous tours include service as Chief of Legislative Affairs, where he lead the Navy\u2019s engagement efforts with the U.S. Congress; commander, U.S. Naval Forces Korea during the height of tensions on the Korean Peninsula in 2016-2017; and commander, Expeditionary Strike Group 7 in Okinawa, Japan, where he lead U.S. 7th Fleet\u2019s Navy-Marine Corps team on the U.S. military\u2019s first F-35 deployment.\n\nThis event is made possible by support from Huntington Ingalls Industries.\n---------------------------------------------\nA nonpartisan institution, CSIS is the top national security think tank in the world. \nVisit www.csis.org to find more of our work as we bring bipartisan solutions to the world's greatest challenges.\n\nWant to see more videos and virtual events?

Kellen Lecture Series and Ullstein Buchverlage\n\nAt this ESMT Open Lecture, Harvard professor Niall Ferguson discussed and debated issues raised in his latest book Civilization: The West and the Rest.\n\nAbout the book\nIf in the year 1411 you had been able to circumnavigate the globe, you would have been most impressed by the dazzling civilizations of the Orient. The Forbidden City was under construction in Ming Beijing; in the Near East, the Ottomans were closing in on Constantinople.\n\nBy contrast, England would have struck you as a miserable backwater ravaged by plague, bad sanitation and incessant war. The other quarrelsome kingdoms of Western Europe - Aragon, Castile, France, Portugal and Scotland - would have seemed little better. As for fifteenth-century North America, it was an anarchic wilderness compared with the realms of the Aztecs and Incas. The idea that the West would come to dominate the Rest for most of the next half millennium would have struck you as wildly fanciful. And yet it happened.\n\nWhat was it about the civilization of Western Europe that allowed it to trump the outwardly superior empires of the Orient? The answer, Niall Ferguson argues, was that the West developed six \"killer applications\" that the Rest lacked: competition, science, democracy, medicine, consumerism and the work ethic. The key question today is whether or not the West has lost its monopoly on these six things. If so, Ferguson warns, we may be living through the end of Western ascendancy.\n\nCivilization takes readers on their own extraordinary journey around the world - from the Grand Canal at Nanjing to the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul; from Machu Picchu in the Andes to Shark Island, Namibia; from the proud towers of Prague to the secret churches of Wenzhou. It is the story of sailboats, missiles, land deeds, vaccines, blue jeans and Chinese Bibles. It is the defining narrative of modern world history.\n\nAbout the speaker\nNiall Ferguson is Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University and William Ziegler Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. He is also a Senior Research Fellow at Jesus College, Oxford University, and a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. Born in Glasgow in 1964, Niall Ferguson graduated from Magdalen College with First Class Honors in 1985. After two years as a Hanseatic Scholar in Hamburg and Berlin, he took up a research fellowship at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1989, subsequently returning to Oxford where he was appointed professor of Political and Financial History in 2000. Two years later he left for the US where he took up the Herzog Chair in Financial History at the Stern Business School, New York University, before moving to Harvard in 2004.\n\nNiall Ferguson is a regular contributor to press, television, and radio on both sides of the Atlantic and a prolific commentator on contemporary politics and economics.\n\nFind more information about our open lectures here: ", "date": "Aug 23, 2013", "views": "37,242 views", "comments": "34", "likes": "202 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6122.561, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLK3_9Seok0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7hEF8CS79U&list=RDCMUCKtFwcQCsl1ttW2CgOqFMUQ&start_radio=1&rv=v7hEF8CS79U": {"title": "Niall Ferguson on Why We Study History (full) | Conversations with Tyler", "content creator": "Mercatus Center", "description": "While the modern historical ethos can be obsessed with condescending to the past based on our current value system, Scottish-born historian Niall Ferguson has aimed to set himself apart with his willingness to examine the past in its own context.

Growing up in rural Vermont, he didn\u2019t know anyone else interested in birding his own age.

Mike decides to leave the game and asks Scarlett to marry him which she does. During their marriage, Mike could only whine about the life he lost because he married her. So she throws him out. And when he loses his job, he returns to the only place he's happy at - his old high school. And while looking at his high school photo, a janitor asks him if he wishes he could be 17 again and he says yes. One night while driving he sees the janitor on a bridge and apparently jumps in and he goes after him. When he returns to his friend, Ned's house, where he has been staying, he sees that he is 17 again.

The ox looking animal known as the Yak is key to their adaption. \n\nYak bulls and cows gives these mountain dwelling people milk, fur, meat, insulation, cement and also fuel! Yes, you heard right. Yak dung is used as fire-wood; fueling stoves and warm meals in communities living way above the tree-line.\n\nKyanjin Gumpa, which sits at 4000m above sea level, actually do have a little forest growing on a mountain nearby. Exactly how, given that the mountainside the town is built on is completely treeless, I never got a proper answer to. I did notice some small streams coming down the mountain the forest grows on though, meaning it's probably perpetually naturally irrigated. \n\nThe people living in Kyaanjin Gumpa hence don't have to solely rely on Yak dung for all their heat and cooking needs. But they do use it to supplement their fires, which regardless of which fuel is being burnt, are incredibly labor intensive to maintain.\n\nJust how labor intensive exactly?

So one day, I decided to challenge myself to learn the full middle splits as quickly as I could (while still being safe!!!). And with a bit of commitment and a lot of effort, I was able to increase my flexibility by a surprising amount in just 4 weeks! Hope you enjoy the video and find some value in it!\n\nThis is my first time ever doing something like this (recording, editing, and speaking in a video) and even though it was a difficult, slightly embarrassing, and sometimes frustrating process, I quite enjoyed it and I'm proud of the end result!

It originally aired from January 3, 1993 to June 2, 1999, in syndication, spanning 176 episodes over seven seasons. The fourth series in the Star Trek franchise, it is the third after Star Trek: The Original Series. Set in the 24th century, when Earth is part of a United Federation of Planets, its narrative is centered on the eponymous space station Deep Space Nine, located adjacent to a wormhole connecting Federation territory to the Gamma Quadrant on the far side of the Milky Way galaxy.\nThe main setting of Deep Space Nine is a space station near the planet Bajor, built by the imperialistic Cardassians during their long, brutal occupation of Bajor. After liberating themselves through a guerrilla war, the Bajorans invite the United Federation of Planets to jointly administer the station. The station is renamed Deep Space Nine, and a Starfleet crew is assigned to manage it, led by Commander Benjamin Sisko.\nShortly after his arrival, Sisko discovers a stable wormhole in Bajoran space between the Alpha Quadrant and the unexplored Gamma Quadrant, and the station is moved near the wormhole's entrance. The wormhole is the home of powerful, non-corporeal aliens whom the Bajorans worship as \"the Prophets\". Sisko is revered by the Bajorans as the Prophets' \"Emissary\"; although he is initially uncomfortable with being a religious figure, he gradually grows to accept his role.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright by Hollywood Update\n\u261e Thanks for watching", "date": "Dec 30, 2021", "views": "346,151 views", "comments": "323", "likes": "3,499 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 481, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1qXuoMpOP4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMkmjg-qZRk": {"title": "Batman | Behind The Scenes of The Dark Knight Trilogy | Warner Bros.

I do know that I\u2019ve missed some of the full clips from the ZoeMobile episode because the full episode is no longer on YouTube due to copyright issues and there was a few more scenes of Elmo getting upset at Zoe in that episode which was before the Alaska meme and after that which may probably be the angriest Elmo has ever felt in that hilarious episode which is no where to be found, but at least I uploaded the short clip of Elmo yelling at Zoe for not letting him have a turn driving her ZoeMobile and wants to go to Alaska. Besides that, I think this is pretty much all the clips from Sesame Street I\u2019ve got of Elmo losing his temper as this will do for now for everyone to see here.\n\nI hope you guys enjoy this full compilation of Elmo getting upset guys and feel free to make memes or funny edits of any of these clips whenever you want depending as long it\u2019s not done way too much to the point where I would have to recommend crediting me before posting them like that as I was the one who created this full and quite hilarious compilation. This was a whole lot of fun to make as I wanted to make this for ages and now it\u2019s finally here for everyone to see!\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: This video is NOT for Kids! (to avoid getting comments disabled from stupid COPPA on Sesame Street videos like this where we can\u2019t comment our opinions and childhood memories of our favorite Sesame Street Muppet characters/episodes we love during our childhood). Please don\u2019t repost this whole compilation video without giving me credit, but making memes and funny edits of this is perfectly fine as long it\u2019s not done way too often much where you would have to give credit.

Every time they migrate they must pack the whole tent away, drag it across the tundra on sledges, and erect it again in a fresh place, sometimes in temperatures of minus thirty degrees. Survival depends on working together as a team.\n\nAfter staying in the wooded taiga for two months they start to migrate north following the ancient paths of migrating reindeer (caribou). In four months they will travel up to 1200km and must pack and move every three to five days to keep up with their herd. They must reach their summer quarters before the snows melt and flood great rivers with icy waters too cold and deep for the calves, born along the way, to cross. \n\nBehind the tent an invisible line extends out into the tundra. It is called the sawei line, and a woman cannot cross it. It will bring bad luck to the tent. It was hard for them to explain exactly why, it is much stronger than a superstition and is connected to the spirit pole that stands at the back of the tent. This pole is sacred and a woman cannot cross underneath it either, and only a shaman may sit in this holy place. The origins of this are a little lost, there may be practical reasons, for example the back of the tent is traditionally where the men work, often together, so they have to be able to move about freely, but there are often two families in a single tent, so maybe one day the women just agreed territories to stop tripping over each other. Maybe it has such a mundane origin, or maybe there are real spirits that come up to the tent from behind and would bring harm to any women caught in the wrong place. If several tents pitch together, their lines must not cross either, so they tend to camp in a straight line to avoid this.\n\nIn answer to the many questions -  on personal hygiene, everyone washes using a bowl of soap and hot water, just like most of our grandparents did before everyone had pipes and taps. There is no toilet in the tent as some have suggested, they find a spot a few hundred metres away. They are not pitching on a lake but a small mound where the snow blows a little thinner, Gas companies have been in the area and gave away snowmobiles as part of land access negotiations. Also sometimes there are competitions with them as prizes, sometimes they sell a load of reindeer and buy one. Most families now have at least one but the reindeer are still used a lot. Yes, they use a sled to go to town, or trading posts to buy groceries.\n\n\nI wanted to catch the entire process, but have edited it down a little from the 40-45 minutes it takes to get from the open snows to a warm cosy home.\n\nBuy our book here:  ", "date": "Feb 10, 2021", "views": "16,723,013 views", "comments": "14,039", "likes": "229,089 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1933.801, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gI6q4R8ih4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2mOn8NoR84": {"title": "Worlds Strongest Arms VS Rock Climbing", "content creator": "Magnus Midtb\u00f8", "description": "NEW T-SHIRTS & MORE!!!  \u25ba rungne.com/collections/all\n\n@Devon Larratt     @Juji & Tom     @Anton Fomenko  \n\nVideo credit: \nDevon Larratt video highlights cc ", "date": "Apr 12, 2020", "views": "5,051,702 views", "comments": "4,378", "likes": "82,088 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2001.201, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2mOn8NoR84"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcYb3z-C30": {"title": "pete davidson breaking character SNL", "content creator": "The People's Elixir", "description": "#petedavidson #SNL", "date": "Aug 21, 2021", "views": "2,527,157 views", "comments": "379", "likes": "60,917 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 391.861, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcYb3z-C30"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEr_yj-8MmM": {"title": "Avengers: Endgame Cast Answer 50 of the Most Googled Marvel Questions | WIRED", "content creator": "WIRED", "description": "Avengers: Endgame stars Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Danai Gurira, Don Cheadle and Chris Hemsworth answer 50 of the most Googled questions about Marvel.

Away from the 75th Victory Day parade and displays of military might, we meet the people of Russia. They tell us of a nation poised between tradition and the future. Filmmaker Juri Rescheto travelled through the giant country, meeting with ordinary Russians who share their everyday lives with him. They talk about their joys and sorrows, their hopes and needs, and their experiences - good and bad. The film shows intimate scenes from their homes and their workplaces, as well as glimpses of their political views, their standards of living, and their customs. The protagonists\u2019 personal situations are presented in relation to official Russian studies on the particular generation to which they belong.  \n\nIn Part 1 we go to a city halfway between Moscow and Novosibirsk to meet Jelena, who works as a surrogate mother in a children\u2019s home. Then we travel to the boreal forest in western Siberia to meet 16-year-old Veronika, who spends most of the year in a boarding school. Her parents are reindeer herders and members of the indigenous Khanty people. The generation of young adults in Russia is represented by Kirill, who holds down a normal job, but spends his free time practicing a dangerous hobby: no holds barred boxing.\n\nWatch Part 2 here: ", "date": "Jun 19, 2020", "views": "1,510,758 views", "comments": "2,559", "likes": "17,274 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2547.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfuDZEQjro8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6Rwc8lNn0k": {"title": "Police officer scams an IRS scammer with return phone call", "content creator": "NBC4 Columbus", "description": "The police officer received an urgent phone call from the IRS saying that he was going to be arrested unless he called back.

If you're coming here due to an invalid run from 2020, that was for a 1.16 run that was never on my Youtube and was done on \"fabric\"! People confuse them sometimes, as that run is not counted towards the leaderboard and the runs on my Youtube all were. Any records on my Youtube were beaten a long time ago though! Really awesome for memories sake :) I don't speedrun competitively anymore, and the records you'll see on my channel were before speedrunning Minecraft competitively was a huge thing, so don't take these half decent times too seriously haha\n\nThis was definitely a new experience. I had a lot of fun, but also a lot of headaches when trying to beat this record. I might start live streaming stuff like this in the future, although for now this was mostly a personal challenge for myself.
