Observers have suggested that illegal mining is now so widespread, black-market gold arguably supports the communities once subsistent on the very same mines they worked in before they shut down.\n\nThe lack of policing in the mines has seen the practice go on largely unabated. However, in the absence of law enforcement, the extensive network of abandoned mines beneath the region has become an arena to deadly gang warfare between rival factions. VICE News visited illegal mines near Johannesburg, to meet the Zama Zamas risking life and limb everyday in the violent struggle for South Africa's illegal gold.\n\nCheck out the VICE News beta for more: ", "date": "Mar 28, 2014", "views": "4,424,220 views", "comments": "2,491", "likes": "30,231 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 636.601, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQWFmy2A_k"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMAJ8vOMDg": {"title": "Davey Wreden: Playing Stories - Aalto University Games Now! -lecture series", "content creator": "Games Now!", "description": "Davey Wreden talks about Playing Stories.\n\nJump to:", "date": "Aug 31, 2016", "views": "21,067 views", "comments": "68", "likes": "730 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4857.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMAJ8vOMDg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJcJevvWGP8": {"title": "Three Short Arguments on The Secret of Monkey Island", "content creator": "Innuendo Studios", "description": "patreon: http://patreon.com/InnuendoStudios\ntumblr: http://innuendostudios.tumblr.com\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/InnuendoStudios", "date": "Feb 28, 2018", "views": "140,298 views", "comments": "412", "likes": "6,169 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1125.801, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJcJevvWGP8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N6y6LEwsKc&list=RDCMUC5fdssPqmmGhkhsJi4VcckA&start_radio=1&rv=4N6y6LEwsKc": {"title": "The Artist is Absent: Davey Wreden and The Beginner's Guide", "content creator": "Innuendo Studios", "description": "patreon: http://patreon.com/InnuendoStudios\ntumblr: http://innuendostudios.tumblr.com\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/InnuendoStudios", "date": "Jul 26, 2016", "views": "467,534 views", "comments": "1,051", "likes": "20,254 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1973.381, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N6y6LEwsKc&list=RDCMUC5fdssPqmmGhkhsJi4VcckA&start_radio=1&rv=4N6y6LEwsKc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmxIK9p0SNM": {"title": "Tomatoes, or How Not To Define \"Art\"", "content creator": "Innuendo Studios", "description": "patreon: http://patreon.com/InnuendoStudios\ntumblr: http://innuendostudios.tumblr.com\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/InnuendoStudios", "date": "Jan 2, 2017", "views": "373,232 views", "comments": "1,747", "likes": "22,432 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 706.401, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmxIK9p0SNM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGl12Sv9SNs": {"title": "We Don't Talk About Kenny: Telltale's Walking Dead Season 2", "content creator": "Innuendo Studios", "description": "patreon: http://patreon.com/InnuendoStudios\ntumblr: http://innuendostudios.tumblr.com\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/InnuendoStudios", "date": "Dec 1, 2015", "views": "1,911,268 views", "comments": "10,575", "likes": "70,824 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1357.801, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGl12Sv9SNs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN8bJb8biZU": {"title": "SLAPP Suits: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)", "content creator": "LastWeekTonight", "description": "After winning a legal battle involving a coal executive and a giant squirrel, John Oliver explains how SLAPP suits are designed to stifle public dissent.\n\nConnect with Last Week Tonight online... \n\nSubscribe to the Last Week Tonight YouTube channel for more almost news as it almost happens: ", "date": "Nov 10, 2019", "views": "19,665,676 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "396,409 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1584.201, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN8bJb8biZU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdOxBCpk39c": {"title": "The Cultural Riches of Islam | Islam Religious Documentary | Timeline", "content creator": "Timeline - World History Documentaries", "description": "This feature-length documentary examines Islam's rich and significant contribution to western art and culture\n\nPresenter and art critic, Waldemar Januszczak, sets out on an epic journey of discovery across the Muslim world from Central Asia to the heart of the Middle East and beyond.\n\nHe reveals a world of awe-inspiring architecture, spectacular Islamic treasures and a host of artists and craftsmen, bringing the largely unknown and fascinating story of Islamic art and architecture to the attention of the public.

Warmbier was released the following year, but he died of brain damage shortly after his return to the United States. Was he really the victim of torture?\n\nOtto Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2016 after being convicted of attempting to steal a propaganda poster during a trip to Pyongyang. Just over a year on he was dead, having been sent home to the US in a vegetative state. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been \"tortured beyond belief \" in North Korea. The US president blamed both the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the Obama administration for Warmbier\u2019s death - and Trump appeared before the media with the student\u2019s parents. This was at the peak of the North Korean missile crisis. Later, as relations between Trump and Kim Jong Un became warmer, the US president changed his tune. In 2019 Trump said that he believed that Kim did not know what happened to the US student much to the consternation of Warmbier\u2019s parents. \n\nWhat really happened to Otto Warmbier in North Korea? Veteran foreign correspondent Klaus Scherer sets out to try to find out. In the documentary, Scherer interviews a number of people with knowledge of the case who have been largely unheard up to now. He shows that a US court investigating a liability case against North Korea brought by Warmbier\u2019s parents also ignored important witnesses, who continue to cast doubt on the torture allegations. These include the coroner in Cincinnati who examined Warmbier\u2019s body. She believes that the account given by North Korean doctors is credible. They claim that Warmbier had inadvertently been given too high a dose of sedatives by prison staff. This, the medics say was the cause of his state of unresponsive wakefulness. Could Trump\u2019s initial torture charges simply have been motivated by political opportunism?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For a video game door to feel real, it takes a ton of challenging work. Video game doors have to interact seamlessly with their surroundings, make logical sense, and look good too. They have to strike a delicate balance between real-world accuracy and playability.\n\nAll these factors mean designing a door usually requires work from every department at a game company.\n\nDifferent types of doors require different amounts of work. And these same challenges crop up as you try to add almost any element to a game.\n\nLike any great piece of art, the blood, sweat, and tears that go into doors are often invisible. The best doors are the ones that work seamlessly, and go unnoticed.

We are presenting on RESEARCH and in no way is any of the information provided our own view or opinions. \n\nThis will be a lecture packed with the process vaccine developers must go through; which includes a preclinical phase and phases I-III. Including information about OPERATION WARP SPEED and how this has expedited the normally lengthy vaccine process. \n\nWe will then discuss how Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Astrazeneca vaccines work in the human body, preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and hopefully, ending this global pandemic. \n\nFinally-- Zach presents on all of the most current data that each of the vaccine companies have released outlining the vaccine procedure and how it will be administered, the vaccine efficacy (as a percentage), optimal storage temperature of the vaccine in order to remain viable, and the number of vaccine units these companies are capable of producing. We hope you enjoy this lecture and be sure to support us below!\n\nIMPORTANT INFO (MUST READ):\nOne thing to emphasize that wasn\u2019t harped on enough from this lecture is when these vaccines lead to an immunogenic reaction as we described above, which leads to formation of Memory B cells and Memory T cells. This is important because if we are exposed to the virus those memory cells are now primed and able to recognize and mount a powerful immune response against the virus. \n\nLASTLY, one additional point and clarification is when those cytotoxic T cells produce destructive molecules that damage host cells it\u2019s important to realize that those are memory cytotoxic T cells primed by the Vaccine that damage host cells that ARE INFECTED with the SARS-COV-2 virus, NOT CELLS processing the vaccine. \n\nBig Takeaway:\n1. Vaccine stimulates antibody production to protect against virus IF INFECTED.\n2. Vaccine stimulates development of memory T and B cells to protect against virus IF INFECTED.\n\nReferences |\nRegulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) COVID-19 Tracker", "date": "Premiered Dec 7, 2020", "views": "6,135,470 views", "comments": "4,915", "likes": "44,307 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2620.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35Idb_lCU4o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31ro-WQrkU": {"title": "The COVID-19 Vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca: What's in Them and How Do They Work?", "content creator": "ARUP Laboratories", "description": "Learn about the composition and delivery mechanism for the new classes of COVID-19 vaccines based on adenovirus from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca with Dr. Jonathan Genzen, COO of ARUP Laboratories and an Associate Professor at the University of Utah School of Medicine.", "date": "Mar 8, 2021", "views": "446,163 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "4,481 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 679.721, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31ro-WQrkU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osRo-yz1VQ8": {"title": "All Types of COVID-19 Vaccines, How They Work, Animation.", "content creator": "Alila Medical Media", "description": "How it works. mRNA vaccine (Pfizer, Moderna), DNA & Viral vector vaccines (Johnson & Johnson (J&J, JNJ), Oxford-AstraZeneca, Inovio, Sputnik V); protein/peptide vaccine (Novavax, EpiVacCorona), conventional inactivated (CoronaVac of Sinovac, Covaxin, Sinopharm).

How is this possible? From Writer/Director Sena Mourad Friedman, Executive Producer Will Lucas, Producer Erickson Blakney and sponsored by The Fair Housing Center comes the provocative new documentary ZIP CODE MATTERS which boldly asks the question and gets profound and insightful answers from the nation\u2019s leading policymakers, nonprofit executives, public health officials and social scientists, researchers, authors, and civil rights and social justice activists. Audiences will learn about the connection between ZIP Codes and the forecast for life outcomes. WATCH THE TRAILER.  \n\nWhere you live should not determine how long you live, but it does. In fact, health has more to do with place than doctors\u2019 visits. The odds are stacked against low-income communities and communities of color. Because of a legacy of racial and economic segregation, anti-immigrant policy, and a host of other historical \u201cisms\u201d, there are many communities in the United States where the neighborhood environment conspires to harm residents. These environments lack basic health-protective amenities like parks, grocery stores, decent schools, functioning transportation systems, affordable and decent housing, living wage jobs, and even potable water in some instances. Public systems are on life support, stranding residents in pressure cookers of stress. These neighborhood and community environments are not natural; they are manmade and can be unmade.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s residential segregation in the North, South, Midwest and West is not the unintended consequence of individual choices and of otherwise well-meaning law or regulation but of unhidden public policy that explicitly segregated every metropolitan area in the United States,\u201d asserts Richard Rothstein, author of The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America. Rothstein, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Civil Rights Activist Stella Adams are among the many experts featured in ZIP CODE MATTERS.\n\nAccording to The Fair Housing Center\u2019s Sena Mourad Friedman, Director of the film, \u201cThe idea for this project was born when someone challenged me to explain how in the world a ZIP Code could matter when it comes to life determinants. It hit me that if you grew up in a well-resourced neighborhood, you truly could not wrap your brain around how where you grow up matters to the success you have in your life.\u201d\n\nZIP CODE MATTERS FEATURES:\n\n  Richard Rothstein, Author, The Color of Law \n  Sherrod Brown, United States Senator, Ohio\n  Sherrill Frost-Brown, V.P.

This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.\n\nAlbert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s. Professor Al-Khalili repeats this critical experiment, posing the question does reality really exist, or do we conjure it into existence by the act of observation?\n\nElsewhere, we explore how the most famous law of quantum physics \u2013 The Uncertainty Principle \u2013 is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis.

Irene was thirteen at the time, and by several twists of fate, she survived. \n\n\u201cThere is a life force in all of us that you just want to live another day,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s survive this. We have to survive this.\u201d Irene shares her story of survival with hundreds of high school students every year. In this program, we listen in on her presentation to Woodson High School students as she shares a personal account of the events that lead to the Holocaust. She discusses her life as a child in Hungary, the changes she witnessed as the Nazis took power, and all manner of degradations imposed on the Jewish people. \n\nIrene describes how her family was ostracized from society and how the Jewish \u201cghettos\u201d were created. She discusses what her family did and did not know about Nazi practices across Europe and how the deportation of Jews worked. She recounts her arrival at the worst of all Nazi death camps \u2013 Auschwitz-Birkenau \u2013 and shares historic photos, taken by the Nazis, which capture the very day that her family arrived. She talks about the painful separation from her family and what it was like to be a prisoner at Auschwitz. \n\nAfter sharing the story of her liberation and rebuilding her life in America, Irene examines the questions of propaganda and humanity that surround the Holocaust. She helps students understand the importance of critical examination of information and comparing sources. She discusses how a basic lack of empathy and humanity toward each other can lead to cruel, and ultimately horrific, behaviors. Irene uses her experience in the Holocaust as a lesson for us all.\n\nA discussion guide is available at ", "date": "Jan 28, 2016", "views": "5,166,836 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "44,812 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3571.901, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayN-IhDYBBQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fURATK5Yt30": {"title": "Hindenburg Disaster - Real Footage (1937) | British Path\u00e9", "content creator": "British Path\u00e9", "description": "Footage of the German airship catching fire, crashing and burning to the ground: This original footage from the British Pathe archive shows impressive shots of the Hindenburg flying overhead on on Thursday, May 6, 1937, flying over its landing ground at Lakehurst, New Jersey, and then finally there is footage of the famous crash. 13 out of 36 passengers died, whilst 22 out of 61 crew members died, so many survived the disaster.\n\nWatch here the clip \"Death Jump - Franz Reichelt jumps off the Eiffel Tower\": ", "date": "Mar 24, 2016", "views": "13,449,980 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "250,890 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 309.641, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fURATK5Yt30"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsZy_SXfTS0": {"title": "PragerU and Tradition: The Conservative Utopia | Big Joel", "content creator": "Big Joel", "description": "In this video, I'm gonna talk about Yoram Hazoney's fascinating PragerU video, \"What Was The Enlightenment.\" Who knows maybe this one will slap.\n\nSupport me on Patreon: ", "date": "Jun 14, 2020", "views": "788,366 views", "comments": "3,837", "likes": "38,861 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 987.381, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsZy_SXfTS0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KioF1sTQFtE": {"title": "Independence Day vs. War of the Worlds", "content creator": "Lindsay Ellis", "description": "A comparison of alien invasion movies from two very different cultures.\n\nGet started with a 30-day Audible trial when you go to https://www.audible.com/lindsayellis or text lindsayellis to 500500 and LISTEN for a change. \n\nThis is an idea I stole from Dan Olson of Folding Ideas - in effect, this is a remake of a video I did five years ago that hasn\u2019t been online for a while, like a second edition, an updated version of a textbook.

How did we get here? How did the first living organism come about? Can it have happened spontaneously? Isn't life way too complex for that to happen? It seems ridiculous, right? Well, no. Not if you understand biochemistry, which creationists do not. But every once in a while, a hero emerges from academia to champion the cause of the creationist, and lend some illusory credence to their views. In this case, that hero is James Tour, a synthetic organic chemist who insists that abiogenesis is impossible, and he should know better than anyone, because he's a chemist. I was made aware of Dr. Tour after a couple hundred people linked me to a video of his in an empty argument from authority, insisting that because a chemist confirms their religious bias, they must be right. But is Dr. Tour a bit biased himself? Let's find out precisely what his agenda is, shall we?\n\nUpdate: James Tour responded to this single video with a dumpster fire of a 14-part series overflowing with stupidity and lies, which qualifies for the Dunning-Kruger Hall of Fame. Naturally I tore through it like tissue paper, so to watch me do that please check out my two-part response which exposes his fraudulence ten times more thoroughly than this video:\nPart 1: ", "date": "Aug 28, 2020", "views": "516,491 views", "comments": "5,219", "likes": "10,384 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2760.781, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SixyZ7DkSjA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkGXAu3KOBs": {"title": "How I accidentally won a pokemon tournament", "content creator": "Ludwig", "description": "WATCH ME LIVE \u25ba https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig\nfollow me on twitter \u25bahttps://www.twitter.com/ludwigahgren\nfollow MY COACH \u25bahttps://www.twitter.com/JiveTimeVGC", "date": "Jan 18, 2020", "views": "2,860,622 views", "comments": "2,084", "likes": "77,895 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2731.301, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkGXAu3KOBs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqhyyqvt7Bg&list=RDCMUCrPseYLGpNygVi34QpGNqpA&start_radio=1&rv=Bqhyyqvt7Bg": {"title": "How I Accidentally Won a Chess Tournament", "content creator": "Ludwig", "description": "WATCH ME LIVE \u25ba https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig\nfollow me on twitter \u25ba https://www.twitter.com/ludwigahgren\nfollow me on tiktok \u25ba https://www.tiktok.com/@ludwigahgren", "date": "Sep 2, 2021", "views": "1,385,761 views", "comments": "1,375", "likes": "64,958 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1715.881, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqhyyqvt7Bg&list=RDCMUCrPseYLGpNygVi34QpGNqpA&start_radio=1&rv=Bqhyyqvt7Bg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZyxTr52lfw": {"title": "Schlatt loses a chess Meme 8 BIT", "content creator": "SON", "description": "Schlatt loses a chess meme 8 bit.
