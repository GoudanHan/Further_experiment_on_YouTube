Like many animals, cats are largely guided by their sense of smell; and if an object smells like you, they want to be near it because it makes them feel safe and content. \nAnother reason cats like to sit on your items is because they're very territorial. When cats walk over your stuff, they transfer their pheromones  to the object, giving it a scent that's uniquely theirs. This is a cat\u2019s way to establish their ownership. \nAnd remember, cats are intelligent animals, so they know that whatever you\u2019re reading is taking up all your attention\u2014and that\u2019s the very attention they want for themselves. So they\u2019ll sit or walk right over your stuff so that you\u2019ll have to focus on them. \nWhy cats sneer\nThis phenomenon has a scientific name; It\u2019s called the Flehman response. And this behavior isn\u2019t limited to domestic cats. Many other mammals, including lions and horses perform this action too. \nWhen a cat displays the Flehmen response, they\u2019re basically analyzing a particular scent.\nThis response lets the scent travel along the roof of the mouth where a specialized sensory structure known as the vomeronasal organ is located.\nWhy cats don\u2019t always cover their waste\nIn the wild, weaker and smaller cats bury their excrement to eliminate odors and prevent attracting the attention of predators.\nDominant cats that are competing for territory, such as leopards, lions, and tigers, often don\u2019t bury their feces, sending a message that they are declaring that the area is theirs. Mountain lions even build a little hill using dirt and leaves and then deposit their poop on top.\nWhen a domesticated cats suddenly chooses not to bury their waste, they may want to let other cats know about their presence.\nYour cat may also not bury their waste if they don\u2019t like the texture or smell of the litter. Painful medical problems, like a urinary tract infection or a sore paw, might also make a cat want to poop outside litter box. \nWhy cats blep\nBlepping is when your cat sticks their tongue out of their mouth. \nExperts say blepping is the way cats investigate their surroundings, using their sense of taste to understand what\u2019s going on around them.\nBlepping may also happen when the cat forgets to put their tongue back in after eating or grooming. It can happen when you distract them in the middle of an eating or grooming session. \nWhy kittens freeze when grabbed by the neck\nAt one time or another you\u2019ve probably witnessed a mother cat carrying her kittens around by the scruff of their neck. This form of transport is known as scruffing. \nThey can do that because kittens have a reflex in which their bodies go totally limp when picked up by the scruff. \nThe scruff was designed by nature as a handle to transport kittens from one place to another. \nWhy cats follow you everywhere in the house\nIf you live with a feline, you\u2019ll have noticed that they follow you everywhere. \nMore often than not, cats follow us around because they like our companionship. Contrary to what many people believe, cats love being with their human companions. \nAnother reason why cats follow you is because they want to be entertained. It's common for felines to be bored because they often spend all their time indoors. \nCats may also follow you when they are patrolling their territory. They want  to spread their scent, and to find possible intruders. \nWhy cats hate closed doors\nIf you have ever closed a door behind your cat, you probably know that a closed room is something that cats hate. \nCats may be attracted to closed doors because they want to know what is happening on the other side of it, especially if they hear or smell something that piques their curiosity.\nPawing at your closed door also indicates that your pet enjoys your company and wants to hang out with you.  \nAnd keep in mind that some cats don\u2019t like closed doors because of their territorial nature. Cats believe they actually own your house and they get confused when part of their territory is closed off from them.\nWhy cats pee outside the litter box\nThe state or quality of the litter in the box is usually the reason of out-of-box urination. Cats are very clean animals, and they don\u2019t like visiting a litter box that is not regularly cleaned. \nThe proper litter box set up will offer your feline peace and privacy, but it must still be easy for your cat to access.\nUrine-marking is another reason cats may urinate out of the litter box.\nStress or medical issues are also a huge factor when it comes to house-soiling issues.", "date": "May 14, 2021", "views": "6,883,096 views", "comments": "5,561", "likes": "125,126 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 590.341, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m5GJYlQ2sw", "id": "-m5GJYlQ2sw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC1ZQ7WGAto": {"title": "God's Not Dead 2: The Escalation of Christian Propaganda | Big Joel", "content creator": "Big Joel", "description": "In this video, I examine the film \"God's Not Dead 2\".

In Their divine wisdom they gave the players of skyrim the most overpowered spell imaginable and said that they could have it from as early as level 1. So how on earth can a player beat skyrim with only necromancy a skill which is exceedingly limited and has few overpowered gameplay features. Well it turns out that the ritual stone will make a skyrim necromancy only challenge not just easier but it will turn the game into a walk in the park.  You can take a level 1 character and turn them into the most powerful character in the entirety of the elder scrolls universe. So lets see if The Spiffing Brit can prove if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game or if spiff can exploit skyrim and beat the game with only necromancy. \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this Skyrim Necromancy only challenge!

This time, he's reviewing half of the fatalities in the game.\nDr. Wagner is here to let us know: is that skull model realistic? If a body were cut in half, how much intestine would we REALLY see? Did the Mortal Kombat creators really model every single bone in the spinal column? Find out just how deep this game's developers went in their research on human anatomy!\nThe 37 fatalities are performed on Nurse D'Vorah for monetization... so that blue blood is pretty normal.\nSee you in a few months for the second half of these fatalities!\n\n\nIn the Mortal Kombat series of fighting games, a Fatality is a special finishing move that can be used against one's opponent at the end of the final match. When the announcer says \"Finish Him\", or \"Finish Her\" if the opponent is female, the player can choose to kill him or her through a fatality move. If input correctly, the background will darken, followed by the desired result.\nIn the first game, the fatalities were pretty tamed, just a simple decapitation or ripping his heart off. But after 29 years, the Mortal Kombat developers have found so many varied and over-the-top ways to kill the characters that now, every single one of them is a true spectacle to behold.\n-------------------- \nCheck out Dr. Jordan Wagner on YouTube AND follow him on Instagram.\nDr. Jordan Wagner: ", "date": "Jun 17, 2021", "views": "8,756,918 views", "comments": "7,170", "likes": "155,733 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1439.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny_zTN_LeUA", "id": "ny_zTN_LeUA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrVIX0dItVg": {"title": "Kyogre's cry slowed down sounds like something from a nightmare", "content creator": "Kyogre", "description": "", "date": "Dec 30, 2021", "views": "187,031 views", "comments": "423", "likes": "7,125 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 18.561, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrVIX0dItVg", "id": "FrVIX0dItVg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl_if3NzoC0": {"title": "Karen thinks \"Women Can't be Pulled Over\"", "content creator": "AugustTheDuck", "description": "Today, we look at a Mega Karen, a true boss battle Karen.
