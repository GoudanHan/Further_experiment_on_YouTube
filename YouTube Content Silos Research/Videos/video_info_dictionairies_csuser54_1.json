Filmed in 1929, at the time of the Civil War the two men would have been 16 years old and 26 years old when the war started in 1861.  \n\nThe General Price they mentioned is none other than General Sterling Price:\n\nOn August 10, 1861, at the Battle of Wilson's Creek outside Springfield, Price\u2019s and McCulloch\u2019s combined force defeated Lyon, forcing the federals\u2019 withdrawal. At Wilson\u2019s Creek, Lyon earned the unenviable distinction of being the first Union general killed in the war. In September, Price marched northward, driving from the border counties Kansas Jayhawkers under the command of James H. Lane. Price then marched to Lexington, where his army besieged and forced the surrender of a 3,500-man fortified garrison of federal troops and Home Guard under James A. Mulligan.\n\nPressed by troops under John C. Fr\u00e9mont, commander of the Department of the West, Price soon retreated into the southern counties, where he attended the \u201crump session\u201d of the legislature and voted for secession in Neosho. After a brief occupation of central Missouri, Price and his state troops went into winter camp near Springfield, where they transferred into Confederate service and in February withdrew to Arkansas.\n\nThis video is made for educational purposes for fair use under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976.", "date": "May 1, 2021", "views": "1,329,507 views", "comments": "4,978", "likes": "40,270 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 126.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTf44Wwa2Fo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGRZ0rc9r1M": {"title": "Don't steal a banana out of an orangutan's mouth...", "content creator": "Juri Volta", "description": "Follow my channel \ud83d\udc35\ud83c\udf4c:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jurivolta/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@jurivolta ", "date": "Dec 9, 2018", "views": "21,985,233 views", "comments": "31,896", "likes": "330,369 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 12.381, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGRZ0rc9r1M"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQNyzbMTEQY": {"title": "Reasons NOT to Work in Japan", "content creator": "SHUNchan", "description": "Hey guys!

With the explosion started a system of which we are a part today. The afterglow of this tremendous and unexpected expansion of the cosmos can still be seen. With the help of science, we have been able to see a glimpse of how it all started but there is something that is promising to tell us that what happened in the next chapter of the early universe. Until now, there were many mysteries that could not be solved but now with the new James Webb Space Telescope, we will be able to peer back in time and space to see the very first stars and galaxies that formed from hot, dense clumps of gas and dust. Welcome to Cosmos lab, your one station for all the news from space. Join us in today\u2019s video to find out about the five mysteries of this universe that are about to be solved.\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is a billion-dollar project. The JSWT is a project that took decades in the making \u2014 basically the entire lifetime of astronomer Laura Kreidberg. She says the new telescope will help scientists study the atmospheres of planets far beyond our solar system. Now, as the project has been launched, the eyes are all set to the next step. Here are five big questions scientists hope the James Webb Space Telescope will help them answer, from the beginning of time to now.\nNumber five. What did the first galaxies and stars look like? JWST is sometimes described as a replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope. Hubble has been in operation for more than 30 years, providing us with breathtaking views of the universe as well as tens of thousands of scientific findings. We hope and expect it will continue to operate for many years to come. However, it was unable to detect the faintest of objects.\nThe James Webb Telescope on the other hand will be able to observe wavelengths of light from the very earliest stars and galaxies. It may even be able to see Population III stars (stars that formed from primordial material from the Big Bang) which have never been glimpsed before.\nThe universe was a boiling cloud of energy and seething plasma for the first 300,000 years or so, known as the cosmic \"dark age,\" where light couldn't penetrate. As the cosmos expanded and cooled over the following billion years, the first stars pumped forth hydrogen and helium, altering the plasma around them. Those first stars would have looked nothing like the ones we see now. We have been unable to see them but now with the James Webb in space, the scientists are hoping to get a glimpse of those stars and galaxies.\nKnowing when the first stars were formed, shortly after the Big Bang, and how they produced the building blocks of the first galaxies is a crucial scientific subject, and one of JWST's key science goals. However, studying the first stars and galaxies is not the only scientific program JWST will perform.\nNumber four. Why are there supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies? Black holes are one of the biggest space mysteries. A supermassive black hole, millions to billions of times the mass of our Sun, lurks at the heart of every galaxy. The first image of gas swirling around the edge of a black hole six and a half billion times the mass of the Sun at the center of the M87 Galaxy was acquired in 2019. However, we have no idea how creatures like this black hole came to be.\nNobel laureate John Mather of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center who is leading the project said, \"One way that it could happen is that the first generation of stars made small black holes, and then those small black holes started to swallow up either other stars or gaseous material, or dark matter or whatever is out there to eat,\"\nThe scientists don\u2019t know how the black holes grew up to be millions and billions of times the mass of the Sun. However, this mystery is on the list of the most powerful telescope ever.\nNumber three. How are new stars in the Milky Way born? A vast cloud of gas and dust known as a nebula is where stars are formed. The Hubble Space Telescope has collected breathtaking photographs of these star nurseries in the Milky Way throughout the years. It's difficult to see what's going on beneath the clouds since nebulas are so dusty. The iconic Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula is one of the most famous Hubble Space Telescope photographs.\n\njames webb telescope, james webb telescope explained, james webb telescope mission, james webb telescope, james webb telescope technology, nasa, nasa mission, nasa missions", "date": "Dec 29, 2021", "views": "133,914 views", "comments": "373", "likes": "1,459 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 588.101, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SChSV6HuNgA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7XbINJj5D0": {"title": "Sarnia, Ontario, Canada", "content creator": "BeaverCreekPictures", "description": "From the series Sketches Of Our Town  Produced by Conrad Beaubien\nOriginal music Rene Brossard - https://renebrossard.bandcamp.com/alb...\nCanadian Cities History", "date": "Dec 31, 2021", "views": "30,490 views", "comments": "49", "likes": "415 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1445.321, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7XbINJj5D0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEyp2p-bzcU": {"title": "Flight attendant performs funniest safety routine", "content creator": "Newsflare", "description": "I wish all flight attendants did this! \ud83d\ude02\n\nThis footage is being managed exclusively by Newsflare.

Investors are already suggesting it\u2019s worth about $10 billion.\n\nThe people valuing Trump\u2019s enterprise at this price are everyday stock pickers. They still can\u2019t purchase shares in the Trump Media and Technology Group, but they can buy stock in a pile of cash\u2014also known as a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC\u2014that plans to merge with Trump\u2019s business. News of the merger sent shares in the SPAC soaring from about $10 to $60 apiece over the last four weeks.\n\nIf the stock remains at $60, the SPAC shareholders will be left with an estimated $2.2 billion interest in the combined company after the merger. Investors in 15 million warrants tied to the SPAC will be sitting on another $300 million. The current owners of Trump\u2019s company\u2014it\u2019s not yet clear what the former president\u2019s personal interest is in the business\u2014will receive an estimated 86 million shares as part of the deal, worth $5.1 billion. And, assuming shares consistently stay above $30 over the course of about a month and a half after the merger, the owners of Trump\u2019s group will receive an additional 40 million shares, worth $2.4 billion at today\u2019s prices.
