Well, we\u2019ve gone for range-topping editions of all cars, apart from the first car Mat\u2019s in - the Mustang Mach-E. Sadly, we could only get our hands on the entry-level version for this video. However, everything else in the line-up is top-of-the-range! And what a line-up it is...\n\nAudi Q4 e-tron\nSkoda Enyaq\nBMW iX3\nHyundai IONIQ 5\nKia EV6\n\nSo which do you think will go the furthest?

This individual, always on the line between good and evil, I mean we saw that in his little project, he had this dark, and light theme, and this sort of line between them, but the thing is you can\u2019t easily manufacture such a character, unless you\u2019re a real artist, and the problem was that Greg clearly integrated a lot of his own personal investments into this character, a lot of strange desires that didn\u2019t merely involve him, and ultimately that led to people being hurt. Movies are often movies for a reason, we may idolise some characters, we may even see parts of ourselves in the worst people, but self-control is a necessary constituent that should be exercised, especially when you\u2019re a public figure with great responsibility. \n\nThe way that Onision had cultivated his audience gave him an even greater responsibility than many creators, because his audience were highly committed to him as a personality, and would likely be heavily influenced by his behaviour. He had carved out this corner on the internet that was relatively isolated from reality. Onision was never interested in responsibility, and over time, he had managed to isolate various people who bought into his doctrine more closely, and did, for a significantly amount of time, whether by luck or by judgement, get away with it. \n\nAs mentioned at the end of the last video, by September 2019, the tides were beginning to turn, instigated by many people, but brought forward by a person named Sarah primarily, arguably the most concerning example of the people that he involved in his life. A lot of people at this point had already been dunking on Onision, he was a popular target that accumulated views, but this was what finally pushed many people over the top with their criticisms, and it went from \u201cLook at this dude\u201d, to \u201cLook at this dude\u201d. These criticisms have mostly amounted to focusing on his behaviour, although there are many actions that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.", "date": "Feb 27, 2020", "views": "3,891,671 views", "comments": "8,684", "likes": "79,010 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5551.741, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZlNZyasroo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRupA2nyEpQ": {"title": "Summit Everest 2019, may 23", "content creator": "ITCOG", "description": "GoPro video shot on the summit of Mount Everest, May 23rd 2019", "date": "Jun 10, 2019", "views": "2,298,524 views", "comments": "3,519", "likes": "38,068 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 64.481, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRupA2nyEpQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt87_K5atko": {"title": "Eating All Meals at a 7-Eleven in Singapore", "content creator": "DancingBacons", "description": "7-Eleven in Singapore is a 24 hours convenience store where you can find affordable and easy to prepare hot meals\n\n7-Eleven food in this video\n1.

Referring to the 97% of the world\u2019s money supply that is represented by credit, this thought-provoking film presents serious research and verifiable evidence on our economic and financial system. Featuring frank interviews and commentary from economists, campaigners and former bankers, it exposes the privatized, debt-based monetary system that gives banks the power to create money, shape the economy, cause crises and push house prices out of reach. Fact-based and clearly explained, 97% Owned demonstrates how the power to create money is the piece of the puzzle that economists were missing when they failed to predict the crisis.\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: ", "date": "Nov 27, 2020", "views": "1,567,190 views", "comments": "2,888", "likes": "22,074 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6239.681, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7-FmAfxMmQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt04MiGUTdw": {"title": "Tom Holland, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Visits Kids at Children's Hospital Los Angeles", "content creator": "Children's Hospital Los Angeles", "description": "Tom Holland, who plays Peter Parker in the upcoming superhero movie SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, swung by to visit some of our kids at Children's Hospital Los Angeles!\n\nRead more about his visit: ", "date": "Jun 2, 2017", "views": "87,485,730 views", "comments": "32,290", "likes": "995,393 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 138.721, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt04MiGUTdw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPySn3slfXI": {"title": "Brain Man: The Boy With The Incredible Brain (Superhuman Documentary) | Real Stories", "content creator": "Real Stories", "description": "Brain Man: The Boy With The Incredible Brain (Superhuman Documentary) | Real Stories\n\nAn extraordinary documentary on the brainpower of Daniel T, the young Englishman who could be the world\u2019s greatest mental athlete.

Most lawyers do.  It is just a great movie that involves great lawyering.  Everyone should watch this movie.  But the question is: Is Vinny Gambini a good lawyer?  We'll find out today.\n\nThe movies starts with two students driving through the South on their way to California. Once they arrive in Alabama, they stop at a local convenience store to pick up a few snacks. The store clerk is murdered just after they leave and, in a case of mistaken identity, they are fingered for the crime.  Facing execution, the students do not have enough money for a lawyer, so they hire their cousin, Vincent Laguardia Gambini (Joe Pesci). After failing the bar 5 times, Vinny has been a lawyer for about six weeks and has to learn the process on the job.  Vinny has to defend his clients and battle an uncompromising judge, some tough locals, and even his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei).   \n\n(Thanks to Indochino for sponsoring this video and helping to make this channel possible)\n\nNew episodes weekly!

But she cared about food: where it came from, how it was made, and what it did to her body. So she set herself a challenge: She would go an entire year without eating processed foods. In this talk, she discusses what makes a food processed and how those processes impact our bodies and communities.\n\nMegan Kimble is the managing editor of Edible Baja Arizona, a local food magazine serving Tucson and the borderlands, and is a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times. Her book, Unprocessed, about her year of eating only whole, unprocessed food, is forthcoming from William Morrow in 2015. Follow along at megankimble.com. \n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)", "date": "Aug 4, 2014", "views": "1,386,632 views", "comments": "1,049", "likes": "18,133 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 853.701, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ug1MnU6LKw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czcf5AurSAA": {"title": "Confronting Critical Race Theory and Wokeism - panel", "content creator": "University of Dallas", "description": "", "date": "Streamed live on Nov 3, 2021", "views": "8,047 views", "comments": "167", "likes": "245 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6368.381, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czcf5AurSAA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDotiRK-uys": {"title": "\u0634\u06cc\u0639\u0631\u06ce\u06a9\u06cc \u0628\u06d5\u0647\u06ce\u0632\u06cc \u0644\u0627\u0644\u06d5 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u06d5\u062f\u06d5\u0644\u06cc lala Muhammad barika dali", "content creator": "\u0645\u062d\u0647\u200c\u0645\u0647\u200c\u062f\u06cc \u062d\u0627\u062c\u06cc \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0647\u200c\u0641\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0643\u0647\u200c\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0631 Lala Muhammad", "description": "\u0644\u0627\u0644\u06d5 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u06d5\u062f\u06d5\u0644\u06cc \n\u0634\u0627\u0639\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0644\u06cc \u0643\u0648\u0631\u062f\n.\n\u0626\u06d5\u06af\u06d5\u0631 \u06a4\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u06c6\u06a9\u06d5\u062a \u0628\u06d5\u062f\u06b5\u0628\u0648\u0648 \u062a\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06d5 \u0633\u06d5\u0628\u0633\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0628\u06cc \u0686\u06d5\u0646\u0627\u06b5\u06d5\u06a9\u06d5\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u06a9\u06d5\u0646", "date": "Jul 2, 2021", "views": "5,539 views", "comments": "5", "likes": "213 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 42.701, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDotiRK-uys"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoV3EDzUP7Y": {"title": "Unparalleled Private Estate in Indianapolis, Indiana | Sotheby's International Realty", "content creator": "Sotheby's International Realty", "description": "Presented by Encore Sotheby's International Realty\n\nFor more information go to https://s.sir.com/34wdgHH", "date": "Jan 9, 2022", "views": "152,012 views", "comments": "259", "likes": "3,311 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 137.801, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoV3EDzUP7Y"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujEc4uqut9Y": {"title": "Shaquille O'Neal vs Dennis Rodman Heated Moments Comp", "content creator": "BBall Vault", "description": "Rodman and Shaq would constantly get into altercations while playing against each other.

One evening after hours, he finds himself alone with the affluent but mistreated Josie McClellan (Connelly).\n\nHughes chose Bryan Gordon to direct his screenplay after he was impressed with one of Gordon's short films.

I packed out minimal gear, built a natural shelter, and slept next to a long fire with only a  foam sleep pad and one wool blanket.\nIt was a lot of fun and I had a great time. I stayed plenty warm despite the temperature getting down to -26\u00b0C (-15\u00b0F). I have figured out a way to make a very effective long fire and I will make a video on this method in the near future.\nCooking in these extreme cold temperatures can be tricky. I try to bring out food that won't freeze which is exactly what I did on this trip. I still had a delicious supper that filled my belly and was simple to make.\n\nThank you to everyone who watches. If you feel like supporting the channel be sure to hit the thumbs up button.\n\nEXTRA INFO:\n\nAre there wild animals in this area?\nYes. There's a variety of big game (moose, deer, grizzly bears, black bears, cougars, wolves) in this area. They tend to avoid humans for the most part though and don't pose much of a threat. I do carry a form of protection just in case.\n\nWhat clothes am I wearing?\nUpper body: cotton base layer, wool insulating layer, waxed cotton jacket (outer layer).\nLower body: cotton base layer, polyester insulating layer (I would like to have wool pants for insulation, but they are very expensive to buy.. I will likely make my own in the future), waxed cotton pants (outer layer).\n\nHow can I sleep in these cold temperatures?\nMy fire is the reason I stay warm. I build it to put off a lot of heat and I stoke it throughout the night (every 2-3 hours) so that I'm always getting heat. My wool blanket absorbs the heat from the fire and it feels like I'm sleeping under a heated blanket. It is very comfortable to sleep this way, as long as you don't mind waking up every few hours to put wood on the fire.\n\nGear that I use:\nBackpack - Kelty Redwing 44 - It's an ok pack. Comfortable enough to carry but it has a lot of flaws in it's design. I use it because it's all I have. One day I will replace it I'm sure.\n\nHatchet - This was an $8 antique store find. I put a new handle on it and it has been my go to for a couple years now. No makers mark on it so I'm not sure what brand it is but it holds an edge very well.\n\nKnife - Mora Carbon Steel - Mine has a custom wood handle I put on it. It's a great blade and works excellent for carving/crafting. It's inexpensive and is great quality. One of my best knives.\n\nSaw - Bahco 21\" Peg Tooth Blade - The wood frame I made myself. the blade is decent quality. Works quite well.\n\nBoots - Sorel Pac Boots (I think) - I don't know if the specific model I have is still available. But they're Sorel brand. Not the best boots. I have to wear thick wool socks to keep my feet warm and sometimes they still get cold. Once again though they're all I have so it's what I use.\n\nWool Blanket - Queen size 100% wool blanket - I received it as a gift and I believe it was bought second hand. No label or anything on it.\n\nSleep Mat - Cheapo foam sleep pad found in any camping store - It's just the typical foam sleep pad that most camping stores carry. Inexpensive but the warmest sleep pad I've used.

Chrome accents from the previous edition have been swapped with black, while a boot lip spoiler has been added to the back and the looks up front have been made sleeker. \n\nOnce you step inside, the biggest change is the introduction of the yoke steering wheel. The infotainment screen has also switched from portrait to landscape, and plush quality materials can be found throughout - no surprise given the price starts at \u00a396,000! \n\nHowever, the biggest change compared to the old model is the performance! With one motor up front and two at the back, the new Model S Plaid can deliver 1,020hp & 1,400Nm!! \n\nSo\u2026 Is it worth it? There\u2019s only one way to find out - stick with Mat for his latest in-depth review!\n\nChapters", "date": "Jan 14, 2022", "views": "1,197,611 views", "comments": "4,957", "likes": "44,190 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1060.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP0deOQkZtQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9kkXTucnLU": {"title": "YENA (\ucd5c\uc608\ub098) - SMILEY (Feat.

In a few short sentences, it outlines two diametrically opposed modes of being -- both responses to the emergence of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil detailed in story of Adam and Eve. \n\nCain's mode of being -- resentful, arrogant and murderous -- arises because his sacrifices are rejected by God. This means that his attempts to give up something valuable in the present to ensure prosperity in the future are insufficient. He fails, in consequence, to thrive, as he believes he should, and becomes bitter, resentful and murderous.\n\nAbel's mode of being is characterized, by contrast, by proper sacrifice -- by the establishment of balance between present action and future benefit. This ensures his personal and social success, accruing over time. Unfortunately, it also makes him the target of Cain's malevolence.\n\nThis great short story is relevant personally, on the level of the family, and politically, all with equal force, all simultaneously. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.
