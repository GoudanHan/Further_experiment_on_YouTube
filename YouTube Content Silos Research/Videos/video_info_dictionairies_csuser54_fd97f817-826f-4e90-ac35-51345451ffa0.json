It is exclusively made from barley, which is quite a cheap product. A bottle of The Macallan 1926 60-year-old recently sold for $1,512,000 in auction, marking the largest single sale ever for a bottle. Over the past 50 years, single malts have become increasingly popular. Scottish single malt exports grew by 14.2% in 2017 to reach nearly $1.5 billion.\n\nGlenfiddich distillery in Scotland is the world's largest exporter of single malt. Started in Dufftown in 1886, it ships 1.2 million 9-liter cases each year. \n\nMaking single malt is a difficult and lengthy process. Barley is ground down and added to spring water. Heated to 64\u00b0C, it turns to sugar, dissolving into a fine sweet, tangy liquid called wort. The wort is drained, cooled, and passed into wash-backs. This is heated and condensed in copper wash stills for its first distillation, and a second time in spirit stills. This spirit trickles into the spirit safe, ready for maturation, and then is batched in casks with spring water. Casks spend years in the warehouse, maturing into a single malt. \n\nAn aged 30-year maturation can have 30% to 40% of the alcohol evaporated in the barrel, or over 1% each year of the whisky\u2019s life. This is because of \"Angel's Share\" \u2014 the natural evaporation of the liquid into the atmosphere over time. So older whiskies are expensive not because they\u2019re old, but because they are rare. \n\nFashion, and the collector's market, also have something to do with the rise in popularity. Christie's Director of Wine Tim Tiptree oversaw the sale in 2018 of The Macallan 1926 60-Year-Old, which sold for $1,512,000 to a private buyer. According to Tim, the collector's market will continue to grow. \n\nIndia, China, and Japan, are now main players in the single malt market. Particularly successful is the Yamazaki distillery in Osaka prefecture. Rare whiskies from their collection of single malts now sell for thousands of dollars. \n\nWe tried a 12 year-old single malt worth $36, and the 50 year-old bottle worth $30,000.\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE CONTENT:\nWhy Foie Gras Is So Expensive | So Expensive", "date": "Mar 9, 2019", "views": "5,943,041 views", "comments": "2,813", "likes": "43,546 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 381.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QabHUUwC1tA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uznXI8wrdag": {"title": "How Mushrooms Are Turned Into Bacon And Styrofoam | World Wide Waste", "content creator": "Business Insider", "description": "A biotech company in upstate New York designs products made from the root structures of mushrooms.

It consists of a ring of standing stones, each around 13 feet (4.0 m) high, seven feet (2.1 m) wide, and weighing around 25 tons. The stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred tumuli (burial mounds).\nArchaeologists believe it was constructed from 3000 BC to 2000 BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the first bluestones were raised between 2400 and 2200 BC, although they may have been at the site as early as 3000 BC.\nOne of the most famous landmarks in the United Kingdom, Stonehenge is regarded as a British cultural icon. It has been a legally protected Scheduled Ancient Monument since 1882, when legislation to protect historic monuments was first successfully introduced in Britain. The site and its surroundings were added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1986. Stonehenge is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage; the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust.\nStonehenge could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings. Deposits containing human bone date from as early as 3000 BC, when the ditch and bank were first dug, and continued for at least another 500 years.\"\n\nFor lots more about this fascinating historical site, visit ", "date": "Jun 20, 2020", "views": "3,847 views", "comments": "78", "likes": "96 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 275.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYDWuBYH99c"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pfkUrMx4U4&list=RD7-1j5ySxzsk&start_radio=1&rv=7-1j5ySxzsk": {"title": "Adorable Baby Animals with Dave Salmoni & Keegan-Michael Key", "content creator": "Jimmy Kimmel Live", "description": "Dave Salmoni teaches Jimmy, Keegan and our audience about baby alligators, baby ostriches, a baby Hyrax, a baby alpaca and a baby giraffe.\n \nTo learn more about wildlife go to:\n \nAfrican Wildlife Foundation\n ", "date": "Sep 11, 2018", "views": "10,876,519 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "160,855 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 747.801, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pfkUrMx4U4&list=RD7-1j5ySxzsk&start_radio=1&rv=7-1j5ySxzsk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_4hiqiBxDQ": {"title": "Leslie Odom Jr. - Speak Now (Live at One Night In Miami Premiere)", "content creator": "Little Cinema", "description": "Leslie Odom Jr. celebrated the release of One Night in Miami with a live performance of his original song 'Speak Now' at the virtual premiere produced by Little Cinema. \n\n\nFind out more at littlecinema.net | @little.cinema\n\nPresented by: Amazon Studios\nProduced by: @little.cinema & Borderlight Entertainment\nExecutive Producers: Alex Stamm, Jay Rinsky\nDirector of Photography: Idan Menin\nLighting: Andrew Schmedake\nFirst AD: Courtney Therond\nProduction Designer: Darcy Scanlin\nEditors: Kristen Kiertzner, Nikita Belomestnykh\nLive Visuals: CHNNLS\n\nArtistic director: Melissa Garcia\nAudio supervisor: Kyle Mann\nAdditional arrangements: Theron \u201cNeff-U\u201d Feemster\nDrums: Trevor Lawrence\nKeys: Tommy King\nBass: Thomas Drayton\nGuitar: Phillip Meneses\nStylist: Avo Yermagyan\nBand Stylist: Darrell Jones\nHair: Annitria Wicker\nMakeup: Eliven Quiros", "date": "Jan 28, 2021", "views": "33,304 views", "comments": "39", "likes": "679 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 220.281, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_4hiqiBxDQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXj5d73siI": {"title": "Old Town Road Spoof by Greg Sykes Realtor // feat. 414 Harvest Rd and Chris P.
