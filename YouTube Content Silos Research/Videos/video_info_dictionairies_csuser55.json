What about joining massive protests and taking place in a would-be revolution? That\u2019s what happened in Kazakhstan on January 2nd when tens of thousands started taking to the streets in Almaty, the country\u2019s largest city over the removal of a fuel price cap. Over the week, they set fire to public buildings, stormed city hall, and violently clashed with security forces. But were such large protests all about fuel? Yes and No. For years there has also been anger at the country\u2019s officials and fuel prices were just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. In particular, many people were angry at the former president, a man who ruled the country since independence until 2019 and gained the title of \u201cFather of the Nation.\u201d Since \u201cretiring,\u201d he has been the head of the Security Council, leading many to believe that his hand-picked successor Kassym-Jomart Tokayev was nothing more than a puppet and weak leader. But over the last week, Tokayev shed that image. He used the unrest to oust the former president and his allies from power completely, riding off of popular anger at the \u201cold guard.\u201d And despite initially seeming compliant with protester demands, right, like promising to reintroduce price caps for fuel, he quickly 180\u2019d.\nThe internet was shut off for some time - which actually shows how interconnected the world is, because Kazakhstan is the second-largest producer of Bitcoin, and this shutdown heavily affected its price. But beyond that, the president went as far as ordering troops to shoot protesters. On top of that, he also asked members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization - imagine NATO but of former Soviet countries - to intervene. This has led Russia and five other countries to send over 2,000 troops to help quell the unrest. As of this morning, things have seemingly calmed down. The events reportedly have leftover 100 dead and thousands of arrests have been made. With no evidence, the President blamed the protests on foreign-trained terrorists and said on television, \u201cThe militants have not laid down their arms, they continue to commit crimes or are preparing for them. Whoever does not surrender will be destroyed. I have given the order to law enforcement agencies and the army to shoot to kill, without warning.\u201d And this rhetoric was also said in a meeting among CSTO members, with Russian president Vladimir Putin repeating the rhetoric. Putin also promised that no revolutions would happen in CSTO member states, while U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken urged Kazakhstan to respect protesters\u2019 rights to demonstrate. Blinken also warned that it might be hard to get Russian troops to leave Kazakhstan now that they\u2019ve been invited in. Those concerns have led some to ask \u201cIs the Crisis in Kazakhstan the Rebirth of the Soviet Union?\u201d Right, this isn\u2019t the first event in the region that has required interference. Russian troops are now on a peace-keeping mission in Armenia and Azerbaijan, stationed in Kazakhstan, were poised to help Belarusian authorities maintain power, and now amassing on the Ukrainian border. It now remains to be seen what will happen from here, and whether Putin will get some kind of Russian-dominated state or whether one of these Revolutions succeeds.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    \nProduced by: Cory Ray \nEdited by: James Girardier, Julie Goldberg, Maxwell Enright\nArt Department: William Crespo\nWriting/Research: Philip DeFranco, Brian Espinoza\nProduction Team: Zack Taylor, Emma Leid\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014", "date": "Jan 11, 2022", "views": "562,477 views", "comments": "1,442", "likes": "32,076 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 186.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPz2pgPf1-4", "id": "qPz2pgPf1-4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9smFev5JG0": {"title": "Not Ari and Jlaw texting each other during the don\u2019t look up interview \ud83d\ude2d #shorts", "content creator": "Moonlights aesthetic\ud83e\udd0d\ud83c\udf19", "description": "", "date": "Jan 9, 2022", "views": "819,088 views", "comments": "512", "likes": "44,827 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 14.241, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9smFev5JG0", "id": "U9smFev5JG0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frNxYWkZK5o": {"title": "HasanAbi reacts to Conservative and Liberal Tiktoks", "content creator": "HasanAbi Bits", "description": "HasanAbi reacts to Conservative and Liberal TikToks\n\nDesperate fan channel.

With the tournament swelling to 24 players and further expansion on the way, future changes were inevitable. The following players vied for six slots in the candidates matches to be held in 1971: William G Addison, Miroslav Filip, Robert James Fischer, Efim Geller, Svetozar Gligoric, Vlastimil Hort, Robert Huebner, Borislav Ivkov, Eleazar Jimenez Zerquera, Bent Larsen, Milan Matulovic, Henrique Mecking, Dragoljub Minic, Renato Naranja, Oscar Panno, Lev Polugaevsky, Lajos Portisch, Samuel Reshevsky, Jorge Alberto Rubinetti, Vasily Smyslov, Duncan Suttles, Mark Taimanov, Wolfgang Uhlmann, Tudev Ujtumen..\n\nUjtumen from Mongolia, about as outside as an outsider could get, actually held the lead by himself after round 3. However, reality and Robert J. Fischer set in, as the American quickly soared to a dominating position. The other contenders didn't worry about it too much; after all, you only had to finish in the top six to qualify for the Candidates, and there was even a seventh spot open for a reserve. So they played it safe, while Fischer kept working hard.\n\nAt the quarter pole following round 6, Fischer had 5.5 points and a 1.5 point lead on Geller, Gligoric, Larson, Panno, and Ujtumen. But then came a bad stretch: he managed to draw lost positions in round 7 and 8, but Larsen didn't let him off the hook in round 9. By now the lead had vanished, as Geller joined Fischer at the top with 6.5.\n\nThat led to the critical round 12 encounter between the leaders, Geller holding a half-point lead and playing the White pieces. Any normal grandmaster, when Geller offered an early draw, would have accepted to get an easy half-point closer to qualification. Fischer, hungry for a win after five rounds without one, refused.\n\nGeller played inaccurately and lost a pawn, reaching a difficult rook ending. Eventually, a hallucination and a final mistake sealed his fate, and Fischer took the lead. The rest was a matter of technique: Fischer won two more in a row, took a couple of draws for a breather, then started his famous streak with full points in his last seven games.\n\nRead more here ", "date": "Jul 18, 2018", "views": "3,502,856 views", "comments": "1,624", "likes": "43,493 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 634.501, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bcCob_MFA8", "id": "0bcCob_MFA8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g": {"title": "How to Know Your True Friends - Prof. Jordan Peterson", "content creator": "Jordan Peterson Fan Channel", "description": "Psychology professor Jordan B.

I really liked the unique look of it with the hook instead of a hole to hang it on the wall. As christmas holidays were just around to happen, I knew I had to pick a project that I have all the material ready in my shop, because everybody was in vacation. So i choose to restore this cleaver.\nThe disassembling was done very quickly, so was the sandblasting.\nThe original handle was held in place with the peened tang. I didn't really like the shape of the handle and I also didn't wanted to peen the handle again. Si I decided to make a more ergonomic nice looking handle. That's why I shortened the tang around 45mm and drilled three 5mm holes in it. That went very well as the tang wasn't hardened. Next I wanted to make it mirror polished. I startet with the belt sander to grind away all the pitting from the rust. Then it was time for hand sanding. I started with 120 grit, after all the scratches were gone from the belt sander I moved on with 240. Then 400, 1000 and 1200 at the end. I then had a fine enough surface to be able to mirror polish it on the cotton buffing wheel. It took quite some time to do that, but the end result came out absolutely amazing.\nMoving on to the handle. I decided to make a three part sandwich. I started by making a spacer out of smoked oak. Cut out the shape of the tang and then glue it on to a piece of pear tree wood. Then I was able to file the spacer to the same tapered thickness of the tang. After gluing the other side of the handle on and drilling the holes for the rivets through I could start to rough shape the handle with a rasp.\nI decided to make three screwable brass rivets. I applied some Loctite on the threads and tighten them together. After that I filed the slotted heads away, flush to the handle. Then it was time to give the handle a final sanding with 120, 240, 400 and 1000 grit and apply linseed oil for the final touch. And after sharpening this job was done completely.\nI really liked to work on this cleaver. Mirror poilishing was a lot of work and also the work on the handle was quite challenging, but I really liked the end result and I think it speaks for itself.\n\nI hope you like my work and the video.\n\nHuge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and specially to:\n\n\nTonya M Broerman\nZack Thompson\nAdel AlSaffar\nafreeflyingsoul\nYale Baker\nGregory\nAlex McGeorge\nAlistair Moor\nAmar.k\nAnthony Eufemio\nBendurion\nCourtney Maleport\nDavid Barker\nGreg Marston\nJosh Ledford\nJoshua Bentley\nLambda GPU Workstations\nLuke Schmick\nLuke Stone\nMatt Boothman\nMellissa Marcus\nMonte Gibbs\nMuzaffer Aksoy\nNick Houston\nPaul Mampilly\nPong Lenis\npotokslow\nSchultes Thomas\nThomas & Jenni Wendel\nTodd Medbury\nTyler Carruth\nVickie Bligh\nVince Valenti\nXavier Carbel\nYuri Zapuchlak\nAaron Quante\nAcechadora\nAjna\nAlex Breton\nAllen Frank\nAmanda Taylor, Esq\nAndreas Mimra\nAndrew Phillips\nAnthony Adams\nArni Bjorgvinsson\naudi4444player\nBlake T\nBrandon Fitzwater\nBrian Newton\nCarl Savage\nCarlo\nChad Bryant\nChris Simondet\nGrok Senften\nHaley McFadden\nHarper Kim\nHunter R.\nisioviel\nJason Koi\nJason Tarlov\nJeremy Cole\nJonas Richartz\njustin f.\nKelly Imgrund\nKurt Gazow\nMarc Cerisier\nMartin R\u00f8nnow Klarlund\nMellissa McConnell\nMichael Bier\nMickey Eisenhorn\nMike Donaldson\nNick Cannon\nPasacal Schmikal\nPhilipp\nRegis Vincent\nScott Marshall\nSejo Gavisch\nSergei Shvartsman\nStefan Halter\nSubramaniam Venkitaraman\nSuiros\nSvenja Kuckla\nTrevor Kam\nTucker Ifft\nWarren G Strand Jr\nWilliam Wallace\n\uc6c5\ub85d \uc724\n\n\nMy camera:\nPanasonic HC-VX11\n\nI payed a lot of attention on the lighting when filming this video and also the quality of the sound to create an ASMR style video.\n\nIf you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.
