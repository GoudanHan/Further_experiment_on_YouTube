It's also beneficial if you suffer from anxiety or depression. \n\nI became well versed in wholesome, anti-inflammatory foods several years ago when I embraced a whole foods diet. After being diagnosed with four autoimmune diseases in two years I realized my body was fighting massive immune system inflammation and I needed to provide reinforcements.

They were formed then ice sheet from the North Pole left behind vast areas of landscape, what we know today as North America. When the vast chunks of ice started to melt, the fall came into existence. When the glaciers melted, a considerable amount of water was sent into the Niagara River. It took a lot of time for the water to erode the cliffs, and the falls were formed. By the end of the 19the century, the world's first hydroelectric generating station was built near the falls. Soon, it started producing electricity. Unfortunately, the electricity could only carry 300-feet, so everyone knew that improvements had to be made. Nicola Tesla was the man who made those changes. He found a way to send electricity to long distances bu using alternating current. Today, the fall's power plants produce more than two million kilowatts of power.\n\nThe scientists wanted to see if it was possible to see what was going on behind the falls. They thought that if they could stop them from flowing, they could find out the mysteries behind them. Tempering nature is a challenge, and many people wondered if what the scientists had planned was even possible.  How is it possible to stop such a powerful force?                                                                                                                                                    \n\nThis may sound strange, but the amount of water changes at night. This isn't something that happens; naturally, it is due to a human factor. Local companies are allowed to take water from the falls, but only at night. During the '50s, the locals signed a treaty to take more water at night when there weren't too many tourists there, and they wouldn't notice a difference.                                                                      \n\nTechnically, the Niagara Falls belong to Canada and the United States. There are parts of the falls that belong only to the United States. The American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls are two parts of Niagara Falls, and they belong only to America. There are not parts of the falls that belong to Canada exclusively.     \n   \n It was believed that the stones that accumulate at the bottom of the falls could cause problems in the future. The concerns of the New York citizens reached Canada, and an organization that takes care of the shared waters was contacted. They are called the International Joint Commission, and they discovered that something had to be done with the accumulated rocks at the bottom of the waterfalls. They even contacted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for their opinion on the matter.                                                                                                    \n\nNobody could come up with a solution for the accumulated rocks, so they decided to shut down the falls. In the summer of 1969, over 1,000 trucks carried rocks and Earth to the falls just to get them to stop flowing. The loads were dumped upstream of the waterfall for three days. A cofferdam was created, and the falls stopped flowing. The water was redirected from there to the Horseshoe Falls.\n\nThe locals were very worried for two reasons. First, they knew that you couldn't control water. What would happen if the water was rerouted the wrong way, causing a significant flood? Also, they were worried about the tourists. What would happen if they failed to get the falls flowing again? Many locals made money from the tourists. If the falls stopped, the money would dry up as well. The tourists did stop visiting the falls that summer, but those who did show up got to see something that nobody will ever see again. They also had the opportunity to take rocks and incredible coins from the riverbed.\n\nThe people who watched while the waters of the fall over the falls when it drained saw skeletons in the water. It was unclear whether the skeletons belonged to animals who had drowned or people who had fallen in the falls at one point. When one of the skeletons was examined, it was determined that the man died when he jumped into the falls. The year that he died was unknown. Another skeleton was a woman, and there was no apparent cause of death apart from drowning. It is believed that the woman saw her loved one drown, and decided to meet him in the same spot.                                                                                                                                          \n\nThe fact that the experts were able to stop the falls from flowing was incredible. Fortunately, the falls started flowing again, and today, the Niagara Falls are as incredible as ever.

From big companies to new startups, several automakers are rushing headlong to promise more electric cars models ranging from electric cars to electric pickups to make sure that everyone can choose. Here are the top 11 new electric cars coming in 2022.\n\n11. AUDI A6 E-TRON \nThe A6 E-Tron was unveiled at Auto Shanghai this year, and it is expected to be available by late 2022. Audi revealed that the A6 E-Tron would be the first vehicle built on a new modular electric platform that Audi developed together with Porsche. Also called the Premium Platform Electric architecture, the modular electric platform can be lengthened, lifted, and widened for various electric vehicle models. \n\n10. BMW iX \nThis BMW's new flagship electric SUV will arrive in early 2022 with luxury trim and advanced technology that showcase the automaker\u2019s latest technology. The iX is not like any car we have seen before; it has a polarizing new BMW look with its massive grille, floating touchscreen, and squared-off steering wheel. \n\n9. CADILLAC LYRIQ \nCadillac is months away from becoming an electric vehicle brand with its Lyriq that will be available in early 2022. The automaker says that the Lyriq will be built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, alongside other General Motor electric vehicles. \n\n8. FORD F-150 LIGHTNING\nThe F-150 pickup truck of the Ford F-series has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States for nearly 40 years, and Ford decided to honor it with electrification.  The F-150 Lightning, which will go on sale in spring 2022, will be offered in two power configurations, the 426 horsepower, and 563 horsepower, and Ford claims its 563-hp dual-motor truck can get to 60 mph in the mid-4.0 second range.  \n\n7. MERCEDES-BENZ EQA \nMercedes-Benz's new electric lineup is referred to as the EQ family. The EQA is the company's smallest electric compact SUV, revealed earlier this year in the Europe-spec form. \n\n6. MERCEDES BENZ EQB \nThe EQB, with its exquisite styling cues and lighting accents, is based on the GLB-class SUV. The electric vehicle will launch first in China and later in other parts of the world. According to the automaker, the EQB will have up to seven seats, plus an optional third row, but the EQB's size is better suited for two rows.\n\n5. Rivian R1S \nThe startup automaker, Rivian, isn't just making an electric truck\u2014the RT1 that will be available later this year, it's also making an electric SUV\u2014the R1S that will be available in early 2022. \n\n4. TESLA CYBERTRUCK PICKUP \nTesla\u2019s lifestyle pickup is expected to retain the wild, \u2018Blade Runner\u2019-inspired trapezoidal styling and stainless-steel body of the concept introduced in 2019. With its polarizing design, Tesla says the crew-cab truck will come in early 2022 in three variations. \n\n3. TESLA ROADSTER SPORTS CAR \nTesla announced the successor to its original Roadster in 2017, and the supercar specs were jaw-dropping. From its 200-kilowatt battery, and with the help of a thruster, the new Roadster gives a 0 to 60 mph time of 1.9 seconds.\n\n2. Toyota bZ4X Concept \nToyota promised a fleet of new electric vehicles sometime before 2025, seven of which will use the bZ model name. The bZ4X is the first electric vehicle to rolls off the Toyota bZ line, and it's a perk into what Toyota\u2019s electric future looks like. This compact SUV it's pretty much like the Toyota RAV4 electric vehicle, but the automaker hasn't hinted at the range or charging speed. However, they did tell us it will use the e-TNGA platform created through Toyota's partnership with Subaru. \n\n1.VOLKSWAGEN I.D. SPACE VIZZION \nThis Volkswagen concept vehicle made its debut at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show. Compact yet spacious enough, the Volkswagen ID Space Vizzion Luxury car has set the bar higher for concepts cars. Every aspect of its expressive silhouette has been designed with the electrifying performance of the ID Space Vizzion in mind. Its aerodynamic shape is particularly impressive, enabling a drag coefficient of 0.24 and a range of up to 300 miles.", "date": "Nov 2, 2021", "views": "541,431 views", "comments": "399", "likes": "3,388 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 575.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BasO1xLVlw", "id": "5BasO1xLVlw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evSBfCGUfqw": {"title": "What does German Shepherd do when I hug a puppy", "content creator": "Rocky", "description": "What does German Shepherd do when I hug a puppy!
