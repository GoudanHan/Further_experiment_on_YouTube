In this video I restored an old Zippo lighter and made a case for this Zippo, out of wood and Epoxy resin.\nThis zippo lighter is quite old. I bought it for restoration from a person who found it with the metal detector on a beach. This zippo is made of brass and the sea water created a beautiful patina but if I had not restored it now, it would most likely have been destroyed in a short time. \n\nThe restoration of the zippo lighter was not difficult because I used original parts for repair. But after I finished restoring I thought of making a wooden and Epoxy resin case. I have never seen this project anywhere so I had to make my own plan. For the case I used curly Koa wood. I will leave you a link at the end of the description. It was quite difficult to mill the slot where the lighter had to go.\n\nI tried in this restoration process to film the steps that I followed quite simply to understand by you, but if you have questions about the restoration, I am at your disposal in the comments category.\n\nAlso, during the restoration I used subtitles about the process and solutions used. If you notice grammatical errors, I apologize in advance. English is not my native language and I am doing my best to improve it.\n\nI put a lot of passion and effort into this restoration. Although I was afraid of the results of the case, I am proud of how it came out and I really like it. I hope you like the restoration and the construction of that case.\nThat's all for this project, enjoy watching and I have to focus for the next restoration. \nThe following link belongs to the person from whom I got the wood.
