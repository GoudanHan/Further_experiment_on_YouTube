But there are many theories, which may help to shed light on this mystery of the oceanic deep.\n\nA brilliant example to show that deep sea fauna does indeed follow this rule, is the mollusk group, gastropods, which includes slugs and snails. In the deep, many species that are near symmetrical to shallower varieties, grow to be huge. The deep sea isopod belongs to a group that rarely grows larger than a few inches in the shadows, but down here they can grow to half a metre in length, and weigh approximately 1.7 kilograms. This variety, the giant isopod, is found in the deep, cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.", "date": "Oct 6, 2020", "views": "4,298,495 views", "comments": "5,344", "likes": "142,649 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 490.281, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwwBHgl5zJo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTXVKvxh3DA": {"title": "The Last of Us 2 PS5 Aggressive Grounded Gameplay (Hospital Infiltration) | 60FPS .", "content creator": "GamerANH", "description": "Don't forget to\"Subscribe\" & activate the \"notification bell\" .\nThe Last of Us Part 2 | PS5 Gameplay\nDifficulty : ( Grounded+ / NO damage )\nLook Sensitivity : 6   -----   Aiming Sensitivity : 8", "date": "Jul 6, 2021", "views": "381,616 views", "comments": "411", "likes": "6,680 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 755.181, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTXVKvxh3DA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6eBKvph_Y": {"title": "The Secret History of MK Ultra w/Tom O'Neill | Joe Rogan", "content creator": "JRE Clips", "description": "Taken from JRE #1459 w/Tom O'Neill: \nhttps://youtu.be/J36xPWBLcG8", "date": "Apr 16, 2020", "views": "970,078 views", "comments": "2,326", "likes": "18,901 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1242.141, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6eBKvph_Y"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re1lEVCur1o": {"title": "Nestle Crunch", "content creator": "kmlkmljkl", "description": "yum\n\n1980s Nestle Crunch Commercial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcJAh...", "date": "Feb 8, 2018", "views": "27,225,221 views", "comments": "11,488", "likes": "530,527 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 8.721, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re1lEVCur1o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tsdOo_wO44": {"title": "Well, I didn\u2019t like Joker", "content creator": "Jenny Nicholson", "description": "Don\u2019t worry I promise my next video will be about something way more topical and interesting like A Dog's Purpose or Halloween spider decorations!\n\nWays in which Joker (2019) is the same as Mamma Mia!
