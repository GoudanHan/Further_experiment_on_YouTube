The communist government of North Vietnam went against South Vietnam, who were aided by the United States. This war cost the lives of millions, most of the dead being Vietnamese civilians. However, despite the strong military of the US... they lost. The Vietnamese had better tactics, they knew the terrain, and the morale of US soldiers was very low. Not everyone believed in this war. Then, the media got involved, travelling to the site of the war and exposing the atrocities that took place. Citizens of the US were divided, with many of them opposing the war. Finally, in 1973, the U.S forces withdrew from Vietnam. The communist forces seized control, and the country became the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n\nYOUTUBE PRODUCERS:\n- BlueDiamondBelle\n- MEME MACHINE\n- PVT Wohlenhaus\n- ShockTriC\n- L\u00f6wenkrieger\n- Jearbear Gaming\n- JabberTheRapper", "date": "Premiered Dec 21, 2021", "views": "1,540,394 views", "comments": "3,657", "likes": "107,176 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 53.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6wpsfYuUPk", "id": "Y6wpsfYuUPk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgJMaP4msTs": {"title": "Ragnar Lodbrok vs Richard The Lionheart.

Here, he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from jungle-warfare movies and rates them based on their accuracy. \n\nMason reviews classic Hollywood movies such as \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), \"Platoon\" (1986), \"Tears of the Sun\" (2003), \"Forrest Gump\" (1994), and \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002). He also rates the realism of the HBO miniseries \"The Pacific\" (2010).How reasonable are the jungle tactics in \"Predator\" (1987)? Does Christian Bale use the correct method for jungle helicopter rescue in \"Rescue Dawn\" (2006)? How realistic are the stealth and sniping tactics in \"Sniper\" (1993)? And would the camouflage Sylvester Stallone uses in \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" (1985) be successful? The Jungle Operations Training Course in Hawaii is a 12-day program for US Army regiments that covers mobility training, waterborne operations, combat tracking, jungle tactics, and survival training. Students learn tactics, techniques, and procedures required to fight, win, and survive. There are 10 courses a year for regular active-duty soldiers, Marines, sailors, and airmen, and menu-based training for Special Operations. Mason has been involved in the course since 2014 and became the senior instructor in 2018. \n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?
