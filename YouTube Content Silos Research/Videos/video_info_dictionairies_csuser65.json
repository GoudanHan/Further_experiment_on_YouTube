It's important for all of us. \n\n1. Identity Protection. Sometimes you just don't want anyone to know who you really are. Even if you aren't involved in anything illegal or questionable. There's a level of social safety that comes with anonymity. \n2. Personal Pressure. Online pressure can manifest in many ways: when someone releases your personal information, intimate photos or videos of you on the internet without your knowledge. At best, it's a violation of privacy. At worst, it can obliterate your reputation, your future, and even your sanity.\n3. Sensitive Issues. There's one other major category of people who benefit from anonymity: those who need more information on a given topic but don't want to be caught seeking out that information. Most people actually fall into this group without realizing it.\n\nWhether we're avoiding cybercriminals or dealing with a sensitive personal issue, we all benefit from being able to stay anonymous online.\n\nWe have created a new channel and we really need your help.\n \ud83d\ude4f Please like, comment or subscribe.\nGenre: Electronic music\nStyle: Downtempo, Chillstep, Future Garage\nMood: Inspiring, Smooth, Future, Cyber, Space, Dark\nDuration: 24/7\nFeature: Without Lyrics\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 Similar videos\nEnergy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nFuture Garage \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nMusic Genres \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAll Music VIdeos \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nWork Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillout Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nStudy Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nHacker Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nAmbient Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nChillstep Music \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n\n\n #MusicForCoding #ProgrammingPlaylist #MusicForConcentration", "date": "Started streaming on Jul 15, 2021", "views": "282 watching now", "comments": "Error found: Message: \n", "likes": "Unavailable", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 8243980.271000001, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_daTfgc4u3k", "id": "_daTfgc4u3k"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pJd6O_NT0": {"title": "Exclusive: Full Interview With Russian President Vladimir Putin", "content creator": "NBC News", "description": "In an NBC News worldwide exclusive, senior international correspondent Keir Simmons sits down with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for a one-on-one interview, just days ahead of a critical summit with President Biden.\n\u00bb Subscribe to NBC News: ", "date": "Jun 14, 2021", "views": "7,570,628 views", "comments": "41,784", "likes": "69,659 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4972.761, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pJd6O_NT0", "id": "m6pJd6O_NT0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpIG1eeb0Bo": {"title": "LaMarvelous Ball with the game winner!", "content creator": "MLG Highlights", "description": "#nba #nbahighlights #mlg", "date": "Jan 10, 2022", "views": "1,235,126 views", "comments": "1,664", "likes": "13,946 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 30.941, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpIG1eeb0Bo", "id": "gpIG1eeb0Bo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GldRtyEqPt8": {"title": "Reefer Madness: The Science of Marijuana with Neil deGrasse Tyson and Dr. Staci Gruber", "content creator": "StarTalk", "description": "Does weed make you faster? On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Gary O\u2019Reilly and Chuck Nice hash out the effects of cannabis with neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School and director of the MIND Program Dr. Staci Gruber. Is smoking dope really doping?\n\nWill smoking weed make you run faster? We break down if the science supports the decision to not let Sha\u2019carri Richarson compete in the Olympics after having tested positive for marijuana. What are the rules for banned substances? What gets a substance on the banned list? We explore medicinal and recreational uses of marijuana. How has use changed over the years? What does Schedule 1 mean? What\u2019s the difference between THC and CBD? \n\nWhat are the chemical differences between cannabis and drugs that are allowed? Why can you take an NSAID and not weed? Discover the effects of your mind on drugs. Is your brain really built for weed? What are the downstream effects of cannabis use? Find out how genetics impact your capability to process cannabinoids. We discuss cannabinoid receptors, alcohol dehydrogenase, and whether coffee use should be banned. Does cannabis help in sports where you need stability and precision? Should different drugs be banned for different sports? \n\nShould sports leagues change rules on weed? Should the country? How does research get conducted on a substance that is still illegal at the federal level? What are the rules regarding CBD? Why do they differ? How can legislation help lead science? As opinions change in the U.S., how do we approach rules in other countries in international competition? Is marijuana really a gateway drug? All that, plus, we make plans to replace the G20 Summit with the OG420 Summit.
