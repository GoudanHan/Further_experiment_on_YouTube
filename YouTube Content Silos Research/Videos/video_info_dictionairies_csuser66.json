As I am of course a huge fan of exploiting strategy games I took it upon myself to see if I could cheese the economy and the battle AI in 3 kingdoms total war. Today however I will be asking is total war three kingdoms a perfectly balanced game with no exploits. Or is it a game with exploits?? Who knows... well I do know that unlimited horses that have no maintenance as well as unlimited gold and armies might imbalance the game to a certain degree. Is that an exploit? Well alas this game break is going to be something special! \n\nWho even reads these anyways? I could probably just repeat The Spiffing Brit and Tea 40x and no one would notice ;) \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this total war Exploit! \n\n\nPatreon: ", "date": "Jul 11, 2019", "views": "1,359,412 views", "comments": "2,818", "likes": "47,271 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2023.681, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aXz_Lh1AVQ", "id": "1aXz_Lh1AVQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfKwDXCrDO8": {"title": "tell me gordon wont like your food without telling gordon wont like your food", "content creator": "Kitchen Nightmares", "description": "OUR FOOD IS GOOD\n\n#GordonRamsay #KitchenNightmares", "date": "Jul 7, 2021", "views": "5,415,308 views", "comments": "6,708", "likes": "104,892 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1080.061, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfKwDXCrDO8", "id": "wfKwDXCrDO8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyoxZWRbkxA": {"title": "US increased military presence on Guam", "content creator": "China Reports - The BL", "description": "The Pentagon stated in the recent evaluation on global resources that Guam is a strategic location and planned to upgrade its airbase and other capabilities.

This time, he's reviewing half of the fatalities in the game.\nDr. Wagner is here to let us know: is that skull model realistic? If a body were cut in half, how much intestine would we REALLY see? Did the Mortal Kombat creators really model every single bone in the spinal column? Find out just how deep this game's developers went in their research on human anatomy!\nThe 37 fatalities are performed on Nurse D'Vorah for monetization... so that blue blood is pretty normal.\nSee you in a few months for the second half of these fatalities!\n\n\nIn the Mortal Kombat series of fighting games, a Fatality is a special finishing move that can be used against one's opponent at the end of the final match. When the announcer says \"Finish Him\", or \"Finish Her\" if the opponent is female, the player can choose to kill him or her through a fatality move. If input correctly, the background will darken, followed by the desired result.\nIn the first game, the fatalities were pretty tamed, just a simple decapitation or ripping his heart off. But after 29 years, the Mortal Kombat developers have found so many varied and over-the-top ways to kill the characters that now, every single one of them is a true spectacle to behold.\n-------------------- \nCheck out Dr. Jordan Wagner on YouTube AND follow him on Instagram.\nDr. Jordan Wagner: ", "date": "Jun 17, 2021", "views": "8,753,108 views", "comments": "7,169", "likes": "155,678 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1439.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny_zTN_LeUA", "id": "ny_zTN_LeUA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8J9sC1yksM": {"title": "Sarah Palin calls out AOC's recent 'creepy' behavior", "content creator": "Fox News", "description": "Sarah Palin reacts to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accusing her critics of being sexually frustrated and says it's a detraction from the real issues on 'Fox News Primetime.' #FoxNews #FoxNewsPrimetime", "date": "Jan 10, 2022", "views": "937,292 views", "comments": "7,045", "likes": "29,894 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 311.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8J9sC1yksM", "id": "B8J9sC1yksM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QBDgwtO_Xk": {"title": "Ben Shapiro Leaves Liberal Professor SPEECHLESS In An Epic Debate", "content creator": "Crysta", "description": "visit www.famegist.com for 24 hours conservative news content", "date": "Feb 17, 2019", "views": "8,009,065 views", "comments": "14,520", "likes": "82,558 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 695.161, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QBDgwtO_Xk", "id": "_QBDgwtO_Xk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cebFWOlx848": {"title": "The Illusion of Truth", "content creator": "Veritasium", "description": "If you repeat something enough times, it comes to feel good and true.\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://bit.ly/VePatreon\nScience with Hot Wheels!
