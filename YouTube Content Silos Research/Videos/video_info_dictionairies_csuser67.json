Zerra also analyzes which survival tactics are accurate in \"The Office\" (2007), \"The Way Back\" (2010), \"The Hunted\" (2003), and \"The Mountain Between Us\" (2017).\n\nYou can follow Laura Zerra here: ", "date": "Jul 13, 2021", "views": "852,831 views", "comments": "1,295", "likes": "21,897 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1071.361, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQdVJh5PkI", "id": "fwQdVJh5PkI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-Cb9x70gYQ": {"title": "Amtrak Snow-mo Collision", "content creator": "Nick Colvin", "description": "Train moving faster than usual plus fresh snow from Stella resulted in a more spectacular arrival than expected.\n\n* Jukin Media Verified *\nFind this video and others like it by visiting ", "date": "Mar 15, 2017", "views": "33,502,639 views", "comments": "19,779", "likes": "322,286 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 42.481, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-Cb9x70gYQ", "id": "V-Cb9x70gYQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrmN8s83RO4": {"title": "Actually Trying the Worst Self Defense Advice", "content creator": "penguinz0", "description": "This is the greatest self defense training of All Time\nI stream every day https://www.twitch.tv/moistcr1tikal", "date": "Dec 16, 2021", "views": "4,556,379 views", "comments": "8,482", "likes": "243,250 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 710.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrmN8s83RO4", "id": "LrmN8s83RO4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EH_cKkLhhY": {"title": "Biden heckled by protesters yelling \u2018resign you tyrant!\u2019 on tour of Ida damage in New Jersey", "content creator": "The Sun", "description": "PRESIDENT Biden was branded a \u201ctyrant\u201d and told to \u201cresign\u201d by New Jersey locals furious over the Afghanistan crisis as he toured of areas left wrecked by Hurricane Ida on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the Commander-in-Chief was shaking hands with locals and first responders along some residential streets in Manville, some spectators teed off over the president\u2019s hasty order to pull US troops from Afghanistan by Aug. 31.\n\n\u201cResign, you tyrant,\u201d one person could be heard shouting at Biden.\n\n\"All this for a f***ing photo-op?\" one man erupted, according to CSPAN's footage.\n\n\"You ain't gonna do s***!\"\n\nIda pelted the Garden State and Mid-Atlantic region with unending flash floods, tornadoes and severe damage to infrastructure and homes.\n\nA spectator held a handmade sign with Biden's hands dripping in blood that read: \"HURRICANE BIDEN: MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN IDA!\n\nOne man let Biden know that he was personally affronted by the bloodletting at Hamid Karzai International Airport that also took the lives of nearly 100 Afghan civilians. \n\n\u201cMy best friend died in 2011 in Afghanistan for what?\" a man shouted. \n\n\"For this guy to pull this s***? \n\n\u201cYou leave them in ruins and leave Americans behind!\u201d\n\nContinue reading\nBiden heckled by protesters yelling \u2018resign you tyrant!\u2019 on tour of Ida damage in New Jersey", "date": "Sep 8, 2021", "views": "1,712,105 views", "comments": "9,564", "likes": "49,332 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 84.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EH_cKkLhhY", "id": "9EH_cKkLhhY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4SYIfhzMmU": {"title": "Dave Chappelle Describes His First Encounter with Kanye West", "content creator": "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", "description": "Jimmy talks to Dave about his return to New York for a nine show run at Radio City Music Hall and where he first met his old pals The Roots and Kanye West.\n\nSubscribe NOW to The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: ", "date": "Jun 14, 2014", "views": "34,865,635 views", "comments": "10,470", "likes": "196,817 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 390.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4SYIfhzMmU", "id": "R4SYIfhzMmU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feGHmv_eDcw": {"title": "Disease Expert Breaks Down Pandemic Scenes From Film & TV | WIRED", "content creator": "WIRED", "description": "Brian Amman, ecologist for the Centers for Disease Control, takes a look at disastrous pandemics from a variety of television shows and movies and breaks down how accurate their depictions really are.

Brian Greene is an excellent science communicator and he makes complex cosmological concepts more easy to understand. \n\nThe Big Bang explains the evolution of the universe from a starting density and temperature that is currently well beyond humanity's capability to replicate. Thus the most extreme conditions and earliest times of the universe are speculative and any explanation for what caused the big bang should be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless that shouldn't stop us to ask questions like what was there before the big bang.\n\nBrian Greene mentions the possibility that time itself may have originated with the birth of the cosmos about 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nTo understand how the Universe came to be, scientists combine mathematical models with observations and develop workable theories which explain the evolution of the cosmos. The Big Bang theory, which is built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a singularity at the origin of cosmic time. \n\nHowever, the physical theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics as currently realized are not applicable before the Planck epoch, which is the earliest period of time in the history of the universe, and correcting this will require the development of a correct treatment of quantum gravity.\n\nCertain quantum gravity treatments imply that time itself could be an emergent property. Which leads some physicists to conclude that time did not exist before the Big Bang. While others are open to the possibility of time preceding the big bang.\n\nOne of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is that it fully explains the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not describe how energy, time, and space were caused, but rather it describes the emergence of the present universe from an ultra-dense and high-temperature initial state. It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.", "date": "Jun 12, 2021", "views": "1,237,001 views", "comments": "4,821", "likes": "25,685 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 606.361, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXixKGcctms", "id": "PXixKGcctms"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBL93fZXgQk": {"title": "Christian Apologist Impersonates an Atheist, Atheists Respond", "content creator": "Genetically Modified Skeptic", "description": "Apologist Sean McDowell posed as an atheist to teach Christian students how to debate atheists.

He then held a Q&A where he discussed the multiverse and fine-tuning, biblical prophecy, consciousness and many other subjects related to theology and apologetics. The discourse between Christians and atheists is already strained, and while I think Sean wants to improve that discourse, acts like these are not the way.

An initial focus on this 6th generation air superiority roles has moved away from close-in dogfighting, which is becoming less common, and instead broadened to embrace ground support, cyber warfare and even space warfare capabilities, with beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile capability remaining important.\nTypical design characteristics anticipated to deliver these roles include:\n\u2022 Advanced digital capabilities including high-capacity networking, AI, data fusion, cyber warfare, D2D and battlefield command, control and communications (C3) capabilities.\n\u2022 Optionally manned, with the same airframe capable of conducting piloted, remote controlled or onboard-AI controlled missions.\n\u2022 Enhanced human-systems integration, with virtual cockpits presented via helmet-mounted displays which allow the pilot 360-degree vision with AI-enhanced battlefield awareness, and replacing conventional instrument panels.\n\u2022 Advanced stealth airframes and avionics.\n\u2022 Advanced variable-cycle engines able to cruise economically but still deliver high thrust when required.\n\u2022 Increased-range stand off and BVR weapons.\n\u2022 Potential use of directed-energy weapons such as a laser CIWS.\n\nEnjoy watching.
