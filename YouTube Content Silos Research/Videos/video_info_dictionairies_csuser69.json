Tattletail Kaleidoscope Gameplay is much scarier and focuses on more lore.\n\nFor the 5 nights leading up to Christmas, the player must tend to their Baby Talking Tattletail toy by feeding it, grooming it, and allowing it to charge while completing a set of objectives each night. While the Baby Tattletail is not a threat, it is prone to generating a lot of sound when its 3 needs are not met, alerting Mama Tattletail of their location. While completing a set task, the player must avoid Mama by staying quiet when she is near. Failure to do so, or going too close, will result in Mama attacking the player in a jumpscare.\n\nPlayers acquire a shake, glow-in-the-dark flashlight to navigate in the darkness, but Mama Tattletail has the ability to \"kill\" their flashlight when they point it directly at her. Baby Tattletail is also afraid of the dark and is quite vocal about it, creating a necessity to recharge the flashlight by shaking it quickly. However, shaking it generates sound, so the player must be careful about when and where to shake.\n\nOver the course of the game, a series of various \"Gift Eggs,\" presumably laid by the Tattletail's, are placed throughout the house. Collecting all of the eggs will result in the player achieving the \"good ending\" of the game.\n\nDo you guys like Tattletail? Or better question, why are you reading this?\n\nTattletail in my opinion is one of my favorite games of all time, it shared space with horror games like hello neighbor , bendy and the ink machine , granny , granny 2 , and many many more classic video games during this time.\n\nThe game takes place in 1998 over the course of 5 nights, beginning on December 20 and ending on Christmas Day. The player wakes up on Night 1 to open their Christmas present early. The present is the new fad toy, a purple Baby Talking Tattletail (based on a Furby). After playing with the toy briefly (which involves feeding and grooming it), the player puts it back into its box and goes back to bed.\n\nOn Night 2, the player finds the same Tattletail in the tumble dryer, with no indication of how it got there. The player then charges it, wraps it back up into its box and goes back to bed.\n\nOn Night 3, the player encounters the contents of an old nursery in the basement. In the corner sits the now-recalled Mama Tattletail, along with a cassette tape which can be played using the toy. The tape contains a snippet from a story in a read-along style - including prompts to \"turn the page\" - about how \"the children thought that Mama would never find them as long as she couldn't see them\" but Mama would find them nevertheless. The player returns upstairs to find that Tattletail has made a mess. Tattletail asks to be taken to \u201cMama\u201d. The player returns to the spot to find that Mama has disappeared. Mama Tattletail then starts to hunt down the player when they try to clean up after Tattletail.\n\nOn Night 4, after a lengthy hide-and-seek session with another Tattletail, the player finds a VHS tape that shows several camera feeds from what seems to be a Tattletail commercial (which is actually footage from the trailer).\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Baby Talking Tattletail invites the player to the basement to join a \"party\" with a yellow and blue Baby Talking Tattletail, with two more that the player must fetch. After the player gets them, they must pick up their own Tattletail and get some supplies from upstairs. The player then finds out that the Talking Tattletails have made a pentagram out of the Christmas lights with the VHS tape in the middle, and have begun chanting in a seance. After rewinding the VHS tape, Mama appears and steals the candles and the player must find them in vases scattered around the basement while avoiding being attacked by Mama.", "date": "May 5, 2021", "views": "526,662 views", "comments": "1,974", "likes": "26,347 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 814.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzwqsoXS44", "id": "5JzwqsoXS44"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTr7seYKy-A": {"title": "What if you hide stay in daycare until 6AM? - Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach", "content creator": "Banden", "description": "What happens if you decide to stay and hide inside the daycare with Sun until 6AM?

Even if he won't be joining us in Arcane Season 2, I think Silco will always be remembered.\n\nEven if Vander was a better father\u2026\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: ", "date": "Dec 24, 2021", "views": "6,441 views", "comments": "47", "likes": "619 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 502.281, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEBqe4jBkKY", "id": "PEBqe4jBkKY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LMwgWFzDjU": {"title": "Men I Trust - Tree Among Shrubs", "content creator": "Men I Trust", "description": "Shot on 8mm film in Quebec City and during our Untourable Tour 2021, in the USA.\n\nProcessing: Eastman Kodak NY\nScan & grading: Metropolis Post NY\n\nStream Untourable Album: ", "date": "Nov 15, 2021", "views": "536,904 views", "comments": "909", "likes": "30,627 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 187.481, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LMwgWFzDjU", "id": "0LMwgWFzDjU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapflnWC0aA": {"title": "Loyalty and leadership in Arcane | An Arcane video essay", "content creator": "JP Writes", "description": "In Act 3 of Arcane, there's an arc where Silco might lose his position of leadership in the undercity. The Chem Barons are dissatisfied with the way he is running things, and Finn wants to oust him.\n\nHe approaches Sevika about joining him as an ally, and this leads to a scene where Sevika, Finn and Silco are all around Silco's desk, and it's not clear whose side Sevika is on as she draws her knife.\n\nThen Silco starts talking about loyalty, and this struck be as odd, because we've seen that Sevika isn't the most loyal person - she sided with Silco against Vander in Act 1. It got me thinking - what were the differences between Vander and Silco, that led to Sevika being loyal to one and not the other?\n\nFIND ME ONLINE:\nInstagram: ", "date": "Jan 5, 2022", "views": "17,122 views", "comments": "164", "likes": "1,472 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 675.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapflnWC0aA", "id": "hapflnWC0aA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzsOvzwc2zM": {"title": "Andrew Garfield being good on DR UK", "content creator": "Mandeluxe", "description": "", "date": "Oct 6, 2019", "views": "626,831 views", "comments": "648", "likes": "34,488 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 162.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzsOvzwc2zM", "id": "BzsOvzwc2zM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqPY1h8udRg": {"title": "The part in the ratatouille movie where the bread makes a crunchy sound.", "content creator": "GandhiGuru503", "description": "This is a meme that is funny because usually when bread is woman-handled like you see in the video above, it doesnt make a sound that is as loud as it was in the video that is above subscribe for more memes based around the movie ratatouille for more videos just like it thanks.", "date": "Sep 20, 2019", "views": "1,384,746 views", "comments": "1,284", "likes": "92,712 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 12.201, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqPY1h8udRg", "id": "sqPY1h8udRg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1afqR5QkDM": {"title": "The Aesthetic | ContraPoints", "content creator": "ContraPoints", "description": "What matters more\u2014the way things are or the way things look?\nSupport this channel: https://www.patreon.com/contrapoints", "date": "Sep 19, 2018", "views": "1,564,054 views", "comments": "7,962", "likes": "68,484 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1282.721, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1afqR5QkDM", "id": "z1afqR5QkDM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK8KqAxhEZo": {"title": "Vaush responds to Professor flowers", "content creator": "Man5aMu5a", "description": "this man literally responded to a video about him 4 hours after it was uploaded\n\n\nProfessor flowers video", "date": "Aug 20, 2021", "views": "1,991 views", "comments": "51", "likes": "12 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 7110.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK8KqAxhEZo", "id": "oK8KqAxhEZo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4rhLfCPwLU": {"title": "What happens if Gregory shoots Vanessa with Laser Gun - FNAF Security Breach", "content creator": "Rubhen925", "description": "Five Nights at Freddys: Security Breach - What happens if Gregory shoots Vanessa with Laser Gun | Unused Stun Animation - FNAF Security Breach PC PS5 PS4 (2021)\n#FiveNightsAtFreddysSecurityBreach #FiveNightsAtFreddys #FNAF #Rubhen925 #Gameplay ", "date": "Dec 24, 2021", "views": "3,167,422 views", "comments": "1,846", "likes": "64,199 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 49.241, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4rhLfCPwLU", "id": "L4rhLfCPwLU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GErIPKjwuDg": {"title": "Oh no!
