Some companies develop highly profitable drugs with public money, while others have been found to have covered up serious side effects.\n\nThe fight against Covid-19 is further fueling the greed of pharmaceutical companies. Does the industry\u2019s influence threaten public health systems? \n\nThe industry has seen major changes in the last decade. Most of the world\u2019s pharmaceuticals are produced by a handful of large corporations, so-called Big Pharma. They\u2019re richer and more powerful than ever. In some cases, they can even call the shots on governmental health policies. \n\nThis documentary is the result of more than a year of research, and brings together patients, whistleblowers, lawyers, doctors and politicians, as well as representatives of the industry. Large laboratories are accused of concealing or downplaying research results to maintain their monopolies. Take the manufacturer Sanofi, whose epilepsy drug Depakine triggered a scandal throughout Europe. In the US, Johnson & Johnson has had to stand trial for driving millions of people into opioid addiction. And Novartis is one of several companies now facing huge fines over improper practices in the treatment of macular degeneration, an eye disease.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry gets support from influential doctors. But only one-fifth of German doctors declare what they receive from drug companies. As the world battles the Coronavirus pandemic, this documentary also looks at the lobbying efforts of manufacturer Gilead, as it seeks approval for a promising drug developed largely with public money.

When the journalists arrive, locals were busy preparing for upcoming Chinese New Year celebration. At the time, not much was known about the virus that was just days away from changing the world. Then came a pivotal announcement: human-to-human transmission was confirmed. The journalists witnessed a city of 11 million people transform overnight. Initial nonchalance was quickly replaced by panic. People started wearing masks, shops were shuttered. They shuttled between the increasingly saturated hospitals and Huanan Seafood Market, at the time thought to be the epicentre of this contagion. And they were stopped at every juncture.

And that\u2019s why they run great risks every day in pursuit of it. \n\nAll this is more than just a walk to school \u2013 It is a test in the vast jungle. Throughout this journey they all have only one goal in mind: to ultimately find a job in a city and lead a better life.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: ", "date": "Jul 23, 2019", "views": "4,498,502 views", "comments": "7,013", "likes": "49,603 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2880, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGRnd8WlcIU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySLuQHzeyO0&list=RDCMUCijcd0GR0fkxCAZwkiuWqtQ&start_radio=1&rv=ySLuQHzeyO0": {"title": "Deadliest Roads | Nicaragua: In the Name of the Law | Free Documentary", "content creator": "Free Documentary", "description": "World's Most Dangerous Roads: Deadliest Journeys in Nicaragua (2018)\n\nDeadliest Roads - Congo: Jungle Messengers: https://youtu.be/coyaVoVkhVw", "date": "Jan 16, 2022", "views": "199,399 views", "comments": "384", "likes": "3,516 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2976.261, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySLuQHzeyO0&list=RDCMUCijcd0GR0fkxCAZwkiuWqtQ&start_radio=1&rv=ySLuQHzeyO0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoAlAYJzONo": {"title": "Extremely Heavy Mining Truck | Mega Transports | Free Documentary", "content creator": "Free Documentary", "description": "Mega Transports: Mining Truck | Engineering Documentary\nHow can a dump truck too heavy for the roads be transported?\n\nIf a transporter needs to be transported, if 176 wheels aren\u2019t enough to carry its weight and if the load weighs twice as much as the transporter\u2026 Then it must be the mother of all mega transports! The setting: Canada. The cargo: an ultra-class dump truck. The heroes: tough men with delicate fingers and eagle eyes.\n\nIn the midst of the no-man\u2019s-land of Fort McKay, in the province of Alberta, the multi-national company Mammoet has built up a business for special transports. For there is treasure in this region: natural gas. To extract it, heavy machines are necessary. Heavy Machines like the 797. The biggest dump truck Cat has ever built \u2013 THE work horse of the North American mining industry. The record-breaking size of its wheels is matched only by that of its price: six to eight million dollars. This is the very truck that Mammoet is supposed to deliver today to its operation site, an oil sands surface mine. \n\nAlthough the mine is only 7 kilometres away, the truck does not manage the short distance on its own power. With the truck\u2019s 300 tons distributed over only four wheels, the road would not be able to withstand the weight. Like an elephant standing on four juice-boxes. The pressure on the four small patches of ground would immediately burst the asphalt. So, it has to be transported on a special trailer, which has to be precisely assembled before the loading can start. And: the transport has to be finished before rush-hour\u2026\n\nThis mega transport requires everything from man and machine. \n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: ", "date": "Jan 24, 2020", "views": "3,694,198 views", "comments": "599", "likes": "21,397 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2929.561, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoAlAYJzONo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SVPsGMPi8&list=RDLVn-SVPsGMPi8&start_radio=1&rv=n-SVPsGMPi8": {"title": "", "content creator": "PhilosophyInsights", "description": "", "date": "", "views": "", "comments": "1,246", "likes": "36,424 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 621.081, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SVPsGMPi8&list=RDLVn-SVPsGMPi8&start_radio=1&rv=n-SVPsGMPi8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-FxUhbJ-Ow": {"title": "Jordan Peterson: Crucial relationship guidance", "content creator": "Essential Truth", "description": "Jordan Peterson talks in this video about very important information about relationships and conflict resolution.

Between 1937 and 1947 over 20,000 of them were built and in those 10 years, Spitfires changed dramatically from the Mk 1 to the Mk 24. More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world.

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"", "date": "Sep 4, 2009", "views": "18,502,718 views", "comments": "13,468", "likes": "236,998 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3296.001, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_zjdmkou0Q": {"title": "", "content creator": "Jordan B Peterson", "description": "", "date": "", "views": "", "comments": "2,721", "likes": "29,414 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6073.161, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_zjdmkou0Q"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4imQ63r_AvE": {"title": "Dana White asked \"Are you a Doctor?\" by reporter as COVID debate breaks out", "content creator": "TheMacLife", "description": "While one size does not fit all, one gift does!

He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain.\n \nSir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didn\u2019t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics.\n \nRobinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the \u201cindigenous working classes\u201d who made their voices known through their votes.\n \nAbout the Guest: Sir Roger Scruton\nSir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his \u201cservices to philosophy, teaching and public education.\u201d\n \n \nAdditional Resources:\n \nBrexit:", "date": "Jul 19, 2017", "views": "1,214,718 views", "comments": "694", "likes": "25,062 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2685.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eD9RDTl6tM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iRvEPcQV3I": {"title": "The History Of Socialism And Capitalism", "content creator": "Hoover Institution", "description": "Thursday, October 1, 2020\nHoover Institution\n\nThe Hoover Institution presents an online virtual speaker series based on the scholarly research and commentary written by Hoover fellows participating in the Human Prosperity Project on Socialism and Free-Market Capitalism.

Remember, ADHD has nothing to do with how smart a person is.\n\nClick here to subscribe to UNDERSTOOD: ", "date": "May 4, 2016", "views": "6,015,493 views", "comments": "22,459", "likes": "164,383 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1694, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouZrZa5pLXk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPaZlItAR8": {"title": "Wood rewarded for hostile Hobart spell with six wickets | Men's Ashes 2021-22", "content creator": "cricket.com.au", "description": "Vodafone Milestone: England's Mark Wood unsettled Australia's batting line-up at Blundstone Arena with some fast, hostile bowling that netted him a six-wicket haul.\n\nDownload our app: ", "date": "Jan 16, 2022", "views": "1,187,158 views", "comments": "467", "likes": "22,590 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 135.121, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPaZlItAR8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq3C9R8HNUQ": {"title": "ALOK: The Urgent Need for Compassion | The Man Enough Podcast", "content creator": "We Are Man Enough", "description": "In a conversation filled with wisdom, historical insight, and radical mercy, ALOK talks openly about their story, their movement to #DeGenderFashion, and they challenge us to get to know who we are outside of who we have been told we should be.

Charged with selling two illegal sawed-off shotguns to an undercover agent, Weaver had failed to appear in court and law enforcement was tasked with bringing him in. For months, the Weavers had been holed up on their property with a cache of firearms, including automatic weapons. When the federal agents surveilling the property crossed paths with members of the family, a firefight broke out. The standoff that mesmerized the nation would leave Weaver injured, his wife and son dead, and some convinced that the federal government was out of control. Drawing upon eyewitness accounts, including interviews with Weaver's daughter, Sara, and federal agents involved in the confrontation, Ruby Ridge is a riveting account of the event that helped give rise to the modern American militia movement.\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

Fry was joined on stage at the Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall by Richard Dawkins and the two discussed Hitch's unflinching commitment to the truth. \n\nHollywood actor Sean Penn was beamed in from LA by Google+ and, between cigarette puffs, read from Hitch's acclaimed work, The Trial of Henry Kissinger. Five friends of Hitch spoke via satellite in New York: satirist Christopher Buckley and editor Lewis Lapham mused on Hitch's prowess as a journalist. 'Like a pot of gold', said Lapham. Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie and James Fenton delighted the audience with stories of Hitchens as a young man.

I was hosted by Gunnlaugur Jonsson, who also introduced both talks.\n\nI've been using the lectures as an opportunity to extend, develop and publicly test the ideas I presented in 12 Rules and Maps of Meaning.\n\nMy wife Tammy and I had a remarkable and memorable trip to Iceland. My mother and aunt also came for the adventure, and were treated with exceptional care by Gunnlaugur and his crew. We are looking forward to returning to Iceland in 2019,\n\nThank you very much to Halld\u00f3r Fannar Kristj\u00e1nsson (Sigurgeirsson) for the video recording and editing. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: ", "date": "Aug 5, 2018", "views": "711,716 views", "comments": "1,262", "likes": "14,160 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 9612.761, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_QPCxCkws"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIEKfr9CaZA": {"title": "The Secret To Becoming Mentally Strong - Jordan Peterson Motivation", "content creator": "SUCCESS CHASERS", "description": "Jordan Peterson's Audiobook available for free here - https://amzn.to/2zpqHt2\nYou Can Pre-Order Jordan Peterson's New Book \"Beyond Order\" - https://amzn.to/33hUJLR\nThe Secret To Becoming Mentally Strong - Jordan Peterson Motivation\n\n===================================================\n\nSpeaker: Jordan Peterson", "date": "Mar 25, 2021", "views": "1,712,623 views", "comments": "1,139", "likes": "34,645 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3238, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIEKfr9CaZA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7ZXUUlMZ1o": {"title": "Biden is not making progress on inflation: Laffer", "content creator": "Fox Business", "description": "Former Reagan economic adviser Art Laffer reacts to Biden's claims of making progress on reducing inflation. #FOXBusiness #FoxBusinessTonight", "date": "Jan 12, 2022", "views": "30,722 views", "comments": "241", "likes": "954 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 391.341, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7ZXUUlMZ1o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iAjueE9Me0": {"title": "Kudlow: Midterms will kill the Build Back Better plan", "content creator": "Fox Business", "description": "\u2018Kudlow\u2019 discusses the future of Biden\u2019s spending agenda as it struggles to meet Christmas deadline.\n...\nKUDLOW:\nJoe Manchin has been indomitable, unyielding, and very much in tune with the American public.

Terry Radford from Just BioFiber says that these hempcrete blocks will sequester about 10 tons of carbon per house. \n\nJust BioFiber is located in Alberta, Canada and you can find out more about their hempcrete blocks here:", "date": "Nov 22, 2021", "views": "911,225 views", "comments": "2,477", "likes": "41,329 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 541.941, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLXXjvQXgI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vs2tdR-9C8": {"title": "The ZR-1 was too expensive to succeed \u2014 but too good to ignore | Jason Cammisa Revelations | Ep. 16", "content creator": "Hagerty", "description": "One of the design briefs for the C4 Corvette was that it had a minimal frontal cross-section, so it was less visible to radar. In other words, it helped you get away with speeding.\n\nAnother target was to be the most powerful car sold in America. The 1990 - 1995 Corvette's ZR-1 option package was the most expensive in the history of Detroit, but it gave the Corvette world-beater firepower.\n\nIts LT5 V-8 was designed by Lotus and built by Mercury Marine, an all-aluminum, four-cam V-8 that was developed from the Lotus Etna concept engine, not a Small Block. It shared the traditional Small Block 4.40-inch bore spacing (after a quick redesign) and used an early form of passive Variable Valve Timing.\n\nThe 32-valve V-8 breathed through 16 individual intake runners, half of which could be closed off at low loads. When opened, those runners breathed through valves that ran on a far more aggressive cam profile. This allowed the engine to be both torquey and efficient at low-rpms, but powerful at the top.\n\nThe 2023 Corvette Z06 is the first DOHC V-8 in a Corvette, but the ZR-1 was the only ever installed in the front. \n\nAnd through the ZR-1 broke records, it wasn't the sales success that Chevrolet had hoped for \u2014 and there are many very interesting reasons why - culminating in the grudge-match development of the LS-series Small Block.\n\nHost Jason Cammisa takes us through the story in this episode of Revelations.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day!

He had a lot of words for 31-year-old Camia Gamet, the woman convicted of killing her boyfriend Marcel Hill in March.

Still, while family members spoke she would only roll her eyes and laugh, but Jackson County Circuit Court Judge John McBain would have none of it.\n\n\"You're gonna shut your mouth or I'm going to have some duct tape put on it,\" said Judge McBain.\n\nA jury convicted Gamet for stabbing and beating to death Hill. Her lawyer argued she acted in self defense, because she claimed she killed an unknown attacker in a dark room. The judge wasn't buying that and called it the worst cold-blooded murder he's ever seen.\n\nThe prosecutor argued Gamet's actions were premeditated and deliberate. She stabbed Hill 11 times and had a history of violence against him.\n\nHill told police in March of 2013 she hit him in the head with a hammer.\n\nFamily members say justice was served and they hope a  lesson was learned about how abuse can come in all forms no matter the gender.", "date": "Apr 16, 2014", "views": "5,508,841 views", "comments": "10,992", "likes": "110,822 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 163.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8EMCiDqC1o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_HHuORgAow": {"title": "Police bodycam shows moment Florida deputy is stabbed in neck by suspect | New York Post", "content creator": "New York Post", "description": "A Florida sheriff\u2019s deputy was stabbed in the neck Sunday by a man who fled from police after he was told he was being committed to a mental health facility.\n\nThe dramatic episode was captured on Deputy Charles Williams\u2019 bodycam and released Monday by the Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThe New York Post is your source for breaking news, news about New York, sports, business, entertainment, opinion, real estate, culture, fashion, and more.\n\nCatch the latest news here: ", "date": "Oct 13, 2020", "views": "3,680,521 views", "comments": "7,659", "likes": "38,888 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 69.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_HHuORgAow"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTY9FaQbUuc": {"title": "Man Protects His Wife From THREE Home Invaders | I Survived a Crime | A&E", "content creator": "A&E", "description": "A man bravely protects his wife from three home invaders in this clip from Season 1, Episode 5.\n\n#ISurvivedACrime", "date": "Dec 6, 2021", "views": "3,182,805 views", "comments": "7,396", "likes": "45,774 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 143.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTY9FaQbUuc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiDqA-X_-n4": {"title": "Cotton To Top FBI Official: 'Did The DOJ Or FBI Have Any Plainclothes Officers' In Capitol On Jan 6?", "content creator": "Forbes Breaking News", "description": "At Tuesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen.

People are being urged to stay away from shores and evacuate to higher grounds. So far there have been no reported casualties.\nThe underwater eruption was so powerful that it was detected around the world. Satellite images show gas and ash being thrown thousands of meters into the Earth's atmosphere. \nCommunication links to Tonga have been damaged, but the capital of Tonga has sustained significant damage, says New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. \nPeople in New Zealand said they received no warning of the tsunami, even though the volcano's explosion could be heard in some parts of the country. \nMany were still out on the water on their boats, which have suffered severe damage. \nJapan was also put on high alert.

But massive expansion hasn't come without growing pains.\n\nIt's no secret that Starbucks has been struggling to get U.S. customers to frequent its cafes more often. While sales have been positive, the number of customer visits continues to stagnate.\n\nSame-store sales, a key metric in the restaurant industry, have dwindled over the last 12 months as competition heated up and customers were uninspired by some of Starbucks' limited-time offerings. While comparable-store sales exceeded expectations in the fourth quarter that ended Sept. 30, rising 4 percent, much of that was due Starbucks charging more for its lattes.\n\nUnder the careful watch of Howard Schultz, Starbucks pursued a strategy of aggressive expansion in the late '80s and early '90s. By the time the company went public in 1992, it had 165 stores.\n\nFour years later, Starbucks opened its 1,000th location, including international cafes in Japan and Singapore. Growth was so rapid that, just two years later, Starbucks opened its 2,000th cafe.\n\nWhile unit expansion helped boost sales throughout the last two decades \u2014 Starbucks has had positive same-store sales growth since 2010 \u2014 the company has now spread itself too thin.\n\nWith more than 14,000 locations in the United States alone today, Starbucks has cannibalized its own sales. The company is regrouping and rethinking its expansion. It is expected to shutter 150 underperforming locations in 2019, three times the amount it typically does.\n\nCompounding its problems are changing consumer preferences, an issue CEO Kevin Johnson has addressed with investors. People are shying away from sugar-laden calorie bombs, which happen to be one of Starbucks' staples. In 2015, sales of Frappuccinos were 14 percent of Starbucks revenue. However, in the first half of 2018, Frappucino sales were down 3 percent \u2014 and accounted for only about 11 percent of the company's revenue.\n\nMaking matters worse, Frappuccino sales also were hurt by a lack of innovation, analysts said.\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ", "date": "Jan 10, 2019", "views": "1,453,722 views", "comments": "965", "likes": "21,399 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 459.881, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUBeH7VQaFY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtv0o3X_R9U": {"title": "Big Mouth Bully Picks on Nerd, What happens Next will Shock You (2020)", "content creator": "Prince Ea", "description": "Childhood bully gets taught a lesson he will never forget!

Wecht then delivered a multimedia lecture on key areas of the Warren Commission\u2019s 1964 investigation, including President Kennedy\u2019s autopsy and the controversial single bullet theory. \n\nDr. Wecht began researching the Kennedy assassination when he was invited to speak before the 1965 meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. More than half a century later, Wecht continues to lecture and give media interviews on the assassination.

His mission was to rescue orphans from the wretched street life that enslaved so many children in England during the time of Charles Dickens and Oliver Twist. M\u00fcller did rescue, care for, feed, and educate such children by the thousands. The costs were enormous for such a great work. Yet, amazingly, he never asked anyone for money.

Walker (Executive Director, Independent Institute) to discuss Dr. Hanson's recent book, \"The Dying Citizen: How Progressive Elites, Tribalism, and Globalization Are Destroying the Idea of America.\"\n\nHuman history is full of the stories of peasants, subjects, and tribes. Yet the concept of the \u201ccitizen\u201d is historically rare\u2014and was among America\u2019s most valued ideals for over two centuries. But without shock treatment, warns Dr. Hanson, American citizenship as we have known it may soon vanish.\n\nIn \"The Dying Citizen,\" Dr. Hanson outlines the historical forces that led to this crisis. The evisceration of the middle class over the last fifty years has made many Americans dependent on the federal government. Open borders have undermined the idea of allegiance to a particular place. Identity politics have eradicated our social civic sense of self. And a top-heavy administrative state with formal efforts to weaken the Constitution has endangered personal liberty.\n\nAs in the revolutionary years of 1848, 1917, and 1968, 2020 ripped away our complacency about the future. But in the aftermath, we as Americans can rebuild and recover what we have lost. The choice is ours.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is the Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow in the Hoover Institution, the Wayne and Marcia Buske Distinguished Fellow in History at Hillsdale College, and a Member of the Board of Advisors for both the Independent Institute as well as the quarterly journal, \"The Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy.\" He received his Ph.D. in classics from Stanford University.

What is important is not inequality but human capital; once human capital is unleashed it creates an enormous amount of wealth for people of all classes.

He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.\n\nSowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.\n\nSowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).\n\nRobinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.\n\nInterested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

One Columbia psychology professor defined the term this way:\n\n    Microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.\n\nAfter exploring the limitations of a microaggression reporting system, we discussed broader free speech issues with the students in the wake of a month of campus protests that resulted in the resignations of several faculty members and a university president. \n\nMost of the students defended free speech in principle, if not always in practice. This is consistent with a recent Pew Research Center survey, which found that although 95 percent of Americans agree that people should be allowed to publicly criticize government policies, support erodes when the question turns to offensive speech. While a majority of millennials still believe that the government should protect speech offensive to minorities, a whopping 40 percent believe the government should restric such speech.\n\n\"If you say 'You're less of a person because you're Muslim/Jewish/Christian/Catholic... that's not okay.

He's an engineer and entrepreneur worth more than 15 billion dollars. He backs himself and his high-risk ventures, which invariably earn huge profits. First there was PayPal, the way to buy and sell on the internet. Then Tesla, the electric supercar he built. And SpaceX, the rocket company NASA uses - not bad for a 44-year-old guy. As Ross Coutlhart learns, Elon is not stopping there and his next venture is truly out of this world: the colonisation of Mars. If Elon Musk reminds you of Tony Stark - Ironman - you're right, because he is also the inspiration behind the Hollywood superhero.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ", "date": "May 12, 2021", "views": "1,155,879 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00EDFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E777F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D72E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D936B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D94546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x01079622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x0112882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F723E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F71443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E7D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E8B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x76E86359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x776087A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x77608774+180]\n", "likes": "16,593 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 789.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ippYts_JvUk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_jaU5V9FUg": {"title": "Lawsuits That Actually Weren't Ridiculous", "content creator": "LegalEagle", "description": "Sometimes lawsuits sound ridiculous, but when you dig in, you learn that they actually might have something to them. \nSign up for Morning Brew now!  https://legaleagle.link/morningbrew", "date": "Jun 26, 2021", "views": "2,170,029 views", "comments": "9,584", "likes": "87,766 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 993.361, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_jaU5V9FUg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpJRvawgNI": {"title": "", "content creator": "LegalEagle", "description": "", "date": "", "views": "", "comments": "7,404", "likes": "110,380 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1528.561, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpJRvawgNI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNnDvdtj9Us": {"title": "Real Lawyer Reacts to Liar Liar (Part 1)", "content creator": "LegalEagle", "description": "Jim Carrey (as attorney Fletcher Reede) is struck by a magic spell and can\u2019t lie.

Most lawyers do.  It is just a great movie that involves great lawyering.  Everyone should watch this movie.  But the question is: Is Vinny Gambini a good lawyer?  We'll find out today.\n\nThe movies starts with two students driving through the South on their way to California. Once they arrive in Alabama, they stop at a local convenience store to pick up a few snacks. The store clerk is murdered just after they leave and, in a case of mistaken identity, they are fingered for the crime.  Facing execution, the students do not have enough money for a lawyer, so they hire their cousin, Vincent Laguardia Gambini (Joe Pesci). After failing the bar 5 times, Vinny has been a lawyer for about six weeks and has to learn the process on the job.  Vinny has to defend his clients and battle an uncompromising judge, some tough locals, and even his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei).   \n\n(Thanks to Indochino for sponsoring this video and helping to make this channel possible)\n\nNew episodes weekly!

Myth 1 is that the government owes \u201conly\u201d $20 trillion. (In reality, it\u2019s much more.) But luckily, Myth 10 is that there\u2019s no way to fix this problem\u2026 \n\nMyth number one, the government owes $20 trillion. How much is $20 trillion? Suppose you go to Germany, and in Germany, you go to every town. In every town, you visit every store. In every store, you look at every shelf and grab everything that is for sale. The amount of money you spend will not be $20 trillion. If you go to Germany and then to France and you go to every town, and within every town, you go to every store. In every store, you look on every shelf and you buy everything. You still will not have spent $20 trillion. You can go to England and while you\u2019re there, you can go to the North Countries and buy everything that\u2019s for sale, and you still will not have spent $20 trillion. In fact, to spend $20 trillion, you have to go to every country in Europe, visit every town, in every town, go to every store. In every store, look on every shelf and buy everything. And then you will have spent about $20 trillion.\n\nBut the myth is that this is how much money the government owes. It turns out that there\u2019s more, called unfunded obligations. Unfunded obligations is money the Federal Government has promised but which it does not and will not have the money to pay. Largely, this consists of promises of retirement and medical benefits. If you would take the present value of all the future promises of retirement and medical benefits the government has made and subtract from that the amount of money that\u2019s in the government\u2019s Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and then subtract from that the amount of money the Federal Government anticipates collecting under the current law from future Social Security and Medicare taxes, you will still have an amount of money left over that the government does not have.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: ", "date": "Oct 16, 2017", "views": "2,811,905 views", "comments": "11,384", "likes": "52,834 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1271.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPjrFjAxwlw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnJEEdp6W24": {"title": "Stossel: Jordan Peterson vs. \u201cSocial Justice Warriors\u201d", "content creator": "ReasonTV", "description": "Many leftists hate Jordan Peterson, a Canadian psychologist and professor at the University of Toronto. \n\n---------\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: ", "date": "Jun 19, 2018", "views": "2,349,583 views", "comments": "7,879", "likes": "77,186 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 438.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnJEEdp6W24"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfO1veFs6Ho": {"title": "Gender Identity: Can a 5'9, White Guy Be a 6'5, Chinese Woman?", "content creator": "Family Policy Institute of Washington", "description": "FPIW visited the campus of the University of Washington to see if students would affirm or reject Joseph Backholm's new chosen identity: a 6'5\" Chinese woman.  \n\nFOLLOW AND SUPPORT US ONLINE!\n\nPatreon: ", "date": "Apr 13, 2016", "views": "5,196,989 views", "comments": "33,478", "likes": "101,940 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 253.721, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfO1veFs6Ho"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4VGQPk2Dl8": {"title": "Tesla Unveils Model 3", "content creator": "Tesla", "description": "Tesla Unveils Model 3\n\nLearn more: https://ts.la/2LW2uN4", "date": "Mar 31, 2016", "views": "6,019,774 views", "comments": "7,492", "likes": "87,292 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1363.321, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4VGQPk2Dl8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e50fQLyebI": {"title": "Students want top earners to pay their tuition", "content creator": "Fox Business", "description": "Million Student March national organizer Keely Mullen on protesting for free college and debt forgiveness.\nWatch Neil Cavuto talk about College Planning and Tuition Costs on Cavuto.", "date": "Nov 13, 2015", "views": "2,313,636 views", "comments": "21,412", "likes": "23,563 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 536.861, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e50fQLyebI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFLqYYRpNMQ": {"title": "How High Would You Make the Minimum Wage?

In the coming years, transportation companies must adapt to new technology, or risk getting left behind in a cloud of smoky diesel fumes.\n\nThe transportation sector contributes to a whopping 28% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and class 8 heavy-duty trucks account for 17% of the total fuel consumed by highway vehicles, despite comprising only 1% of vehicle\u2019s on the road. The electrification of medium and heavy duty trucks is an important and oft overlooked component of Tesla\u2019s mission to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\n\nThe Tesla semi pays for itself in just two years by providing $200,000 in fuel savings, and from day one costs just $1.26 per mile to operate, compared to $1.51 of a comparable diesel truck. Like other electric vehicles, it will require less maintenance, because there are less moving parts.\n\nIn terms of performance, the electric big rig is capable of an incredibly swift acceleration from 0 to 60 MPH in only 5 seconds! Or in 20 seconds when the Semi Truck is fully loaded to it\u2019s 80,000 lb capacity. An average diesel semi needs 15 seconds to go from 0 to 60 when empty, and a full minute when carrying a similar load!\n\nThe Tesla Semi\u2019s incredible performance is due in part to its streamlined aerodynamic design. The semi has a drag coefficient of 0.36, which is incredibly low when compared to the 0.65 of a standard truck, but shockingly, it even has a lower drag coefficient than a Bugatti Chiron.\n\nTesla says the semi will consume less than 2 kwh of energy per mile and have a 500 mile range. Performing some highly advanced mathematics,  we can ascertain we\u2019re looking at a roughly 1,000 kwh battery pack. That\u2019s 1 whole megawatt if your paying attention, 10 Times the size of the pack currently used in the Model S. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that the Semi is already making use of the new and improved tabless 4680 battery cells that were presented on Tesla\u2019s battery day. Elon said on twitter that they\u2019ve already been using the jumbo cells in prototype vehicles for several months, and in one slide he showed a Semi and Cybertruck as examples for high nickel cathode cells in heavy vehicles.\n\nLike all new ", "date": "Oct 24, 2020", "views": "1,429,659 views", "comments": "7,984", "likes": "36,637 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 923.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLQwKlH_mg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eu7b5c1Iqg": {"title": "What Happened After The Trial of the Chicago 7? | Netflix", "content creator": "Still Watching Netflix", "description": "Discover what happened to the real defendants in the Trial of the Chicago 7 after the film in this explainer video.\n\nThe film is based on the infamous 1969 trial of seven defendants charged by the federal government with conspiracy and more, arising from the countercultural protests in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

When Tesla Semis spied on it in different states, it appeared to be the same truck, but we can spot a few differences on closer inspection. So, what is different? And how do these prototypes differ from previous prototypes? \n\nQuestions like these are arising among people, especially those who were curious to know what's up with the Tesla semi-truck. In today's video, we will tell you how the Tesla semi-truck has wholly changed. Stay with us till the end of the video to find out what is new in the Tesla semi-truck.  \n\nFirst, Tesla has made some slight changes to the exterior of the Class 8 electric transporter that suggests the automaker is doing more R&D. By testing these trucks on public roads. Tesla has been collecting accurate data for several years. \nWe decided to compare a few of the Tesla semi-trucks recently spied on from behind - where different electrical boxes are installed in the back. This potentially indicates that Tesla is also experimenting with variable power and battery management systems. \nNow let's take a look at some of the significant changes that were initiated by Tesla in their semi-truck. \n\nThe length of the cabin on the roof is reduced by about 50%. This area previously extended to the entire length of the cabin.  \n\nThe height of the cabin on the roof is also significantly reduced, but Tesla has changed it from the start. This is probably done to get an optimal point between the \nWindow Enlargement / Cabine: The most significant change we have encountered in this prototype is expanding the \"window.\" Now it extends to about 70% of the aft cabin. We believe this could feature a transition converting the area to a cabin bed, as Tesla had previously hinted it was underway. In one of my 2018 Tesla Semi spotting posts, I assumed this area would be converted, and this space would be used as a sleeping cabin. \n\nA black box above the second cabin can be seen. This space was previously hollow. Truckers need a sleeper, and Tesla will surely give them one. \nThe rear-most panel has also been extruded, and the bottom curve has been shortened to accommodate the modified side profile. \n\nTesla semi truck change everything COMPLETELY!   \n\n\n\nWelcome to AUTO DRIVE In this channel we will explore the billionaire lifestyle and their amazing luxury cars.We will also dive into the revolutionary ev industry and discuss hybrid suv , hybrid cats , electric cars and everything renewable energy.\n\nSubscribe :", "date": "Nov 5, 2021", "views": "5,540 views", "comments": "4", "likes": "60 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 425.181, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViEd1em-nUA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPgYaLEpfX4": {"title": "Ingraham: This is what really happened today at the Capitol", "content creator": "Fox News", "description": "Pelosi\u2019s propagandistic production was a blatant, cheap attempt to deflect attention from cascade of calamities piling up under her Democrat majority. #FoxNews #TheIngrahamAngle", "date": "Jan 6, 2022", "views": "740,434 views", "comments": "5,889", "likes": "26,200 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 548.681, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPgYaLEpfX4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jtxuy-GJwCo": {"title": "Prof. Antony Davies: 5 Myths About Inequality", "content creator": "Learn Liberty", "description": "If you really want to understand how the world works today, you need to rethink almost everything you\u2019ve been told about inequality.

The blank dashboard and a small steering wheel coupled with the tablet interface give the truck the trademark Tesla aesthetic.\n\nNumber 7: Bullet-proof \n\nWe\u2019ve already discussed Tesla\u2019s new exo-skeleton and how it will be made out of the same material as the starship aircraft, so it\u2019s no surprise that the truck will be able to withstand 9mm ammunition that is commonly used in both handguns and machine guns. \n\n\n\nCHECK OUT OTHER VIDEOS:-\nDay in the Life of Elon Musk: ", "date": "Feb 23, 2021", "views": "4,157,548 views", "comments": "3,424", "likes": "64,204 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 417.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ5YD1GX1Y0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoDnzE7iw9E": {"title": "Webinar on \"Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8\"", "content creator": "Vietnam Peace Commemoration Committee", "description": "Webinar on \"Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8\"\n \na film by Jeremy Kagan\n\nPresented on November 20, 5 p.m. ET\n\nProgram \n\nJon Wiener, author of  \"Conspiracy in the Streets\"\nJeremy Kagan, film director and producer\nStuart Ball, attorney, defense team assistant to Lennie Weinglass\nLee Weiner, defendant\nCorinna Fales, unindicted coconspirator\nMichael Lembeck, actor (Abbie Hoffman) \nBobby Seale, defendant \nCarl Lumbly, actor (Bobby Seale)\nJohn McAuliff, Moderator, Vietnam Peace Commemoration Committee\nBrewster Rhoads, Timekeeper, Vietnam Peace Commemoration Committee\n\nWe organized a discussion of a film made in 1987 but still very timely.

Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. Rate and rhythm control medications are often a first course of action in managing AFib. If you don\u2019t respond to or can\u2019t tolerate drug therapy for AFib, catheter ablation may be recommended to treat your arrhythmia.

In particular he addresses the concept that eating certain foods may trigger a reaction in the heart, which may lead to initiation of Atrial Fibrillation. This video is suitable for patients who have long asked the question : Why does eating good trigger / cause AF? Why does drinking alcohol trigger AF? The link between the 2 is the autonomic nervous system. The concept of the vagus nerve and how it influences gut and heart function is explained. \n\nThe vagus nerve and Atrial Fibrillation is a well recognised link - and typically affects patients who have the propensity to develop AF after exercise, a large meal , or have AF triggered at night. However, the vagus can also be activated strongly by ingestion of meals and the intricate connections between the gut and heart\u2019s nervous system is the link that allows AF to be triggered. \n\nIn this video ,Dr Lim covers: \n1. The vagus nerve\n2. Why the vagus nerve triggers AF? \n3. Why feeling bloated causes AF? \n4. What is the relationship between eating and AF? \n5. Why is the role of the autonomic nervous system in AF?", "date": "May 8, 2020", "views": "94,659 views", "comments": "200", "likes": "1,539 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 470.181, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtW7_Vbp0zg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q0IxT0I83o": {"title": "Outrunning AFIB: A Testimonial", "content creator": "Desert Regional Medical Center", "description": "George Gust never thought he would get Atrial Fibrillation.

Please RSVP by November 29, 2021.\n\nMost Americans dismiss George III as a buffoon: a heartless and terrible monarch with few, if any, redeeming qualities (picture the preening, spitting, and pompous version in Hamilton). But in 2017, the Queen of England put 200,000 pages of the Georgian kings\u2019 private papers online, about half of which related to George III, and these papers have forced a full-scale reinterpretation of the king\u2019s life and reign. Roberts, an award-winning investigative historian (Churchill, Napoleon), had unprecedented access to these archives. The result is the first biography of King George III in fifty years, and the definitive one for our generation. The Last King of America: The Misunderstood Reign of George III will reverse this maligned monarch\u2019s reputation, showing that George III was in fact a wise, humane, and even enlightened monarch who was beset by talented enemies, debilitating mental illness, incompetent ministers, and disastrous luck.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nAndrew Roberts is the bestselling author of Churchill: Walking with Destiny; Leadership in War The Storm of War: A New History of the Second World War; Masters and Commanders: How Four Titans Won the War in the West, 1941-1945; Waterloo: Napoleon's Last Gamble; and Napoleon: A Life, winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for biography and a finalist for the Plutarch Award.
