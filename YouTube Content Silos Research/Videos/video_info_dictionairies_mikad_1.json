This specialized cancer treatment is best applied in children who are still growing.\n\nDuring this procedure, the surgeon removes the affected portion of bone, along with the knee joint. The major artery, vein, and nerve leading to the foot are saved.\n\nThe lower portion of the leg is rotated 180 degrees counter clockwise and then attached to the upper portion of the leg.\n\nThe ankle is now on the same plane as the former knee, with the foot and toes pointing backward and the heel facing forward. Because of the rotation, the ankle bends in the same direction as the knee.\n\nThe surgeon will take into account the age of the child and their growth potential. Initially, the surgically-modified knee center will be lower than the unaffected knee. As the child grows and bones lengthen, the knee centers will match.\n\nIn three to six months, after the bones have healed, the patient can be fitted for a prosthesis. The patient\u2019s foot fits inside the socket of the prosthesis and the ankle functions as the knee joint. In time, the patient will develop greater control, function and mobility. Most patients are able to walk unassisted and return to their regular activities, including playing sports.\n\nLearn more about rotationplasty and other specialized orthopedic oncology surgeries that can help preserve cancer patients' active lifestyles: ", "date": "Apr 20, 2019", "views": "13,451,924 views", "comments": "7,578", "likes": "200,364 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 100.481, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuMH3u0OLhA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5lENnRGei8": {"title": "Boy Surprises Childhood Best Friend Dressed As FedEx Driver", "content creator": "Happily", "description": "\ud83d\udc99 Subscribe to Happily for more feel-good videos: https://bit.ly/2yLeLS1\n\ud83d\udd14 Turn on all notifications so you don\u2019t miss an upload\n\nA thoughtful teen traveled across America to surprise his best friend since childhood dressed as a FedEx deliveryman - causing her legs to give way in complete shock. Soultana Kotrides, 16, and Jory Knauf, 15, became best friends growing up as neighbors in Rochester, New York, from 2006 until 2016, when Soultana's family moved to Fort Mill, South Carolina. Despite the distance between them, Soultana would still make an annual visit back to Rochester to visit Jory and his family. But this year, because of the precautions with COVID-19, that trip was canceled, adding to the disappointments Soultana was already facing during her senior year of high school. Knowing how sad this had made his best friend, Jory and the families started working on a plan to pay a surprise visit to South Carolina. Jory's mother, Lynn, purchased a deliveryman outfit from Amazon, and Soultana was told that her Greek grandmother had mailed her a package that she would like a video of her opening. As Jory and Lynn drove to South Carolina, they were frequently texting Soultana's dad John with updates. Ahead of the visit, all family members were also tested for COVID-19, John said, so that they knew the travel arrangements would not be spreading the virus. Then, when it was time for \u2018grandma\u2019s package\u2019 to arrive, the Kotrides family began filming Soultana as she went to collect it.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 Read the full story here: ", "date": "Sep 14, 2020", "views": "41,080,280 views", "comments": "3,747", "likes": "715,598 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 60, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5lENnRGei8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgoRz47x-JM": {"title": "Aunt May Finds Out \"WTF\" Ending Scene - Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) Movie Clip HD", "content creator": "ShortClips", "description": "Aunt May Finds Out Peter is Spiderman - \"What the fuck?!\" Funny Ending Scene - Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) Movie Clip HD [1080p]\n\nTM & \u00a9 Sony Pictures (2017)\nFair use.\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

(CUTEST DOG EVER)", "content creator": "Life with Malamutes", "description": "We told you that time was coming again!! Phil never learns as he gleefully wallows in mud galore! He's so happy until he's home and has to turn left at the top of the stairs, the realisation hits! The despair is real! The dog lives for peanut butter but he pretends its not there in a desperate bid to vanish. Phil mimics a statue as he stares into the wall trying to remain hidden! He is hilarious in his characteristics I'm sure you'll agree...\n\nSo things took a different turn this time. Harley (Phil's favourite person) offered to wash Phil to see if the situation could be more pleasing for him. First off she tried reasoning but it wasn't working. She tried to take a more forceful approach but Phil was adamant it wasn't happening! \n\nHe is such a big baby all the drama before to then get in and be fine, sometimes he remembers when he is in the bath and starts to act again but generally once the ordeal of getting in is over he is pretty much fine! \n\nIf this is the first time you've seen Phil take a bath and long for more of this, don't worry we got you covered! There are a few Phil bath saga's in our library just search 'sulking dog'\n\nMilo has also suffered the wrath of the bath, only once though haha he was quite chill actually!\n\nNiko doesn't min the bath and in the last video she even got in to show off!\n\nPhil starts throwing a tantrum and Niko gets wind of this so the two start howling mid video - it's quite loud in a bathroom haha. \n\nOf course Mia was there for support once again, she even tries to help wash her teddy bear at one point, she doesn't want to see him upset!\n\nBut the golden moments are Harley's failures. You can't not laugh along with this one. Phil is so heavy and when he doesn't want to move its nearly impossible, couple that with his sad crying and frantic pivot turning it's so funny!\n\nThanks for watching guys. See you next time.

Turn the screwdriver clockwise to remove the disc from the system. This will remove the disc from your PS5. If it's the first time this happens, don't worry.

But big dreams and spectacular hits also call for a bigger stage than the Moon Theater. The Crystal Tower Theater in the glamorous big city would be perfect - but there's one small problem. Actually, three. First, Buster Moon, mother pig Rosita, rocker porcupine Ash, elephant Meena, gorilla Johnny and pop provocateur, pig Gunter, must somehow make it to the office of music mogul Jimmy Crystal and convince the unscrupulous wolf to let them use his theater. It's a hopeless endeavor until Gunter spontaneously promises him the scoop: rock legend Clay Calloway (Bono) will return to the stage for this show! The problem: Buster has never met Clay, a lion who has retired from show business! While Moon's all-star ensemble works to put on the spectacular show, the koala sets out to find Clay. What begins as a dream of great success becomes an emotional reminder of the healing power of music.\n\n\u00a9 Universal Pictures", "date": "Dec 9, 2021", "views": "2,732,260 views", "comments": "974", "likes": "42,462 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 90.301, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdlgmnhs12o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-22UBL5E9Zw": {"title": "Stunning new evidence revealed in Oxford High School shooting", "content creator": "WXYZ-TV Detroit | Channel 7", "description": "Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald in a new court filing says their case against the parents of the accused Oxford School shooter is \u201cstronger\u201d and that Jennifer and James Crumbley are \u201cat a greater risk of flight\u201d now.", "date": "Dec 23, 2021", "views": "2,708,186 views", "comments": "9,060", "likes": "24,154 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 349.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-22UBL5E9Zw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niG3YMU6jFk": {"title": "Adele - Oh My God (Official Video)", "content creator": "Adele", "description": "Official Video for \"Oh My God\" by Adele.\nShop the \"Adele\" collection here: http://shop.adele.com\n \nListen to \"30\" here: ", "date": "Premiered Jan 12, 2022", "views": "23,511,916 views", "comments": "30,767", "likes": "846,345 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 232.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niG3YMU6jFk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXXoO0FwUKQ": {"title": "How I Hacked The US Government Aged 16 | Minutes With | @LADbible TV", "content creator": "LADbible TV", "description": "In this weeks episode of Minutes With we sat down with Mustafa Al-Bassam, a former member of Anonymous and one of the founders of LulzSec.\n\nMustafa tells us how he got in to hacking and how he ended up getting involved in attacks on The Sun, The Westboro Baptist Church and even the US Government.\n\nSubscribe To Our Channel: ", "date": "May 30, 2021", "views": "3,813,451 views", "comments": "3,944", "likes": "88,973 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 855.901, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXXoO0FwUKQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5C3rkfdkSk": {"title": "Celebrities Surprising Fans Compilation 2020 (NEW)", "content creator": "Celeb Lounge", "description": "Celebrities Surprising Fans Compilation 2020 (NEW)\nHere are the best celebrity surprises to fans!\n\nSingers Surprised by Fans Singing Skills (Beyonce, Ariana Grande, Charlie Puth, Rihanna, Adele) ", "date": "May 2, 2020", "views": "550,289 views", "comments": "267", "likes": "7,872 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 680.941, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5C3rkfdkSk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu7lJ5okjyo&list=RDMMlu7lJ5okjyo&start_radio=1": {"title": "", "content creator": "The Weeknd", "description": "", "date": "", "views": "", "comments": "6,319", "likes": "146,696 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 202.181, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu7lJ5okjyo&list=RDMMlu7lJ5okjyo&start_radio=1"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YZ0A1VzLjs": {"title": "10 Things A Narcissist Would Say", "content creator": "Psych2Go", "description": "Are you dealing with a narcissist right now?

For the past year we have lived in a 30' RV as a family of 5. Josh has continued to work full time, commuting 2 hours to and from work in the city so we can pay for the build with cash and remain debt free. Meanwhile, I have been caring for the kids, the household and running the farm. In the evenings we come together to build the house. This video shows our progress throughout the first year sped up as to only take 20 minutes to view. You can see ALL the progress we have made since this video, including what you see in the thumbnail, on our channel. Each individual project is broken down to its own video where you get a better look at each step.  \n* We will continue documenting every step of the build after this timelapse so be sure to stick around*\nLinks to products we use:\n\nMr. Heater we use in our RV: ", "date": "May 15, 2019", "views": "45,531,463 views", "comments": "25,101", "likes": "539,122 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1113.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9md3fIfMWiQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SChqbCDI2_E": {"title": "Quick live for fun\ud83e\udd70", "content creator": "Emelda Nakamura", "description": "", "date": "Streamed live on Jan 12, 2022", "views": "937 views", "comments": "2", "likes": "130 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 21743.481, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SChqbCDI2_E"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwyU08BCk_E": {"title": "Not interested in reporters\u2019 questions: Biden\u2019s pathetic media record revealed", "content creator": "Sky News Australia", "description": "Joe Biden has delivered fewer interviews and media conferences in his first year than the last five presidents at the same point in their terms.\n\nWith President Biden\u2019s last media conference 70 days ago, pressure is mounting on The White House to deliver on its promise of transparency.\n\nPresident Biden in his first year gave nine media conferences which is less than half compared to his five predecessors.\n\nDonald Trump held 22, Barack Obama 27, George W Bush 19, Bill Clinton 38 and George HW Bush 31.\n\n\u201cHe was most interested in giving speeches and not in responding to reporters\u2019 questions,\u201d White House Transition Project Director Martha Kumar said. \n\nWhen it comes to interviews, President Biden delivered just 22 or less than a quarter of Mr Trump.", "date": "Jan 11, 2022", "views": "20,878 views", "comments": "294", "likes": "732 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 154.241, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwyU08BCk_E"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ZccPoSA6M": {"title": "Meet The Men On Death Row (Prison Documentary) | Our Life", "content creator": "Our Life", "description": "In this eye-opening documentary we meet the men living on death row.
