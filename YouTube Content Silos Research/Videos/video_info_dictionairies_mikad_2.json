Miranda, who visited Colombia with directors Jared Bush and Byron Howard in 2018, infused the songs with the rhythms, instrumentation and varied styles of the South American country\u2019s music. \u201c\u2019Encanto\u2019 takes place in rural Colombia,\u201d said Miranda, \u201cand the music that comes out of Colombia is so beautiful.\u201d\n \nIn the film, Mirabel often reveals her internal struggles and revelations through song. Said Beatriz, \u201cThere\u2019s something that clicks inside her where she realizes the wheels are in motion for her to chase down her destiny. I like these heroine songs so much. We go on this major journey with the character and suddenly we know her better from the inside.\u201d\n \nCelebrate with Miranda, Beatriz and the rest of the \u201cEncanto\u201d family when \u201cEncanto\u201d debuts on Disney+ on Christmas Eve.  \n\nwww.instagram.com/encantomovie\nwww.twitter.com/encantomovie", "date": "Dec 20, 2021", "views": "3,708,402 views", "comments": "1,501", "likes": "60,963 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 229.381, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQf3RRQuSxE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQmjXM4VK2U": {"title": "The French Revolution - OverSimplified (Part 2)", "content creator": "OverSimplified", "description": "Install Raid for Free \u2705 IOS: http://bit.ly/IOS_Oversimplified \u2705 ANDROID: http://bit.ly/Oversimplified1 Start with 50K silver and get a Free Epic Champion  on day 7 of \u201cNew Player Rewards\u201d program!\n\nMERCH (NEW LIMITED STOCK CHARACTER PINS!!) - ", "date": "Jun 28, 2019", "views": "20,039,533 views", "comments": "28,340", "likes": "364,980 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1331.761, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQmjXM4VK2U"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uylGt3HL3g8": {"title": "When Talk Show Hosts Make Celebrities Uncomfortable", "content creator": "Enigma", "description": "When Talk Show Hosts Make Celebrities Uncomfortable", "date": "Jan 16, 2020", "views": "8,573,843 views", "comments": "18,192", "likes": "98,366 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 602.321, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uylGt3HL3g8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNPkJ7eEVDU": {"title": "Tony Stark & Steve Rogers Chopping Wood Scene - Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Movie CLIP HD", "content creator": "TopMovieClips", "description": "Tony Stark and Steve Rogers Chopping Wood - Argument Scene - Tony Stark and Nick Fury - Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Movie CLIP HD [1080p 60 FPS] \n\nTM & \u00a9 Disney / Marvel (2015)\nFair use. \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

In this video we cover the 12 signs of a sociopath. Sociopathy can be hard to spot especially if the person with those traits is someone close to you.\n\nSociopaths are some of the most dangerous people in the world with recent studies reporting they make up to 4% of the American population. That means 1 in every 25 people could be a sociopath. \n\nWhat makes this even scarier is how easily they charm and manipulate the people around them, making them appear as innocent as a kitten.

The exhausted climbers were soon lost in a fierce blizzard and far from the safety of Camp 4 at 26,000 feeet.

Over the entire season, 12 people died trying to reach the summit, making it the deadliest season on Mount Everest at the time and the third deadliest after the 16 fatalities of the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche and the 22 resulting from avalanches caused by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. The 1996 disaster received widespread publicity and raised questions about the commercialization of Everest.\n\nNumerous climbers were at a high altitude on Everest during the storm, including the Adventure Consultants team, led by Rob Hall, and the Mountain Madness team, led by Scott Fischer. While climbers died on both the North Face and South Col approaches, the events on the South Face were more widely reported. Four members of the Adventure Consultants expedition perished, including Hall, while Fischer was the sole casualty of the Mountain Madness expedition. Three officers of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police also died.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Frontline\ncir: 2008\nDirector: David Breashears", "date": "Apr 2, 2021", "views": "2,079,784 views", "comments": "2,916", "likes": "22,123 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6064.341, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So3vH9FY2H4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1RnEzXjIN0": {"title": "Guessing Rent in New York City", "content creator": "Shan Rizwan", "description": "I interview people in New York City by guessing how much do people pay in rent to live in New York City!

Filmmakers Gregor M\u00f6llers and Anne Lewald discretely shot the video on trips to North Korea in 2013 and 2017, when they were not allowed autonomy or spontaneity.\n\nDespite the fact that their itinerary was arranged for them in advance and guides chaperoned them everywhere, the two Berliners found a way to register their impressions. They depict a city lacking authenticity, a country longing for reunification and a people shaped by Juche beliefs and socialist propaganda. In a society steeped in obfuscation and spectacle, where deception is necessary for perception and expression, the filmmakers were forced to play a double role, secretly recording without permission while also genuinely relating to their hosts. By blending travelogue and espionage, A Postcard from Pyongyang captures what happens when you rely solely on what you see, not what you\u2019re told, and reveals a reality Kim Jong-Un\u2019s regime doesn\u2019t want foreigners to see.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

As Maximoff transfers her magic, she creates magical runes around the barrier to strip Harkness of her powers and traps Agnes permanently inside Westview, becoming the Scarlet Witch in the process.\n\nI love Marvel comics and movies but in this scene, I think there is a plothole I want to share with you. Let's say that Wanda had an incredible photographic memory to remember all those runes. When Wanda used runes to take Agatha's power and if Agatha couldn't use magic inside runes, then how was she still flying? And if you say what if Wanda was controlling her? Then how didn't she notice that she was floating?\n\nWhat do you think of Wanda playing upon Agatha? How could Agatha avoid that? Why Hadn't Wanda known about her power up until then?

Nearly all Mennonites live in self-sufficient colonies, embracing isolation, which helps protect them from the temptations of the modern world. Now, for the first time, one of these communities has agreed to open their doors to our cameras.\nAt first sight, time seems to have stopped in the colony of Little Belize, in South America. People travel around on horse-drawn carriages and still speak Plattdeutsch, an old German dialect. But even here, signs of the outside world are creeping in. Wilhelm, the community\u2019s former doctor, was recently expelled for owning a mobile phone. Fearing their community is being tainted, some traditional members, like Abram and his family, have decided to create a new colony, even more isolated, in the jungle of Peru, where they can remain true to their original doctrine.\nWe follow them on their exodus and take an unprecedented look at the world of the Mennonites.\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: ", "date": "Oct 27, 2021", "views": "1,998,532 views", "comments": "3,613", "likes": "18,749 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3102.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWfGXOjBF2E"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8bKblC1yPc": {"title": "Twins Merle and Stijn talking to each other oftewel: Stijn en Merle babbelen er op los!", "content creator": "Roy Johannink", "description": "De eerste keer dat Stijn en Merle met elkaar begonnen te babbelen. \nEen heerlijk filmpje! #goedleven", "date": "May 7, 2011", "views": "26,909,110 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00EDFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E777F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D72E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D936B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D94546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x01079622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x0112882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F723E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F71443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E7D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E8B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x76E86359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x776087A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x77608774+180]\n", "likes": "73,517 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 45.141, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8bKblC1yPc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETnLewwT2qQ": {"title": "Oceans (Where Feet May Fail) - Hillsong United | Instrumental Worship | Fundo Musical", "content creator": "Deeper Heaven Music", "description": "Listen on digital platforms (Spotify, Deezer, Itunes and others):\nhttps://deeperheavenmusic.hearnow.com/", "date": "May 31, 2020", "views": "17,940,171 views", "comments": "6,700", "likes": "235,040 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3882.561, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETnLewwT2qQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqWkwolb3as": {"title": "How Popeyes Be Training They Employees", "content creator": "RDCworld1", "description": "How Popeyes be Training they employees \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d bro Popeyes employees be rude as hell what is wrong with them.

Soultana Kotrides, 16, and Jory Knauf, 15, became best friends growing up as neighbors in Rochester, New York, from 2006 until 2016, when Soultana's family moved to Fort Mill, South Carolina. Despite the distance between them, Soultana would still make an annual visit back to Rochester to visit Jory and his family. But this year, because of the precautions with COVID-19, that trip was canceled, adding to the disappointments Soultana was already facing during her senior year of high school. Knowing how sad this had made his best friend, Jory and the families started working on a plan to pay a surprise visit to South Carolina. Jory's mother, Lynn, purchased a deliveryman outfit from Amazon, and Soultana was told that her Greek grandmother had mailed her a package that she would like a video of her opening. As Jory and Lynn drove to South Carolina, they were frequently texting Soultana's dad John with updates. Ahead of the visit, all family members were also tested for COVID-19, John said, so that they knew the travel arrangements would not be spreading the virus. Then, when it was time for \u2018grandma\u2019s package\u2019 to arrive, the Kotrides family began filming Soultana as she went to collect it.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 Read the full story here: ", "date": "Sep 14, 2020", "views": "41,080,314 views", "comments": "3,747", "likes": "715,600 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 60.361, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5lENnRGei8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0lXHpRJ9t8": {"title": "15,000 Dominoes - Harry Potter HOGWARTS HOUSES!", "content creator": "Hevesh5", "description": "#WBpromotion To celebrate the 20th anniversary of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\", I\u2019ve set up 15,000 dominoes that highlight the Sorting Hat placing people into the 4 Hogwarts houses: Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin!

(CUTEST DOG EVER)", "content creator": "Life with Malamutes", "description": "We told you that time was coming again!! Phil never learns as he gleefully wallows in mud galore! He's so happy until he's home and has to turn left at the top of the stairs, the realisation hits! The despair is real! The dog lives for peanut butter but he pretends its not there in a desperate bid to vanish. Phil mimics a statue as he stares into the wall trying to remain hidden! He is hilarious in his characteristics I'm sure you'll agree...\n\nSo things took a different turn this time. Harley (Phil's favourite person) offered to wash Phil to see if the situation could be more pleasing for him. First off she tried reasoning but it wasn't working. She tried to take a more forceful approach but Phil was adamant it wasn't happening! \n\nHe is such a big baby all the drama before to then get in and be fine, sometimes he remembers when he is in the bath and starts to act again but generally once the ordeal of getting in is over he is pretty much fine! \n\nIf this is the first time you've seen Phil take a bath and long for more of this, don't worry we got you covered! There are a few Phil bath saga's in our library just search 'sulking dog'\n\nMilo has also suffered the wrath of the bath, only once though haha he was quite chill actually!\n\nNiko doesn't min the bath and in the last video she even got in to show off!\n\nPhil starts throwing a tantrum and Niko gets wind of this so the two start howling mid video - it's quite loud in a bathroom haha. \n\nOf course Mia was there for support once again, she even tries to help wash her teddy bear at one point, she doesn't want to see him upset!\n\nBut the golden moments are Harley's failures. You can't not laugh along with this one. Phil is so heavy and when he doesn't want to move its nearly impossible, couple that with his sad crying and frantic pivot turning it's so funny!\n\nThanks for watching guys. See you next time.

Rowling book, but J.K. is problematic af so IDGAF anymore--Harry Potter belongs to the people now (also, J.K. wrote the Fantastic Beasts movies, which aren't spectacular).\n\nI definitely want this to happen sometime in the future. I strongly believe in keeping beloved films alive, relevant, and talked about. Great movies/properties/franchises should always be celebrated and known. While Harry Potter is being kept alive through the Wizarding World universe of the Fantastic Beasts movies, as well as the Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park attraction at Universal Studios, it'd be nice to see the original gang get back together. This film would bring back Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, (maybe) Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, and pretty much everybody else.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you want to see another Hogwarts adventure with Harry, Ron, & Hermione? Should it be an adaptation of The Cursed Child or should it be an original story?

Three, in fact, as under the reddish sand there is brown sandstone \u2013 the fossilised dunes of an ancient Namib. Then there is the World Heritage Site of \u2018Namib Sand Sea\u2019, and only 60 km further south, the Namib shows yet another face: the valley of the ephemeral Tsauchab River \u2013 which cuts through the surging sand-sea and ends in famed Sossusvlei.\nBut along with the fossilised dunes, Namib Sand Sea and Tsauchab River, a glorious new display has risen.\n\nBuilt in 2006, the special character of this waterhole, has not only an impact on the surrounding wildlife, but stretches across the globe, from home to home. This particular waterhole is situated within an open plain, 8km from Namib Desert Lodge. \n\nA solar-powered borehole fills a nearby reservoir and is monitored by a water float that opens as the waterhole\u2019s levels decline.\n\nBeing situated within a remote destination like the Namib Desert, intermittent interruptions are likely to occur at times. \n\nFrequently asked questions:\nhttps://gondwana-collection.com/water...\n\nGPS coordinates : -24.074923, 15.887410\n\nFor more Info click the links below: \n\nNamib Desert Lodge: https://bit.ly/nam-cam-namib-desert-l... \nGondwana Namib Park: https://bit.ly/gondwana-namib-park-in... \nThe Namib Experience: https://bit.ly/the-namib-experience \nNamib Dune Star Camp: https://bit.ly/namibdunestarcamp \nThe Desert Grace: https://bit.ly/thedesertgrace \nDesert Whisper: https://bit.ly/desertwhisper\nBuy Namibian Products Online: https://bit.ly/namibia-merchandise\n\n\nAnd yes, while we\u2019re all for freedom, there is however a few group regulations that we would like members to adhere to. \n- Be kind, positive and helpful to other viewers and treat them like you want to be treated.\n- Do not promote other channels or products. \n- Keep the chat friendly and informative.

So today we'll be digging a bit deeper into the lore and lesser-known details of this legendary city.

Check his channel out, and tell him to check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000\nThis is a brief and funny representation of the colonization of America... but with Countryballs. Here is some more info:\n- The Spanish colonization began in 1493, and it was conducted by the Spanish conquistadors. They colonized the most territory of America, expanding from the South to the North. Their interests were in extracting gold and silver.\n- The Portuguese arrived to America around the year 1500. Their interest in this territory (which would become Brazil) was to use it as a trade post.\n- The Russian established their first colonies and trading posts in America in 1784, in the territory now known as Alaska. They later sold this territory to the United States.\n- The French colonized North America in the year 1534. Their intentions were to create trading posts for the fur trade. Eventually, they sent missionaries to turn Native Americans into Catholics.\n- The UK took some time to start colonizing North America. By 1607 they established their first colony. Their intentions were to establish colonies to sell more resources than the ones they were buying.\nWe hope you enjoy this MrBeast animation.\n\nYOUTUBE PRODUCERS:\n- Mexico Mapper\n- Mr Kartoffel\n- Dave Wasn't Already Taken 2\n- Maggie Prince\n- Dodido101 roblox\n- BlueDiamondBelle\n- ShockTriC\n- Jearbear Gaming\n\nJoin our secret epic membership for perks.

It's a relief for some parents and children. But as Heather Yourex-West reports, there are no guarantees schools will stay open.\n\nThe Omicron surge was also at the top of the agenda as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held a call with Canada's premiers. From warnings of vaccine mandates, to pressure over approving COVID-19 antiviral pills, David Akin explains what was discussed and what it means for Canadians.\n\nMeanwhile, after a high-stakes legal battle, Novak Djokovic's visa has been reinstated, so he can stay in Australia and compete in the Australian Open. But as Eric Sorensen explains, that does not mean the tennis champion is in the clear yet.\n\nPlus, Britain's monarchy will soon celebrate an historic anniversary, as Queen Elizabeth prepares for her Platinum Jubilee, marking an unprecedented 70 years on the throne.

On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice discuss the emergence of the new Omicron Variant of COVID-19 with biomedical scientist and president of Regeneron, George Yancopoulos. \n\nHow do we create antibodies for infectious diseases? We explore ebola, the Will Smith movie I Am Legend, and special rats with human immune systems! Find out how the immune system makes antibodies and how people can become resistant to a disease. What is \u201cviral load\u201d?  What\u2019s the difference between making vaccines and making antibody treatment? We take a deep dive into the science at the front lines of the pandemic. \n\nWe break down how vaccines work and what monoclonal antibodies are. What\u2019s the difference between mutations of Covid and mutations of the flu? Will we be getting a Covid shot every year? How do we help immunocompromised people who can\u2019t get vaccinated? What does immunocompromised actually mean for their immune system? How does a virus mutate anyway?\n\nWhat goes behind the naming of the new variants? We take some hard-hitting patron questions like: How is Regeneron working to treat cytokine storms that seem to cause clotting in youth populations? What even is a cytokine? Learn about how our immune systems work to save us, but also how they can put us in danger, too. How do you get medical info out onto the front lines? Should we be worried about every mutation? Would too many false alarms make people ignore a real threat? How do you prevent panic? Is there a glimmer of hope in this new variant? We discuss how it is possible that a new variant could outcompete a current strain and make an overall less deadly version of Covid. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice? All that, plus, Chuck offers some new pandemic-themed video game ideas to pass the time with. \n\nThanks to our Patrons Vincent Krohn, Eu, Valeritte (Chuck, just call me Val), Austin McCauley, Avneesh Joshi, Timothy Lew, and Nikki Amberg for supporting us this week.\n\nNOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can watch or listen to this entire episode commercial-free.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: ", "date": "Dec 9, 2021", "views": "909,704 views", "comments": "3,637", "likes": "24,373 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3378.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Oww1OS5IY4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psaLIYc57IU": {"title": "Hillary Clinton 2024 talks heat up as she takes shot at far-left lawmakers", "content creator": "Fox News", "description": "'Outnumbered' weighs in on Hillary Clinton taking a shot at progressive Democrats. #FoxNews\n\nSubscribe to Fox News! https://bit.ly/2vaBUvAS", "date": "Jan 12, 2022", "views": "288,562 views", "comments": "2,466", "likes": "6,669 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 437.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psaLIYc57IU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbGgq-HlKWc": {"title": "\"It's Not Possible For A Restaurant To Be So Bad\" | Kitchen Nightmares", "content creator": "Kitchen Nightmares", "description": "Gordon throws a microwave out of the window, the saddest moment in Kitchen Nightmares history.

First steam, to electric, gasoline, and today\u2019s hybrids, the evolution of safety features in cars plays an essential role in reducing the once overwhelming number of injuries and damages resulting from auto accidents. Auto manufacturers have come a long way over the history of auto safety, paving the way for improved global safety standards.\n\nUnfortunately, as a vehicle ages, a number of factors come into play that reduce the automobiles safety, aside from mechanical wear and tear. According to statistics, a driver is 10 times as likely to suffer fatal injuries in a collision while operating a 30-year-old vehicle versus a late model. The auto industry is continually working to improve the safety of current mechanisms, as well as developing and testing new ideas for safer vehicles. Developments in driving technology and new types of airbags have been prevalent just this year.\n\nWhile the ultimate safe vehicle may be a long way off, American auto manufacturers have made significant strides in improving the overall security and protection a vehicles structure provides. Over the past 3 decades, fatal accidents in the U.S. have decreased by more than 1/5, a substantial decrease demonstrating immense progress in terms of the safety features in cars.\n\nThe need to revolutionize auto safety was not fully realized until the 1950s, when the first usable airbags were developed, among other safety mechanisms. Then, in 1970, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was created. The organization still uses the same name today, and continues its role in promoting and effectively executing driving safety regulations throughout the U.S. Whether creating new policies or revising existing regulations (at the state and federal level), the NHTSA and the United States have been true catalysts in the history of car safety.", "date": "May 12, 2020", "views": "7,406,857 views", "comments": "3,870", "likes": "60,601 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 271.721, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TikJC0x65X0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0YGLDafG1o": {"title": "What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview", "content creator": "Asian Boss", "description": "As the US-China relations continue to deteriorate, the issue of Taiwan just keeps popping up, but let\u2019s be honest - most of us have no idea what's going on in Taiwan or what Taiwanese people are thinking.
