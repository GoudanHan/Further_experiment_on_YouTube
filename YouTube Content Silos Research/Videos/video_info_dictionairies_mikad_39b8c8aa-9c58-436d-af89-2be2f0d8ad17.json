This Wind Ensemble features  the top musicians of Lincoln High Stockton and is conducted by Directors Cathy Ettle, Kristin Florek and Jazareth Valencia.\n\n\n   Joie De Vivre(the Joy of Living) is a celebration of community. It imagines a reunion of people, having been separated by time and hardship, who came together under the banner of music and camaraderie. Written for symphonic winds, percussion, and marching band, Joie De Vivre  takes it\u2019s inspiration from the famous second line parade bands found in New Orleans. Dubbed the quintessential New Orleans art form, these \u201cfunerals without a body\u201d are held for any kind of event that people feel merits a parading band (weddings, birthdays, or in this case, a conference for music educators!)\n The piece begins with a solo clarinet, who sends out a call that is time to get the party started. A marching band assembles, and along with the clarinet, they begin to summon the rest of the revelers to join in. The work moves through the Blues, Dixieland, and ragtime styles before the full ensemble finally comes together into a rousing conclusion. \nThis piece was commissioned by Leander High School band for the performance of their 2021 Midwest clinic. We were lucky enough to hear their performance and decided immediately knew that we would open our CASMEC performance with this joyful piece of music.\n\nCathy Ettle, Director\n\nNicholas Ebbers - Clarinet\nKyndred Lewis- French Horn\nKeagan Low \u2013 Trumpet\nEli Hancock \u2013 Trombone\nAlejandro Villalobos- Sousaphone\nDustin De Witt - Bass Drum and whistle\nTrish Pangan-Kennedy - Snare\nCamile Brown -Tambourine", "date": "Feb 19, 2022", "views": "715 views", "comments": "0", "likes": "24 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 302.321, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY8O5QZRTPE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKB9kdXZHf8": {"title": "Worship - February 20, 2022", "content creator": "Madison CofC", "description": "Thank you for gathering with us this week!

This Japanese Family of 3 with Japanese husband shows how life in Tokyo is like for a new Japanese mother raising a Japanese baby.  We follow Moe, 27 year old Japanese mother of Sutan, a 9-month old Japanese infant, from morning until evening to show what type of activities a Japanese mom has during the day.  Inside of their Japanese home in Tokyo, we can see what type of Japanese house chores she performs, what type of Japanese food she cooks and how she takes care of her Japanese daughter.  This probably would not be considered an average Japanese family but many of their activities are that of a typical Japanese family.  This day in the life of Japanese housewife and Japanese baby will feature the joys and struggles a mom has raising a Japanese baby for the first time.  Life in Japan starts here as baby and you can see how certain behaviors are taught to babies like saying itadakimasu before the baby eats.  I hope you enjoy watching the life of this Tokyo family and their life in Tokyo.  \n\nWatch more Japan Day in the Life Series (Playlist):\n- ", "date": "Feb 14, 2020", "views": "17,053,964 views", "comments": "32,313", "likes": "421,844 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 956.141, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrniEJHByV4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-xXDmITaBA": {"title": "You Need To Have Routines And Schedules! - Jordan Peterson Motivation", "content creator": "SUCCESS CHASERS", "description": "Jordan Peterson's Audiobook available for free here - https://amzn.to/2zpqHt2\nYou Need To Have Routines And Schedules! - Jordan Peterson Motivation\n\n===================================================\n\nSpeaker: Jordan Peterson", "date": "Oct 22, 2020", "views": "336,027 views", "comments": "247", "likes": "11,082 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 662.141, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-xXDmITaBA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye4vL7u6N2g": {"title": "Lec 3 | MIT 14.01SC Principles of Microeconomics", "content creator": "MIT OpenCourseWare", "description": "Lecture 3: Elasticity\nInstructor: Jon Gruber, 14.01 students\nView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/14-01SCF10", "date": "Jan 24, 2012", "views": "346,671 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x009CFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x009677F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00862E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0088E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0088E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008B9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008A7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008B75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008A7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008836B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00884546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00B69622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00C1882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00A623E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00A61443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0096D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00971518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00971660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0097B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x757C6359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x774E87A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x774E8774+180]\n", "likes": "2,620 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2877.861, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye4vL7u6N2g"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BickMFHAZR0": {"title": "How Trees Bend the Laws of Physics", "content creator": "Veritasium", "description": "Hope this was worth the wait!

This is what a typical day working in Japan is like at a Toy company as a Japanese worker.  We see Japanese work culture throughout the day and see how it is to work in japan as well how it is to live in Japan during this time before work and after work. Kana works at Sega Toys, creating some of the most popular toys in Japan, formed in 1998 from its parent company Sega, one of the largest video game and entertainment companies in the world.  Although many of the Sega Sammy companies are located in the same building, Sega Toys operate independently with 110 hard working staff to create award winning toys even with major brands like anpanman and disney. Kana is originally from Aichi prefecture but moved to Yamanashi prefecture to attend university majoring in Regional Sociology.  Like many Japanese university students, she started her shushoku katsdo, aka Job Hunting while in school and was able to secure employment before graduation which led her to Tokyo to start a new life and career.

But knowing where it is isn't the end of the story - Richard also has to convince authorities to resume the search that's already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: ", "date": "Feb 20, 2022", "views": "1,783,736 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x009CFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x009677F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00862E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0088E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0088E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008B9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008A7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008B75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008A7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008836B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00884546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00B69622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00C1882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00A623E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00A61443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0096D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00971518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00971660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0097B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x757C6359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x774E87A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x774E8774+180]\n", "likes": "30,907 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1192.961, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq-d4Kl8Xh4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MzMiiu3sYM": {"title": "The Windows 11 Phone!", "content creator": "Beebom", "description": "We got a phone to run full fledged Windows 11 and surprisingly, the experience is fairly good.

Leeper | TEDxVienna", "content creator": "TEDx Talks", "description": "Heart disease and cancer are the two leading killers, worldwide. Traditionally, scientists have viewed these as distinct entities, with different biological origins necessitating distinct therapeutic approaches. However, emerging epidemiological and genetic evidence suggests these disorders may not be as unique as previously imagined, and that the two diseases may actually arise via a collection of shared and overlapping pathways. In this lecture, we will review the evidence supporting this claim, and describe how the medical field might leverage these observations to simultaneously target the two greatest causes of mortality. Dr. Leeper is a Professor of Surgery and the Chief of Vascular Medicine at Stanford University.  He is a practicing cardiologist and co-founder of two biotechnology companies, 47 Inc. and Bitterroot Bio, which aim to prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease.

As the liberal global order is further eroded by identity politics and woke ideology, Professor Stokes and John consider the impacts of these progressive movements and a way forward. They seek sources of hope for a divided West and discuss how we can properly equip our young people to wrestle with the many contentious issues they are facing.\n\nDoug Stokes is Professor of International Security and Strategy in the Department of Politics at the University of Exeter. He specialises in US foreign policy, international security and debates on grand strategy. Professor Stokes has published a number of books, journal articles and book chapters in these areas including his most recent books; Global Energy Security and American Hegemony, (Johns Hopkins, 2011) US Foreign Policy (Oxford University Press, 2018). \n\nHis major developed research focus is on the durability of the US led liberal international order and the ways in which great powers can use military power to shape international relations in ways they deem desirable. This question becomes especially interesting in the context of economic power shifting to East Asia, the crisis of Western strategic agency and complex forms of global interdependence in a world of many states.

The division into East and West Germany reflected the division of the world into two during the Cold War. The East-West conflict was to last over 40 years.\n\nFrom today's point of view, what happened back then seems logical. Today we also know that the German-German divide lasted a long time, but it was not irreversible. And it seems almost inevitable that the democratic values of the West German constitution 1949 would prevail as the basis of society - including in the reunified Germany. But the Germans in 1949 couldn't even have guessed at all this. They were experiencing an unprecedented historical experiment in both East and West. It was a radically new situation: What if they made fundamental mistakes in the founding of their states? What if they were unable to overcome the curse of fascism? The documentary not only reconstructs the major events surrounding the founding of the two states in 1949, but also attitudes to life at the time. We meet contemporary witnesses from both countries who talk about embarking on a political and social journey, the course and destination of which were still quite open at that time.\n_______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Most people don't realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. I explain how this can be accomplished with non-exercise movements such as fidgeting to burn thousands of calories of fat a day-- a practice is rarely discussed but very well supported by the science literature. I also discuss an optimal fat loss protocol using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of exercise impact fat loss. I discuss if exercising fasted indeed increases fat oxidation-- it turns out the type and duration of exercise really matters. And I discuss the use of caffeine, GLP1 from Mate or guayusa and emerging new prescription compounds for fat loss. The episode includes a lot of tools, links to cost-free resources and explanation of the science underlying each tool for fat loss.\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - ", "date": "May 24, 2021", "views": "824,773 views", "comments": "2,089", "likes": "24,019 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6833.781, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6QmhrtBTO0": {"title": "Footnote * from How to Become Pope", "content creator": "CGP Grey", "description": "From How to Become Pope: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF8I_r...", "date": "Feb 4, 2019", "views": "1,565,688 views", "comments": "656", "likes": "37,118 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 25.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6QmhrtBTO0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vZ6EhDT3o": {"title": "l'Outlander - Willpower \ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f [lofi hip hop/relaxing beats]", "content creator": "Lofi Girl", "description": "\ud83d\udcbf| Listen everywhere\n\u2192 https://fanlink.to/Willpower", "date": "Feb 20, 2022", "views": "63,552 views", "comments": "178", "likes": "2,871 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1218.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vZ6EhDT3o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGVtJI_XPuQ": {"title": "Bungie REMOVED Thrallway XP farming!", "content creator": "Sweatcicle Clips", "description": "#Destiny2 #sweatcicle \nBungie REMOVED Thrallway XP farming!\nLIVE ON TWITCH: http://twitch.tv/sweatcicle", "date": "Feb 18, 2022", "views": "2,157 views", "comments": "11", "likes": "70 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 36.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGVtJI_XPuQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htFqgSKU-pY": {"title": "Clearing An Alien Planet Of Waste ~ The Gunk", "content creator": "Grillmastah", "description": "Use your trusty Power Glove to reverse the corruption, uncover secrets of old and heal the planet!

Also, you'll see the working hours of Japan factory workers.  We follow the factor owner, Sho, from morning until evening to see what his Japan work day and work life in tokyo is like as well as how he spends his time before and after work.  He has a 10 minute commute to his Japanese office, which is in the factory itself.  I hope you enjoy his day and the Japanese work culture in this video.  \n\n150 years ago, from the Meiji Period Japanese used sliced bread to make panko, a Japanese word PAN meaning bread, and KO meaning powder.  Japanese chefs started using sliced bread as a cheaper ingredient than overseas bread crumbs commonly made from crushed biscuits or crackers.  \n\nSho is a 3rd generation owner of the NAKAYA PANKO FACTORY a family-run business started in 1948 by his grandfather. It\u2019s the only truly Made-in-Tokyo Panko factory, as they are the only ones who bake their own bread in factory to create their panko, a flaky bread crumb commonly used as the crunchy coating in fried Japanese food.

He had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including \"'Round Midnight\", \"Blue Monk\", \"Straight, No Chaser\", \"Ruby, My Dear\", \"In Walked Bud\", and \"Well, You Needn't\". Monk is the second-most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington.\n\nMonk's compositions and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic twists and are consistent with his unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations.\n\nMonk was renowned for a distinct look which included suits, hats, and sunglasses. He was also noted for an idiosyncratic habit during performances: while other musicians continued playing, Monk would stop, stand up, and dance for a few moments before returning to the piano.\n\nMonk is one of five jazz musicians to have been featured on the cover of Time magazine (the others being Louis Armstrong, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington and Wynton Marsalis)\n\n\ud83d\udd34 WebSite: ", "date": "Sep 28, 2015", "views": "4,885,919 views", "comments": "1,554", "likes": "42,491 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2811.841, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icFRHJ9VZaw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ItwbAZ00-M": {"title": "Tin Noses: How Plastic Surgery Got it's Start", "content creator": "Into the Shadows", "description": "Just be happy you live modern times.. with modern medicine.\nGot a beard?

I've given that some careful consideration. You protesters have accomplished an awful lot already. The conservative leadership has crumbled. Erin O'Toole has been replaced by someone who is giving a fair bit of voice to your concerns.\n\nAll the people you represent have a voice in the house of commons. You have four provinces that have moved quite precipitously in the direction that the protest was hoping for. They are starting to lift mask mandates on something approximating as reasonable a timeline as might be expected under the circumstances. You're now faced with a difficult choice: what are your criteria for satisfaction.\n\nYou need to determine that so that you can negotiate with the necessary people. You're also faced with another danger at the moment, now that which is that the political process bent in the direction that you've insisted upon - rightly, in my estimation. This, more and more of you who are most reasonable are going to pack up and leave, or decide that this is done sometime over the next week or so (or a couple of weeks: that's obviously up to you) --, but there'll be a remnant that's much more committed in some sense to more extreme goals. That's going to be something very difficult to manage.\n\nI'd like to commend all of you for your diligence and work -- on accomplishing what you have accomplished under trying conditions -- and also for keeping your heads in a way that's been a model for the entire world. You've been able to remain peaceful. You haven't taken the bait. You haven't responded with violence to quite remarkable denigration and provocation. That's a sign of tremendous discipline and care. It's going to get more difficult to maintain as this goes along. So I hope that you're all able to allow a sufficient victory to be sufficient, to move forward without greed -- to be grateful for the effect that you've already had, and the support you've received, to move forward to a normative peace and the re-establishment of our country's economy and our psychological and social wellbeing. That's pretty much all I have to say at this point.

Ford F-250 Only 139 Original Miles. Barn Find. Insane Story", "content creator": "AMMO NYC", "description": "This is a 1978 Ford F-250 Lariat edition that is receiving its first wash in 42 years after sitting in a barn in North Carolina. This Ford truck has 139 original and has been lost on a farm for 42 years after 1 quick drive in later 1978. By disaster detail standards, this is brand new. Untouched. The owner drove it once to drive his daughter to work in the snow...then put it back in the barn. The F-250 is the lowest miles Ford Pickup Truck in the world. I performed a \"preservation detail\" to keep the condition authentic to the day it was picked up from the dealership. After a proper car wash and light polish, I added AMMO Skin paint sealant instead of a paint coating (AMMO Reflex Pro) to allow the new owner flexibility in how they choose to protect the paint in the future. The before and after is wildly satisfying and the final result is amazing. For a full list of products visit www.ammonyc.com.

He quit flying shortly after with only 80 hours total time logged.  On this \"Commercial Charter\" flight Doug White is flying home after attending his brother's funeral with his wife and daughters on board.  The Charter Pilot dies suddenly within minutes after takeoff.  Doug is forced to take control of the complex high performance turboprop aircraft with zero experience in a King Air and with zero notice.  Dead pilot slumped over the controls and distraught family in the passenger cabin.  If you are in anyway offended by these circumstances please do not watch this video.  ***END OF DISCLAIMER*** .  Previously released in 2015, this new edition includes new content, behind scenes information, interviews with air traffic controllers, super-titles of ATC communications, and more.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, April 12th, 2009, Doug White and his family chartered a Beech King Air B200 N559DW for a flight from Marco Island, Florida bound for Louisiana with 5 souls on board.  Soon after takeoff, the pilot, 67 year old retired Air Force Colonel Joe Cabuk  loses consciousness. creating an emergency situation that required extraordinary measures  by the planes passengers and Air Traffic Controllers.  This video is a recreation of that flight and is intended to honor and pay tribute to the pilots and air traffic controllers.\n\nI have used actual published radar tracks and numerous published interviews and news reports to determine as close as possible the flight path, altitudes, headings, and other pertinent details of this flight.  Due to a relatively erratic flight path following the emergency, some airspeeds, altitudes, and headings, may vary slightly from the actual flight.  The actual ATC recording of the communications with the King Air are included in their entirety.  \n\nYouTube Audio Library Music:  \"Under Cover\" by Wayne Jones.  \"Progressive Moments\" by Ugonna Onyekwe.\n\nThe King Air used for this flight is by Carenado.

Its people are in lockdown while frontline services wage war against the pandemic. \n \nWith over fourteen thousand dead, New York City accounts for around one third of all corona-related deaths in the US.  \n \nEvery day, there are hundreds of new infections and deaths. The city\u2019s hospitals are overflowing, health workers lack medical and protective equipment and morgues have run out of space. \n \nForeign Correspondent\u2019s reporter Karishma Vyas, a New York resident, goes behind the lines of the city\u2019s battle to slow infections, save lives, protect its vulnerable and bury the dead. \n \nWe follow paramedics as they respond to emergency house calls, helping desperate families. We discover many who die of COVID-19 don\u2019t make the official death toll.   \n \nWe film with the police union as they hand out desperately needed personal safety equipment to their officers. \n \n\u201cI thought I\u2019d seen it all on September 11th, but I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. We\u2019re anticipating this getting even worse. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to get this equipment out to our guys\u201d, says a Union officer.  \n \nWe speak with an ICU nurse who\u2019s travelled from out of state to lend a hand in a Bronx hospital. He tells us about working double shifts, often with no break, and the pressure of looking after multiple critically ill patients at the same time. A good day is when none of his patients die. \n \nOne overworked doctor describes his frustration with the US health system. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve had people come in barely breathing and their first question isn\u2019t \u2018Am I going to survive?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018How is this going to impact my family financially?\u2019\u201d \n \n\u201cThis illness exposes all the fault-lines throughout American society\u201d, says the doctor. \n \nAnd we catch up with characters who embody the city\u2019s spirit of defiance and survival. \n \n\u201cI want to be remembered as someone who never left the frontlines and who was essential\u201d, says the Naked Cowboy, a performer whose stage is Times Square \u2013 rain, hail or coronavirus.  \n \nThis is an intimate and powerful portrait of a city in crisis.  \n\n\nAbout Foreign Correspondent: \nForeign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

The aim may be worthy but the means are faulty. The problem is that you do not spend someone else's money as carefully as your own. More to the point, it's impossible to \"do good\" with someone else's money without first taking it away from someone else. That implies coercion--the use of bad means to corrupt the good ends of the welfare state. Welfare programs implicitly encourage competition for government funds and create unfortunate divisions and antagonisms in our society that erode individual freedom.

The event garnered national and international attention from The Times of London, NPR, BBC, Christian Post, and Fox News Network. Spectator Magazine called the debate remarkable, and still others have called it historic.\n\nThe God Delusion Debate was filmed on October 3, 2007 before a sold-out crowd at the University of Alabama-Birmingham's Alys Stephens Center and broadcast to a global audience of over one million.\n\nFree study guide at ", "date": "Feb 8, 2017", "views": "1,330,582 views", "comments": "13,101", "likes": "15,912 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6399.781, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5bPI92-5o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-x8DYTOv7w": {"title": "YouTubers have to declare ads.

We are currently on a winter road trip across the united states working on investigating cold cases. This was a case we took on searching for a missing mother STEPHANIE TORRES who disappeared in the middle of the night four years ago without a trace. \n\nThis is a behind the scenes account of working with Fire, Police, News, Towing, and Local Agencies in the SOLVED Case of Stephanie Torres. This documentary style video is told by the perspective of Team Member and Videographer Josh Cantu.\n\nStephanie was last seen December of 2017.\nFilmed in Waco Texas on January 19, 2022.\n\nAt that time a local investigation was opened but with the lack of evidence or leads the case quickly went cold. However when Adventures with Purpose took the case they brought a very valuable asset to the mix - experience in solving the thought to be UNSOLVEABLE cases. With some simple information from the family on Stephanie's last known location and her typical daily habits we were able to narrow down the search to on HIGHLY PROBABLE location: the local  boat ramp near her house. Within one hour of searching three vehicles were found and dove upon, and one of them MATCHED the description of Stephanies Car. However since new Texas License Plates are made of paper not metal we were unable to be 100% sure this was the missing mother. The only way to know for sure would prove to be pulling the vehicle out of the water. \n\nFull Video by AWP:  ", "date": "Feb 10, 2022", "views": "536,255 views", "comments": "679", "likes": "9,226 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1768.561, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe3ApJ9SJN8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctByXhte_-A": {"title": "[1352] I Got Rick-Rolled Via Mail (Locking USB Drive)", "content creator": "LockPickingLawyer", "description": "https://www.covertinstruments.com\n\nThe referenced video:  [1324] Did You Think I Was Dumb?

Several centuries ago, the greatest threat the galaxy has ever known emerged in the form of the dark Sith Empire. After a volatile war, the Republic emerged victorious and the Sith were assumed to be extinct. Nonetheless, the Jedi have maintained a constant vigil over the ancient Sith homeworld, to protect the galaxy from the darkness that still resides in the planet's tombs.\n\nThe Battle of Alderaan. The Republic's gravest hour. Recently promoted to Darth, Malgus launches the first of many surprise attacks that would become his trademark during the Great War, perfectly timing the assault with a feint that pulls the Republic fleet light-years away. Thousands of assault droids and hundreds of Sith set the heart of the Republic ablaze, and Alderaan's few defenders are swept away with ease. Unknown to Darth Malgus, small groups of Republic Troopers are stationed on Alderaan, some recovering from wounds, others are awaiting orders. As these brave soldiers take to the forests and mountains to fight a guerilla campaign against Malgus's forces, the Republic fleet rushes back to repel the invasion. With time running out and Alderaan's capitol threatened, it falls to Havoc Squad, the elite Republic Special Forces unit, to coordinate one last desperate stand against Malgus' vastly superior numbers.\n\nBattle to take control and rule the galaxy in the upcoming STAR WARS The Old Republic Digital Expansion - Knights of the Eternal Throne. Face powerful factions, influence the galaxy for the light or dark side of the Force, and decide who lives and dies in your own STAR WARS story.\n\nIn this prequel trailer to the STAR WARS The Old Republic Knights of the Fallen Empire Digital Expansion we introduce you to the tragic destiny of twin heirs caught in a web of evil and manipulation spun for them by the darkest and most powerful Emperor yet to threaten the galaxy.

Constructing Japanese homes in Tokyo can be a complicated process, so it's common for Japanese living in Tokyo and Japanese living in Japan to ask a professional home building company like like Daiwa House to help manage and construct their home.  We follow Yuya from morning until evening and throughout his workday to show the Japanese working culture and construction culture in Japan.  Construction workers in Japan have their own unique routines and process when building a house in Japan and this a peek into their daily lives in Tokyo.  Japan is also ranked 4th in the world for having earthquakes so earthquake resistant building construction laws have been in place since 1924 and have been updated over the years, such as the shin-taishin standard, requiring that all buildings must be able to withstand a stage 6 seismic event on Japan\u2019s 7-stage seismic scale.  \n\nYuya is a Ni-Kyu Kenchikushi, a prefecture license certified second-class architect which allows him to manage small housing construction.  A first class license would allow for larger construction projects such as olympic stadiums but would require passing a national qualifying exam available to four year university graduates with a minimum 2 years of practical building related experience, where only about 10% of the applicants are able to pass.

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

The most high profile trials were the Nuremberg Trials, that brought Hitler's remaining inner circle and Nazi government in front of judges to face up to the crimes committed. But there were also a number of other trials that took place to ensure that the guards who committed barbaric crimes at specific concentration camps were punished. One set of trials that took place was the Stutthof Trials, which were called to bring the guards and staff who worked at Stutthof Concentration Camp to justice.\n\nIt was a camp where much horror occurred within the barbed wire fences. Dozens of thousands of prisoners died at Stutthof through beatings, executions, starvation and mass killings. Thousands more died on the death marches and many were shot after being force marched into the sea. Stutthof was a barbaric camp, and during the post-war trials, what shocked many was that a number of the defendants who faced the first trial were young women, young women accused of such brutality and murder with their own hands. These women were, Jenny Wanda Barkmann, Elisabeth Becker, Wanda Klaff, Ewa Paradies and Gerda Steinhoff. \n\nAll of these women were accused of crimes against humanity, and they were sentenced to death. They were taken to a hill outside of Gdansk, and on there stood a number of huge gallows. The women were placed onto trucks and then the executioner placed a noose around their neck, when the trucks drove off they were killed. There was a huge crowd of around 200,000 people who came to see the proceedings that day. \n\nSo join us today as we look at, 'The JUSTIFIED Execution Of The Female Guards Of Stutthof.'  \n\nThanks for watching!

He lay under the wheel of a car and completely helpless... He lay on the grass for a long time, hot during the day, cold at night. He was in a lot of pain and had nothing to eat. He lay on the roadside for more than 2 days. No one helped. He was tired and slept all the time... Izum thought it was time to say goodbye to this world. A little soul is helped. And a miracle happened!! He felt someone hugging him!!! The baby has been helped!!! Izum even pees out of happiness.. We're taking Izum to Vet. His spine was completely broken. He had immediate surgery. Izum is about 3.4 months old. There's still a lifetime to go. That's why it takes effort to make him run. Because of spinal cord injury 90% of people are disabled, unable to walk. We put a metal structure on his spine to help keep his trauma to a minimum. Izum was well fed, slept on warm towels, raised and cared for with great care. Every day this little angel needs foot massage and muscle development. But Izum is very active, vibrant, Izum will run to anywhere.

Some of the wealthiest landowners including Jeff Bezos, John Malone and Thomas Peterffy are buying up forests, ranches and farmlands across the United States. Why? Watch the video to find out.\n\nInvestments in farmland are growing across the country as people, including the ultra-wealthy like Bill Gates, look for new ways to grow their money.\n\nIn 2020, Gates made headlines for becoming the largest private farmland owner in the U.S. He had accumulated more than 269,000 acres of farmland across 18 states in less than a decade. His farmland grows onions, carrots and even the potatoes that are used to make McDonald\u2019s French fries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an asset with increasing value,\u201d American Farmland Trust CEO John Piotti said. \u201cIt has great intrinsic value and beyond that, it is a limited resource.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 30% of all farmland is owned by landlords who don\u2019t farm themselves. Buyers often purchase land from farmers who have owned it for decades; many of whom may be asset rich but maybe cash poor.\n\n\u201cThe economic realities for them are typical that they\u2019ve spent their life farming,\u201d said Holly Rippon-Butler, land campaign director at the National Young Farmers Coalition. \u201cTheir retirement, their equity is all in the land and tied up in selling land.\u201d\n\nPrivate landowners are also making a profit by utilizing the land in numerous ways. Approximately 39% of the 911 million acres of farmland across the U.S. is rented out to farmers, and 80% of that rented farmland is owned by landlords who don\u2019t farm themselves data from the Agriculture Department shows.\n\n\u201cThe young farmers are just as happy to lease the land because whether you are young or old, it\u2019s a business, right?\u201d said Thomas Petterfy, chairman of Interactive Brokers and owner of 581,000 acres.\n\n\u201cYou go buy a farm and you put that cash rental lease in place, you\u2019re going to be looking at about 2.5% return on your capital,\u201d Peoples Company President Steve Bruere said.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: ", "date": "Aug 21, 2021", "views": "3,608,530 views", "comments": "11,834", "likes": "35,847 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 793.081, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJVL9HegCr4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUH4RzAofv8": {"title": "Christopher HItchens on Firing Line with William F.

Support our work: https://www.chop.edu/addy-and-lily\n\nConjoined twins Addison (Addy) and Lilianna (Lily) Altobelli were successfully separated by surgeons at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) on October 13, 2021. The girls were born connected at the abdomen and chest, a condition known as thoraco-omphalopagus twins, meaning they shared a liver, diaphragm, chest and abdominal wall. \n\nAddy and Lily\u2019s journey began when they were diagnosed prenatally at their 20-week ultrasound. Before that appointment, parents Maggie and Dom Altobelli had assumed they were having one baby, but the ultrasound image showed that not only was Maggie carrying two fetuses but they were also attached at the abdomen. \n\nConjoined twins are rare, occurring in only about 1 in 50,000 births. The couple was referred to CHOP for further evaluation, since the hospital is one of only a few in the country with experience separating conjoined twins. More than 28 pairs of conjoined twins have been separated at CHOP since 1957, the most of any hospital in the country.\n\nThe couple met with specialists in CHOP\u2019s Richard D. Wood Jr. Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment. Doctors discovered that although the girls shared a chest and abdominal wall, diaphragm, and liver, the twins had separate, healthy hearts. Their shared liver was also large enough to divide between them, making them excellent candidates for separation surgery.\n\nAfter months of planning for a high-risk delivery via C-section, led by Julie S. Moldenhauer, MD, Addy and Lily were born on November 18, 2020, in the Garbose Family Special Delivery Unit (SDU), CHOP\u2019s inpatient delivery unit. They spent four months in the Newborn/Infant Intensive Care Unit (N/IICU), followed by six months in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). CHOP plastic surgeon David W. Low, MD, inserted skin expanders to stretch the girls\u2019 skin in preparation for separation surgery. Like small, collapsible balloons, the skin expanders gradually expand through injections, stretching the skin slowly over time so each girl would have enough skin to cover her exposed chest wall and abdomen after separation. \n\nOn October 13, 2021, after months of preparation, Addy and Lily underwent a 10-hour surgery and were officially separated at 2:38 p.m. The surgical team, led by Holly Hedrick, MD, included more than two dozen specialists, including general surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists, a cardiothoracic surgeon, and plastic surgeons. Once the twins had been separated, the surgical team rebuilt each girl\u2019s chest and abdominal wall. Stephanie Fuller, MD, a cardiothoracic surgeon, ligated the girls\u2019 patent ductus arteriosus and made sure both girls\u2019 hearts were in the right position and functioning well. Plastic surgeons placed two layers of mesh \u2013 one temporary, one permanent \u2013 over the twins\u2019 abdominal and chest walls and then covered that with the skin that had been stretched over months.  \n\nOn December 1, 2021, the Altobellis finally flew home to Chicago \u2013 one twin at a time, with one parent each \u2013 after living in Philadelphia for more than a year. The twins spent two weeks at Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital under the care of the medical team that will support them closer to home. The girls were discharged just in time for Christmas and arrived home to find their yard decorated by their neighbors. They spent the holiday together at home as a family of four.\n\nThis video is unscripted. Interviews were shot at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and in Chicago, Illinois.

Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. \n\nSowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. \n\nThey chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. \n\nSowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more. \n\nRelated Resources: \n\n\u2022 Discrimination and Disparities (", "date": "May 3, 2018", "views": "643,297 views", "comments": "389", "likes": "15,886 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2424.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7hmTRT8tb4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVdADcmBVLc": {"title": "2019 Male Tumbling World Championships Finals", "content creator": "Fluffington 69", "description": "SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE TUMBLING CONTENT", "date": "Dec 1, 2019", "views": "903,890 views", "comments": "450", "likes": "10,134 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 352.841, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVdADcmBVLc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwbzAuyf6aI": {"title": "Dan Bongino: This is the biggest crisis of them all", "content creator": "Fox News", "description": "'Unfiltered' host details a list of crises America faces and says truth is the biggest crisis of them all.\n#FoxNews #Bongino", "date": "Feb 19, 2022", "views": "980,861 views", "comments": "6,336", "likes": "43,903 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 510.601, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwbzAuyf6aI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR6dnnarYzE": {"title": "Brooke Shields\u2019s Guide to Skin Care in Your 50s and Less-Is-More Makeup | Beauty Secrets | Vogue", "content creator": "Vogue", "description": "56-year-old model-turned-actress Brooke Shields shares her everyday routine and reflects on how her beauty philosophy has changed over the years. \n\nFilmed at The Standard, High Line\n\nShop this beauty routine:\n\nTrue Botanicals Renew Nourishing Cleanser: ", "date": "Feb 9, 2022", "views": "792,982 views", "comments": "1,572", "likes": "27,311 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 684.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR6dnnarYzE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxEeYSusehc": {"title": "Thomas Sowell - The Origins of Woke", "content creator": "LibertyPen", "description": "In 1995, Thomas Sowell examined the elitist social movement that has now metastasized into Woke culture. http://www.LibertyPen.com", "date": "Jul 8, 2021", "views": "276,752 views", "comments": "1,275", "likes": "14,291 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 888.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxEeYSusehc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9omoNpix9sA": {"title": "America's Newsroom 2/18/22 [FULL] | Fox Breaking News Trump February 18, 2022", "content creator": "PoxPox", "description": "America's Newsroom    2/18/22 - America's Newsroom    full | Fox Breaking News Trump February 18, 2022\nAmerica's Newsroom    2/18/22 BIDEN resign\nAmerica's Newsroom    2/18/22 -  America's Newsroom    2/18/22 full Harris resign\nAmerica's Newsroom    2/18/22 -  America's Newsroom    2/18/22 full Pelosi resign\n\n America's Newsroom   2/18/22,breaking fox news today 18 feb,2022,America's Newsroom   2/18/22,fox and friend,America's Newsroom   live,animated variety series,Stephen Colbert,Chris Licht,RJ Fried,fox news live,America's Newsroom   2/18/22 full episode,Trump Latest News,America's Newsroom   live,America's Newsroom   Today,Breaking News,Fox u0026 Friends 2/18/22,fox breaking trump news,fox news live stream,fox news network,fox news media,february 18\n\nThanks for Watching\nPlease Like video & Subcribe channel !

Robot eventually returned but the next day, Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole.\n\nAnd after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a wooly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave. It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nGerman Channel: ", "date": "May 24, 2020", "views": "7,549,693 views", "comments": "14,488", "likes": "453,540 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 509.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgnlkJPga4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yutzg2NLwcU": {"title": "Giant Aircraft: Manufacturing an Airbus A350 | Mega Manufacturing | Free Documentary", "content creator": "Free Documentary", "description": "Mega Manufacturing: Airbus A350 | 4K Engineering Documentary\n\nAssembled in France using millions of components made throughout Europe: The A350 is the most modern commercial aircraft in the world. \n\nThe Airbus A 350: the most modern commercial aircraft in the world. It takes 1800 highly-skilled specialists in Toulouse, France, and 2.5 million individual parts, delivered from all over the world, to assemble this masterpiece of aeronautic engineering. The goal: An aircraft with minimal consumption and maximum range. 53 percent of the Aircraft consist of a modern ultra-light composite material. But the innovative material also requires entirely new manufacturing processes. A challenge for the aircraft manufacturers in Toulouse. And the final assembly is preceded by a logistical masterpiece: The individual parts of the aircraft travel from various Airbus plants in Europe to Toulouse: the front and centre sections from Saint-Nazaire in France, the tail section from Hamburg, the wings from Broughton in Wales and Bremen, and the tail fin from Getafe in Spain. The factory in Toulouse is supplied with these parts by a specially developed transport aircraft, the Beluga. Several times a day, five of these machines commute between the various plants and bring supplies for production seven days a week from early in the morning until midnight. And the journey of the components is not over in Toulouse. By the time the A350 is fully assembled it will have passed through seven hangars or \"stations.\" Given the extremely high number of components that have to be assembled and the large number of different suppliers, there are a lot of risk factors involved in the production of the A350. And the pressure is high: The modern aircraft is extremely popular with airlines, with 890 pending orders to date. Ten aircraft of the A350 have to leave the factory every month no matter what. \n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: ", "date": "Dec 8, 2019", "views": "7,111,257 views", "comments": "2,077", "likes": "48,880 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2894.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yutzg2NLwcU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AI-m0rhZG8": {"title": "Luke's Entrance but with the Force Theme", "content creator": "Live Breathe Media", "description": "For those asking what the tracks are:\nThe first theme is the Force Awakens trailer music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8--h...", "date": "Feb 4, 2021", "views": "31,762,938 views", "comments": "38,527", "likes": "500,419 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 272.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AI-m0rhZG8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyMsrgI7-_s": {"title": "Why do Chinese Billionaires Keep Disappearing?", "content creator": "Jake Tran", "description": "Healthy cereal that tastes too good to be true: Get $5 OFF with code JAKETRAN at https://magicspoon.com/jaketran \n\n\ud83d\ude08 Watch exclusive 40+ minute documentaries that are too controversial to ever be released to the public: ", "date": "Jan 20, 2021", "views": "1,987,516 views", "comments": "8,829", "likes": "74,980 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1306.961, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyMsrgI7-_s"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbnco_8lE8": {"title": "danny gonzalez out of context for 3 minutes (with kurtis)", "content creator": "smile's CLIPS", "description": "none of these clips are owned by me\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/Danny100\n^^^^go join greg and sub to danny ^^^^", "date": "Jan 29, 2022", "views": "16,763 views", "comments": "53", "likes": "1,332 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 187.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbnco_8lE8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9kL0W4E7-o": {"title": "Paul McCartney talking about Yoko ! 1980s | #thebeatles #fyp", "content creator": "Marcelo Durham", "description": "Is he being true or political .. ?

In theaters July 1, 2022.\n\nIn the heart of the 1970s, amid a flurry of feathered hair and flared jeans, Gru (Oscar\u00ae nominee Steve Carell) is growing up in the suburbs. A fanboy of a supervillain supergroup known as the Vicious 6, Gru hatches a plan to become evil enough to join them. Luckily, he gets some mayhem-making backup from his loyal followers, the Minions. Together, Kevin, Stuart, Bob, and Otto - a new Minion sporting braces and a desperate need to please - deploy their skills as they and Gru build their first lair, experiment with their first weapons and pull off their first missions. When the Vicious 6 oust their leader, legendary fighter Wild Knuckles (Oscar\u00ae winner Alan Arkin), Gru interviews to become their newest member. It doesn\u2019t go well (to say the least), and only gets worse after Gru outsmarts them and suddenly finds himself the mortal enemy of the apex of evil. On the run, Gru will turn to an unlikely source for guidance, Wild Knuckles himself, and discover that even bad guys need a little help from their friends. \n\n\u00a9 Universal Pictures", "date": "Feb 2, 2022", "views": "11,854,507 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x009CFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x009677F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00862E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0088E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0088E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008B9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008A7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008B75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008A7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008836B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00884546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00B69622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00C1882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00A623E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00A61443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0096D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00971518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00971660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0097B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x757C6359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x774E87A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x774E8774+180]\n", "likes": "43,208 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 83.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-zEigjPtKo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vxlu98iLAI": {"title": "Every college film bro", "content creator": "Dark_Ranger", "description": "yes those are my posters yes I'm a college film student", "date": "Jun 15, 2021", "views": "2,526 views", "comments": "12", "likes": "88 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5.281, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vxlu98iLAI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lre-OpA-utU": {"title": "Joe Rogan & David Goggins - Listening to Music While Working Out is Cheating", "content creator": "JRE Clips", "description": "Taken from Joe Rogan Experience #1212:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvWB7...", "date": "Dec 5, 2018", "views": "3,135,179 views", "comments": "7,469", "likes": "75,772 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 333.541, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lre-OpA-utU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jENn5Ys7vDE": {"title": "Most Expensive Cars of Football Players", "content creator": "KickFlix", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo isn't the only football player spending millions..\nPlayers like Lionel Messi, Neymar, Aubameyang & more joined in on the car collecting fun..

Dent\u2019s Demographic Cliff and Global Economic Collapse\uff5cHarry S. Dent, Jr.\uff5cWKF 2015", "content creator": "World Knowledge Forum", "description": "* Harry Dent\u2019s Demographic Cliff and Global Economic Collapse: Demographic shock of aging population and population decline in advanced countries is threatening the entire world today. World renowned futurist Harry Dent, who successfully predicted the 1980 Japan bubble burst and the 1990 boom of US economy, warns us that the demographic shift will negatively affect the global economy in his book of . According to him, demographic cliff of declining population will result in reduced consumption and lack of aggregate demand, thereby causing economic recession across the world. Korea is not an exception. According to Statistics Korea, the percentage of people over the age of 65 will increase from 13 percent to 30 percent by 2060. And KDI (Korea Development Institute) forecasts the economic growth rate will fall to 2 percent by 2020 and 1 percent by 2030 because of population aging. The worst case scenario is that low growth trend will be entrenched due to rapidly declining labor force participation rate resulting from a decline in population and aging. This is the reason why we should prepare preemptive measures to tackle the issues of population decline and aging. On the other hand, North Korea has relatively younger population structure, which can complement dwindling labor force of South Korea. In this session, there will be a heated debate on whether all the countries around the world including Korea will fall to a demographic cliff as Harry Dent forecasted or overcome this phenomenon and sustain economic growth.\n\n- If the Demographic Cliff becomes a reality, how will this affect the global economy? What would be the impact of global demographic trend on sustainable development and climate change?\n- What measures must nation states take in order to alleviate the effects of The Demographic Cliff?\n- What measures should Korean government take in response to the aging population and population decline?\n- What are the implications of the North Korean population structure which is younger than that of the South Korea?\n- Can we solve the aging population issue in Korea by opening the doors for immigration?\n\n\u2605 WKF \u2192 ", "date": "May 28, 2020", "views": "74,255 views", "comments": "317", "likes": "1,337 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1195.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YMqgAmlefw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5N67YxkxbQ": {"title": "| Oversimplified | 1 minute and 50 seconds of people saying Oh No to their situations", "content creator": "Spidey", "description": "aw sheet here we go again\n\nYou voted, you get it.

I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shapes our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.", "date": "Mar 29, 2021", "views": "395,789 views", "comments": "1,004", "likes": "11,425 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6061.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXIioO4Wn5U": {"title": "Change Your INNER PROGRAMMING With a Powerful BEDTIME ROUTINE! | Bruce Lipton | Top 10 Rules", "content creator": "Evan Carmichael", "description": "\u270e Get free access to our vault of PDF summaries for every YouTube video here: https://believe.evancarmichael.com/th...", "date": "Feb 19, 2022", "views": "27,392 views", "comments": "63", "likes": "975 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5231.161, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXIioO4Wn5U"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FPtxqdtoHg": {"title": "10 Extreme Dangerous Fastest Logging Wood Truck Operator, Heavy Equipment Chainsaw & Sawmill Machine", "content creator": "Secret Machinery", "description": "10 Extreme Dangerous Fastest Logging Wood Truck Operator, Heavy Equipment Chainsaw & Sawmill Machine", "date": "Jun 6, 2021", "views": "39,207,762 views", "comments": "1,920", "likes": "80,940 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 939.281, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FPtxqdtoHg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP6iyVJ70OU": {"title": "Is The Wave Function The Building Block of Reality?", "content creator": "PBS Space Time", "description": "Thank you to Wren for supporting PBS.

The administrative capital of Switzerland is Bern, and Lausanne serves as its judicial center. Switzerland borders Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. It is geographically divided between the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura. These cities host offices of several international organizations such as the WTO, WHO, ILO, the seat of the International Olympic Committee, the headquarters of FIFA, the second largest office of the United Nations, as well as the main building of the Bank. for international payments. Most animals in Switzerland live in the mountains. The ibex, a species of mountain goat, was almost completely extirpated in the early 1800s. The species has since been reintroduced and there are now over 15,000 ibex in the Swiss Alps. Four major European climates affect Switzerland. From the west, due to the North Atlantic drift, soft and humid air masses come; dry and cold air comes from the northern arctic regions; continental air from the east brings dry, cool air in winter and warmer air in summer; and relatively humid and warm air flows northward from the Mediterranean.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f Music for relaxation, meditation, study, reading, massage, spa or sleep.

Meanwhile, Taiwan looms in the distance\u2014with a population of almost 24 million, it\u2019s a technology hub and the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of microchips and other items essential to high tech. What are China\u2019s ambitions toward Taiwan? And if they are ominous, what should the US response to Chinese aggression be? To answer these questions, we\u2019re joined by two experts: former national security advisor (and current Hoover Institution senior fellow) H. R. McMaster and former US deputy national security advisor (and current Hoover distinguished visiting fellow) Matthew Pottinger. They also discuss the Biden administration\u2019s recent diplomatic encounters with China, and which countries might be allies in a conflict with China\u2014and which ones would not be. \n\nFor further information: ", "date": "Apr 13, 2021", "views": "627,029 views", "comments": "525", "likes": "9,633 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4462.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E12r-37GZI0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQNdZ8Lz1F8": {"title": "COVID-19: Calls grow to scrap on-arrival PCR test for travelers", "content creator": "Global News", "description": "Canadians returning home from trips abroad must show proof of a negative PCR COVID-19 test to re-enter the country.

We use techniques recommended by speech therapists. Join us as we learn about pets and animal sounds in this fun \u201cTalking Time\u201d video! After pets, you will see some of our farm animal video and then some slow speech exercises. We hope you find the toddler speech learning exercises, activities and techniques helpful. \n\nIf you think your child may have a speech delay, talk to your pediatrician. You may qualify for free speech therapy through early intervention. You can also get an assessment from a speech therapist. The sooner you get help, the better! \n\nJust to be clear, we ourselves are not speech therapists. Rachel has a masters in music education and teaches preschool music.  She has also taught many toddler classes. If you are in New York City and are seeking a speech therapist, check out www.chatterboxnyc.com The brilliant speech therapists at Chatterbox are highly recommended and helped with our \u201cSpeech Techniques for Toddlers\u201d video. \n\nWe also include toddler songs and baby songs in our toddler speech learning videos. Simple songs can help the development of language and gestures! Gestures and imitation are building blocks that help with language development. We also include some sign language and pretend play. Baby sign language can help with the development of language and will not impede the development of language and speech. We also model pretend play. Pretend play is an important toddler skill. \n\nIn this video we will go over the following animal sounds: Dog, cat, bunny rabbit and farm animals, cow, duck, pig, sheep and horse. Animal sounds are a great way to encourage your child to make sounds and experiment with their voice. A fun toy that may encourage language is a toy barn with toy farm animals. You can get right down on the floor at your child\u2019s level and make the animal sounds. It may help to hold a toy by your mouth so they look at the way your mouth produces the sounds.\n\nThis video may also be helpful to children with apraxia, autism, down syndrome and other developmental delays and special needs. We hope the speech activities, exercises, lessons and training are helpful! This video is great for a baby, 1 year old, 2 year old, 3 year old, 4 year old and even older! \n\nOn our channel, we have many more speech practice videos (see our speech playlist) and we also have free preschool class videos (see our preschool class playlist) and full music classes! We have videos for babies, videos for toddlers and videos for kids. Our videos for toddlers are in English. In our videos we work on speech and language, milestones, gestures, pretend play, social emotional learning, dramatic play, art, music, math, science, circle time, finger plays, sensory play and many more activities! We\u2019d love for you to become part of our Songs for Littles family! \n\nIf you are looking for videos for babies, 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds, 4 year olds or even 5 year olds, our videos will be excellent choices.

His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother was of Italian descent. He spoke only Italian until age five. Martin came up the hard way, with such jobs as a boxer (named Kid Crochet), a steel mill worker, a gas station worker and a casino croupier and dealer.\n\nIn 1946, he got his first ticket to stardom, as he teamed up with another hard worker who was also trying to succeed in Hollywood: Jerry Lewis. Films such as At War with the Army (1950) sent the team toward super-stardom. The duo were to become one of Hollywood's truly great teams. They lasted 11 years together, and starred in 16 movies. They were unstoppable, but personality conflicts broke up the team. Even without Lewis, Martin was a true superstar.\n\nFew thought that Martin would go on to achieve solo success, but he did, winning critical acclaim for his role in Gen\u00e7 Aslanlar (1958) with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift, and A\u015fk U\u011fruna (1958), with Shirley MacLaine and Frank Sinatra. Movies such as Kahramanlar \u015eehri (1959) brought him international fame. One of his best remembered films is in Soyguncular (1960), in which he played Sam Harmon alongside the other members of the legendary Rat Pack: Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford. Martin proved potent at the box office through the 1960s, with films such as Bells Are Ringing (1960) and 7 tatl\u0131 serseri (1964), again with Rat Pack pals Sammy Davis Jr. and Sinatra. During much of the 1960s and 1970s, Martin's movie persona of a boozing playboy prompted a series of films as secret agent Matt Helm and his own television variety show. Havaalan\u0131 (1970) followed, featuring Martin as a pilot. He also played a phony priest in Yolun sonu (1981).\n\nIn 1965, Martin explored a new method for entertaining his fans: Television. That year he hosted one of the most successful TV series in history: The Dean Martin Show (1965), which lasted until 1973. In 1965, it won a Golden Globe Award. In 1973, he renamed it \"The Dean Martin Comedy Hour\", and from 1974 to 1984 it was renamed again, this time \"The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts\". It became one of the most successful TV series in history, skewering such greats as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball, James Stewart, George Burns, Milton Berle, Don Rickles, Phyllis Diller and Joe Namath.\n\nHis last public role was a return to the stage, for a cross-country concert tour with Davis and Sinatra.

More recently, equality has come to mean equality of outcome. Equality of outcome cannot be mandated, cannot be insured. Any serious attempt to achieve it would destroy freedom.

Peterson. Jordan Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. \n\n\n\n\n\nPsychology professor Jordan Peterson has become a controversial figure ever since speaking out against Bill C-16 (2016), a law that adds gender expression and gender identity to the Canadian Human Rights Act. \n\n\n\nHe has received both praise and criticism after the publication of his self-help book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018). His fans are thankful for the advice he\u2019s given them to take responsibility for their lives. Peterson has become an important inspiration for various men\u2019s groups, an influential voice.\n\n\n\n\nJordan Peterson gives an EXTREMELY POWERFUL motivational speech on becoming unstoppable in life, showing you the steps we need to take in order to achieve your true potential. If you enjoyed the wonderful life advice, be sure to support Jordan Peterson himself and purchase his latest book, it's a great read!\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 FOOTAGE licensed through VideoBlocks, Filmpac and Artgrid except parts about the topic that have been used under fair use.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 BACKGROUND MUSIC licensed through Audio Jungle\n\n\ud83c\udfb6Music: Free Audio Library- No Copyright Music\n\n\n\n\n\u25baFAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER\n\n* Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

I first wanted to put more ''happy'' music at the beginning and transition to more ''darker'' themed music at the end like the forest in the video.

Based on research on the psychology of leadership, Chamorro-Premuzic shows that if leaders were selected on competence rather than confidence, humility rather than charisma, and integrity rather than narcissism, we would not just end up with more competent leaders, but also more women leaders. In fact, he argues, the main obstacle preventing competent women from becoming leaders is the lack of career obstacles for incompetent men.  Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic is an international authority in psychological profiling, talent management, leadership development, and people analytics. He is the Chief Talent Scientist at Manpower Group, co-founder and CEO of DeeperSignals and Metaprofiling, and Professor of Business Psychology at both University College London, and Columbia University. He has previously held academic positions at New York University and the London School of Economics, and lectured at Harvard Business School, Stanford Business School, London Business School, Johns Hopkins, IMD, and INSEAD, as well as being the CEO at Hogan Assessment Systems. Dr. Tomas has published 10 books and over 150 scientific papers, making him one of the most prolific social scientists of his generation. His work has received awards by the American Psychological Association and the Society for Industrial-Organizational Psychology, to which he is a Fellow. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Including JJ Abrams, Kathleen Kennedy, George Lucas, Rian Johnson, and many fans!  \n\nThe sequel trilogy is the third installment of films of the Star Wars saga to be produced. It begins thirty years after the ending of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi and focuses around a conflict between the First Order, a military state and successor to the Galactic Empire, and the Resistance, a military group formed to oppose the First Order and successor to the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\n\nThe films are produced by Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, with Bad Robot Productions having also helped produce The Force Awakens. The trilogy features the return of classic Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Darth Sidious as well as a host of new characters, primarily focusing on the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey, the deserter First Order stormtrooper Finn and Kylo Ren, the son of Leia Organa and Han Solo who is the master of the Knights of Ren and who had fallen into the dark side of the Force.\n\nRumors of a sequel trilogy had been talked about for decades, ever since George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, stated that he had plans for films that would take place after the original Star Wars trilogy. As the canon saga developed, however, Lucas denied that a sequel trilogy would ever be made, stating that Star Wars was the story of Anakin Skywalker and that his story ended in Return of the Jedi. The development of the sequel trilogy was made official on October 30, 2012, when The Walt Disney Company announced that it was acquiring Lucasfilm from Lucas and that they would be producing new Star Wars films beginning in 2015.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO OVERLORD DVD (Doomcock) FOR NARRATING THIS FOR US, GO GIVE HIM A SUB:  ", "date": "Jan 18, 2020", "views": "250,829 views", "comments": "3,687", "likes": "7,800 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4809.161, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJONGbOTVc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8qJ1hLe_fE": {"title": "a typical family in a horror movie", "content creator": "Nick Wilkins", "description": "#shorts", "date": "Feb 18, 2022", "views": "2,171 views", "comments": "4", "likes": "130 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 15.061, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8qJ1hLe_fE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdFudLPyqng": {"title": "Dancing Jerusalema all over the World 30min mix", "content creator": "Rob Bulder", "description": "The whole world is dancing on Jerusalema.

FULL MOVIE", "content creator": "Star Wars Theory", "description": "Welcome to this full fan fiction, completed with part 2 picking up right where we left off in last week's part 1.\n\nAs Mace moved with Kenobi to attack Palpatine, Yoda quickly turned to push the clones so hard into the wall behind them, that they broke through the wall itself. He used the force to break the door to Palpatine\u2019s office so no more clones could enter. \n\nSidious sends a massive bolt of lightning at Yoda who is shot backwards into the wall. As Mace and Obi-Wan advance on him, Anakin watched them all fight in a colourful blur of their sabers, almost like a dancing flower as its colourful pedals swayed with the wind. He had never seen anyone move as fast as Palpatine. He felt he should join in with his fellow masters, but the conflict within him was strong. Palpatine was the only one who could show him the way to save Padme. If he died, Padme died too. Mace Windu was pushed back with the force as Palpatine twirled steadfast onto Obi-Wan. It all was happening in the blink of an eye as Anakin watched from the corner of Palpatine\u2019s desk. Kenobi looked shaky, he had never seen his master like this. Even against Dooku all those years ago on Geonosis, he had looked more confident. His master wouldn\u2019t survive. What was worse, his instincts thought, his wife dying, or his best friend infront of him? Sidious used the force to choke Kenobi, raising him into the air. Windu and Yoda slowly rolled around as they tried to get to their feet, failing. Smoke emanating from their robes. Anakin felt the beads of sweat dripping down his brow, falling into the crevice of his scar like a tiny creek, the same scar that asajj dealt him years prior during the clone wars.\nHe watched the life leaving Kenobi, his best friend, his mentor. The man who raised him when Qui-Gon died. Willing to leave the jedi just to fulfill his promise. Kenobi\u2019s saber fell from his hand as Palpatine writhed with power. One hand up in the air, and the other clenching his saber. Where Kenobi\u2019s feet were kicking the air as hard as he could, now reduced to just feeble punts as he immediately dropped to the ground. Palpatine head first into the wall. Skywalker looked over to Kenobi as he lay unconscious on the ground. Please don\u2019t be dead, he thought. His lightsaber ignited as he stared at Palpatine who got up and saw it was Anakin who did that. Like a bantha in headlights, Palpatine was shocked Skywalker would do such a thing. \nYOU WERE BEHIND THIS ENTIRE WAR. \nPLAYING BOTH SIDES.\nYOU WERE BEHIND THE ASSASSINATIONS ON PADME\u2019S LIFE\nYOU CONTROLLED DOOKU\nI\u2026I trusted you.\n\nPalpatine didn\u2019t know what to say, for the first time. He merely just looked at Anakin, then to the boy\u2019s blue lightsaber. \nAre you going to kill me?\nSkywalker, stand down. You are too conflicted\nMace was shot back into Palpatine\u2019s desk as it crumbled into pieces.\nAnakin didn\u2019t even take his gaze off Palpatine.\nHe walked towards him as Palpatine summoned his saber from his hand, standing in the same spot, he ignited it like he had done moments before with the other Jedi, as they now laid scattered across the floor, lifeless, in pieces, like the desk. \nThe future master and apprentice locked sabers, as Palpatine taunted the boy. You are angry, Anakin, I can feel it. Use your emotions, forget what the Jedi taught you, they were holding you back. They lied to you.\n\nAs did you. Callously said Anakin.\nThey fought in a blaze of red and blue. Anakin was standing his ground, but he knew Palpatine wasn\u2019t unleashing his full powers. Not yet. Skywalker turned and twirled the saber behind his back, when he suddenly realized Palpatine had vanished and appeared behind him, as he looked down to see a red blade of fire locked ontop of a green blade, as Master Yoda had saved Anakin from losing yet another limb.\nCheck on Kenobi, you must. Handle Sidious, I will.\n\nBut Master\u2026\n\nYoda pushed the force out in both directions as Palpatine was sent back a few steps and Anakin was moved several meters. \n\nMaster. Master are you alright.\nObi-Wan lay in Anakin\u2019s arms, as Skywalker placed his fingers around Kenobi\u2019s forehead, sending energy and checking his vitals at the same time, jolting his brain to wake up.\nAs his looked at his master\u2019s familiar blue eyes slowly open, Skywalker began to smile. \nKenobi looked at his padawan and softly said: Wh\u2026what are you smiling at\u2026did you lose your weapon again?\n\nI feel it was important to give Anakin Skywalker a happy ending in this one, for once. \n\nWhat did you think of this ending?\nThank you for your participation in the previous video's comments. I read many and was inspired by some of your conclusions.\n\nSee you in the next video!\n\n\nContinue the conversation on the Theory forums!", "date": "Nov 24, 2021", "views": "952,414 views", "comments": "3,979", "likes": "46,845 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1302.281, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euh1QszYALE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG-WKcURuyc": {"title": "Amstrad LIVE Game Testing Ep158", "content creator": "Novabug", "description": "More entertaining than it sounds, I test some Amstrad CPC games from my collection while chewing the cud with viewers, this will become a weekly thing until all my games have be tested.\n\n**DONATE to Novabug via Streamlabs** - ", "date": "Streamed live on Feb 19, 2022", "views": "249 views", "comments": "1", "likes": "33 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6762.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG-WKcURuyc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbMAdtp7aE": {"title": "STAR WARS: The Old Republic - 'Disorder' Cinematic Trailer", "content creator": "swtheoldrepublic", "description": "Jedi Master Denolm Orr and his Padawan, Sa\u2019har Kateen, travel to the Temple of Nul on Elom to retrieve a special holocron before the Sith Empire can.

What happens to the warden and the guards who feed and tend the man only to send him off to die? What happens to the chaplain whose job is to minister to terrified people that the chaplain's own institution is killing? To the relatives of the man's victims -- do they gain some comfort or \"closure\" by the death of the murderer? To the relatives of the murderer -- is their grief or agony a fair price to pay for it all? Above all, we would get to know the condemned man, learn everything we could about him and his crimes, and record what happens to him as he sees his death approaching. Most Americans have made it clear that they favor the Death Penalty. But support or opposition to it seems based largely on abstract arguments and slogans about crime and punishment. What if the whole process were to be given human faces at close range? Might it have an affect on our opinions about Capital Punishment?", "date": "Premiered Aug 11, 2021", "views": "355,886 views", "comments": "1,597", "likes": "3,977 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5001.321, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwOhnXm_0-k"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jvpOpDraZU": {"title": "The Last Airbender - Nostalgia Critic", "content creator": "Channel Awesome", "description": "Only one can bring balance to the franchise! \n\nSee more at our Site: http://channelawesome.com", "date": "Jul 21, 2015", "views": "3,119,547 views", "comments": "11,122", "likes": "62,094 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2323.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jvpOpDraZU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibYMNB_R5E": {"title": "Hugging Another Dog Too Long | Jealous Dog Reaction", "content creator": "Tucker Budzyn", "description": "Hugging Another Dog Too Long | Jealous Dog Reaction\n\nWe had Tucker's friend Riley over for the week and Tucker just could not handle it whenever we showed Riley any attention.

Throughout the video, i explain why Dubai was designed so terribly, and the new, Dubai 2040 Plan that hopes to fix this whole mess.\n\nThe 2040 Plan is an incredible plan to fix most of the infrastructure problems  Dubai is facing. The plan also hopes for Dubai's population to go from the current, 3.5 Million residents, to 6 Million residents by 2040. More citizens requires more infrastructure, so this plan hopes to set Dubai up for a good future as a thriving City. \n\nDubai is a city in the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is home to the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, and many other incredible megaprojects. But the city is lacking key infrastructure for it to function properly. The Dubai 2040 Plan will fix all this, and will drastically improve the City in just 20 years.  Dubai is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.

It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity.\n\nBrothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm in anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta (Canada), Iceland and Los Angeles.

Here is the list of unusual cat behaviors. \n\nChewing on plastic\nIf your cat is chewing on plastic, blankets, furniture or other things they shouldn\u2019t be chewing on, they may have pica.  Cats often get pica from anxiety or disorders in their gut. \n\n\nItation of the ears \nEars movement is an indication that your cat is feeling uncomfortable or anxious about something in their environment. If their ears aren\u2019t moving independently and are only slightly pulled back they are alert and listening to what is going on around them.\n\n Not covering Their Litter\nIn the wild, cats dig a hole when the need to poop. When they are done, they cover it up to hide their scent from predators.  If your cat isn\u2019t covering their poop it is best to take them to the vet to eliminate the possibility of a paw injury or urinary tract infection. \n\nknock off everything!\n Cats feel their surrounding with their paws which are incredibly sensitive. By knocking things over they satisfy their curiosity, seeing exactly what will happen when they touch something.  \n\nNumber 10 \u2013 Tiger Eyes - narrow pupils. cat's pupil. \nThis usually stems from their predatory response and they are probably focused on their next bit of prey. This could be because they want to play and have fun with you, or that they have set their sights on a bug to hunt. \n\n\nNumber 9 - Rubbing\nAs a cat owner, one of the things you would notice the most is how they rub up against you with their head.  This behavior is called bunting. \n\nNumber 8 - Biting their nails\nOne of those reasons is keeping their nails clean and short. It could be thought that your furry friend is anxious or has a bad habit. Like people, cats can bite their nails when they are bored or if they feel anxious. And just like people, this can become a bad habit that is difficult to break. You will need to try and find out if your cat is just nervous or if they are bored and need some form of play or entertainment. \n\nNumber 7 - Crazy Runs \nYour cat may start sprinting around your house or apartment, bouncing off of the walls and furniture without any warning.  Naturally, cats can run up to thirty miles per hour and when they are kept indoors all day they energy becomes pent up. \n\nNumber 6 \u2013 Sleeping on your laptop \ncats like the warmth of your laptop. Cats like temperatures of 20 degrees higher than human\u2019s ideal temperature. \nNumber 5 - Eating your houseplants \nCats bite and chew plants for a variety of reasons. In the wild, indigestion is often cured by eating grass, so if they are feeling a little gassy they may start munching on your plants. \n\n\nNumber 4 \u2013 Crazy Legs\nCats sleeping exposing belly. sometimes laying down or sitting with your legs and arms sprawled is incredibly comfortable and relaxing. \n\n\n\nNumber 3 \u2013 2:00am Cat Calls\nSome cats enjoy a little night time singing. This can become extremely annoying, especially when you do not get to laze around all day and sleep like your cat does. There can be quite a few reasons why your cat is howling at night. \n\n\n\n\n\nNumber 2 - Straight from the tap \nGenerally, cats are not a great fan of water but a running tap seems to be their favorite drinking spot. Running water is clean and free of disease where still water usually contains all kinds of bacteria that may be harmful to your cat.", "date": "Jan 8, 2020", "views": "3,820,269 views", "comments": "4,254", "likes": "74,518 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 655.861, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6DjFX3rgJo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MHW2BG4F8U": {"title": "[Forum Weapon] Citation Needed!", "content creator": "nunyabiznasty", "description": "A forum weapon for people who want to give people a friendly reminder that they have to provide evidence for their claims, featuring the loudest sound known to mankind.\n\nPractically a really clean, context-free version of this: ", "date": "Jun 15, 2018", "views": "528 views", "comments": "2", "likes": "23 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5.101, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MHW2BG4F8U"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=132x9tfGbfs": {"title": "Varney: Here come the American truckers", "content creator": "Fox Business", "description": "FOX Business\u2019 Stuart Varney argues that the Democrats should learn from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s mistakes amid the Canadian trucker protests. #FOXBusiness\n...\nSTUART VARNEY: Here come the truckers.

But first of all, they are good and loyal friends. In this video we are going to talk about the Top 20 largest dogs in the world you won\u2019t believe exist.\n8 Leonberger\nLeonberger is truly a gentle giant, and he is undoubtedly playful and friendly. Tremendously calm, confident, and good-natured, many are reminded of the 'King of the Jungle.' Although always graceful and powerful, there are other reasons the Leo is likened to a lion. Bred was initially the perfect family companion. Although they may sound like the clear choice, this breed is not for everyone; grooming, training, and exercise all require a high amount of effort. Leonberger\u2019s height is usually from 65 to 80 cm and the weight varies from 45 to 77 kg.\n7 Akita-Inu\nAnother giant on our list of biggest dogs in the worldis a pet born in Japan. Now, this particular breed became world-famous after the movie about Hachiko, a faithful friend who waited for his owner for nine years until his end. The original goal of Akita-Inu is to hunt bears, boars, and deer. These dog representatives are excellent guards. Best suited to a one-dog household Akita can be a good family dog in the right hands.The average height of this dog reaches 61-70 cm while its average weight varies from 40 to 52 kg.\n6 Irish wolfhound\nIrish wolfhounds are considered the tallest dogs in the world, were initially bred to pull men off horses and chariots in battle. Today, this breed is a popular family companion with owners taking advantage of the breed's intelligence for use in hunting and obedience competitions.\nIrish wolfhounds do well with children and are friendly with other animals. Their friendly behavior makes them poor guard dogs, but their size generally intimidates potential intruders before they realize the dog only wants to play. This breed usually is around 85 cm in height and 55 kg in weight.\n5 Turkish Kangal \nThe Kangal dog takes is perfectly trainable, devoted to protecting its owners and their property. She gets along well with other pets, loves children, and sometimes even can act as a babysitter. Kangals are one of the strongest dogs in the world, and in some countries, they are still used to protect cattle from wolves and cheetahs. The cons of this breed are that they require a great deal of exercise, and the immense size makes apartment living virtually impossible. Kangal\u2019s average height is 71 to 81 cm while it weighs 43 to 65 kg.\n4 Great Dane\nAnother one of the biggest dog breeds in the world is the one that is commonly called the \"Gentle Giant,\" the Great Dane. This dog was initially bred to hunt wild boar. While the breed's giant size is often intimidating, the Great Dane is actually very well mannered, sweet, affectionate, and gentle with children.\nGreat Danes size can make it difficult for them to be ideal house dogs, so training is necessary. Great Danes are frequently considered the tallest dogs in the world which is not surprising since they can be 110 cm in height and weight 75kg. \n3 Saint Bernard.\nSaint Bernard is widely known as one of the biggest dogs in the world with a tender heart. Originally bred to rescue travelers and guard travel lodges in the Swiss Alps, Saint Bernard is a gentle, intelligent, muscular dog. \nDespite the breed's giant size, they prefer being indoors with their family. This can be a love-hate relationship as Saint Bernards are very friendly, easygoing, and generally happy to lie down and sleep while their family does their thing. These massive dogs have the average height of 65 to 85 cm and can weigh 110 kg.\n2 Spanish Mastiff\nThe Spanish Mastiff is one of the heaviest dogs in the world, and they have been around for a couple thousand years or more. They are easily distinguished by their size and the two massive hairy folds of skin that hang off their neck. While they are not fully recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC), they have been assigned the Working Dog group in the AKC's Foundation Stock Service since 2008. Spanish Mastiffs usually reach around 87 cm in height and 115 kg in weight.\n1 English Mastiff\nNumber one on our list and biggest dog in the world, is English Mastiff. Initially bred for war, thisgiant mastiff is one of the most massive and oldest dog breeds in the world. While the mastiff's ancestors were fierce war dogs, the mastiff today has a docile kind-hearted temperament. Mastiffs make fine companions for anyone who can accommodate their great size and doesn\u2019t mind a little drool slung here and there. If you\u2019re looking for a 90 cm dog that weighs as much as 120 kg and has lots of love to give, this may be the pooch for you!\nWhich dog is your favorite and why?

We\u2019ll start with a favorite toddler song, \u201cHop Little Bunnies\u201d which encourages language, pretend play, gestures and movement. Next we\u2019ll move to a learning segment where Ms. Rachel encourages babies and toddlers to practice their speech. Ms. Rachel alternates fun kids songs with learning sessions to keep children engaged, interactive and full of joy! Through the whole video, Ms. Rachel is sneaking in the teaching and practicing milestones for babies and toddlers such as speech, imitation, identifying parts of the body, pretend play, gestures and knowing colors, numbers and letters. \n\nResearch shows that the most beneficial screen time is interactive and Ms. Rachel carefully plans all of her material to be incredibly interactive and engaging. We also believe in the benefit of seeing real people modeling speech and gestures! All of our videos are based on research and we have many experts on our team such as a speech therapist and an early childhood curriculum expert. Ms. Rachel also includes baby sign language, which is shown to help with communication and speech development!\n\nIf you think your child has a speech delay or is not meeting their milestones, definitely talk to your pediatrician now. Also, call early intervention. Every state in the United States has Early Intervention. You may qualify for free speech therapy or other therapies through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a private speech therapist. The earlier you do this, the better! \n\nMs. Rachel has a masters degree in music education from NYU. She has also been a toddler teacher at a school for children with special needs including autism, apraxia, speech delays, developmental delays, down syndrome and cerebral palsy. She has worked in homes to support families with children with special needs. She believes all children are gifted, precious and our teachers as well! \n\nCheck out our other videos such as Talking Toddler, Talking Time, First Words, Learn To Talk, Baby Sign Language, Preschool for Littles and full baby and toddler music classes!

The service was lacking, food was embarrassing and the delays and cancellations were very frustrating. The seat however, was nice, as were the amenities that United had on offer to Premium Plus passengers. Is it worth the upgrade? Yes, certainly. Not for the service that United offers, but simply for the extra space you have. 16 hours is a long time to be in the air, but this seat was light years ahead of economy.

During these times it can be really hard to take a step back and wonder what\u2019s happening in the body, as opposed to just the mind, but it\u2019s the link between the two that can push us through it.  \n\nNeurotransmitters have some incredible power over how we function. Dopamine is responsible for craving, motivation, and pursuit. Adrenaline relates to agitation and endurance. Serotonin helps us be grateful and feel good about what we have. And acetylcholine can help us focus. This is just a snapshot of the chemical symphony happening in our bodies all the time, and we can actually leverage these inner reactions to better understand the way we react to the world around us and make positive changes. \n\nToday on The Dhru Purohit Podcast, Dhru talks to Dr. Andrew Huberman about opening the window into our neurochemistry, training the nervous system, and confronting our inner real estate. \n\nDr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist and tenured Professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He has made numerous important contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function, and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills, and cognitive functioning. \n \nDr. Huberman is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award in 2017, which is given to the scientist making the largest discoveries in the study of vision. His lab\u2019s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. Work from the Huberman Laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science, and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover, and other top media outlets.\n\nIn this episode, we dive into: \n \n - The connection between fear, laziness, and motivation (", "date": "Jun 24, 2021", "views": "514,323 views", "comments": "531", "likes": "14,220 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6010.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKyyF9MQXn4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp_kqamkYpw": {"title": "Half the universe was missing... until now", "content creator": "Veritasium", "description": "Half of the ordinary baryonic matter has been tough to find but Fast Radio Bursts made it possible to detect the WHIM.

These newly developed mini-satellites in a low-earth orbit as well as powerful antennas and signal processing chips make this possible.\n\nThe digital revolution has radically changed the way we live and work. But more than three billion people are still offline. As with any infrastructure, fast data connections initially reach urban centers. People who live in rural areas, even in rich industrialized countries, often have to get by without reduced bandwidth. Now several consortia are competing to bridge this gap with the help of hundreds of mini-satellites in low orbit.\n\nThe idea is not entirely new: 25 years ago, others already failed because of their over-ambitious plans and technical limitations. It is only now that high numbers of satellites can be produced quickly and cheaply through automation and mass production. In February 2019, the OneWeb consortium launched the first six 150-kilogram satellites into a low-earth orbit.\n\nOn their way to their final orbit at an altitude of 1,200 kilometers., the satellites must pass through a dense array of GPS and Earth observation satellites as well as the space debris of the past 60 years. Collisions are not exceptional. And hundreds more mini-satellites in space will mean even more space debris in the future.\n\nDozens of ground stations are needed around the globe to supply the numerous satellites with Internet data and receive data from space. This requires sophisticated antenna technology, which is also as yet available on the necessary scale. Not to mention the difficult regulatory challenges facing Internet providers in over 200 states and territories.\n\nThe original release date of this documentary was 2019.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In A.C. 196, Trowa sends the Gundam Heavyarms Custom over to Quatre to be destroyed. When he realized that the Barton Foundation is planning to carry out the original Operation Meteor, he infiltrates the the Mariemaia Army, much like he infiltrated OZ a year earlier, and uses a Serpent unit instead (Which has similar armaments to the Heavyarms Custom, as both were built by the Barton Foundation). Trowa switches back to the Heavyarms Custom for the battle in Brussels. During the battle, the Heavyarms Custom disabled many Serpent units without killing the pilots using specialized, non-explosive rounds. However, it eventually ran out of ammo due to the large amount of enemies and the toughness of the Serpents' Neo-Titanium armor. After the battle, the Gundam Heavyarms Custom is seen with Gundam Deathscythe Hell and Gundam Sandrock Custom as the pilots self-detonated them, destroying the Gundams once and for al.", "date": "Feb 21, 2021", "views": "338,024 views", "comments": "325", "likes": "2,972 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 88.361, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUQAnL3WLMw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa0AXYh-qOA": {"title": "Romans 2 | The New Testament Daily with Jerry Dirmann (Feb 20 + Oct 29)", "content creator": "Jerry Dirmann", "description": "Join us every day as Jerry walks us through a chapter of the New Testament, and gives us some amazing insights and applications.

Such a belief underpins arguments that a fundamental strategic reorganisation of Asia is inevitable, and that it will be necessary and perhaps even desirable to concede to China significant \u2018strategic space\u2019. Dependent largely on linear extrapolations about the future, such arguments ignore the implications of China\u2019s economic, social and national fragilities, its lack of major friends or allies in the region as well as the considerable military deficiencies and challenges faced by the People\u2019s Liberation Army. With the Defence White Paper due for release in 2015, the government should bear in mind that planning for an era of Chinese dominance in the region\u2014or even its emergence as an American strategic peer in Asia\u2014would be premature if not improbable. Australia should not design its defence force for war with China, but it should be able to counter Chinese coercion and contribute to Allied military operations if necessary.\n\nPaul Dibb is Emeritus Professor of Strategic Studies in the Strategic & Defence Studies Centre, Coral Bell schol of Asia-Pacific Affairs, ANU. He was head of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre from 1991 to 2004. Before that he held the positions of deputy secretary for Defence, director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation and head of the National Assessments Staff. He studied the former Soviet Union for over 20 years both as a senior intelligence officer and academic. He advised ASIO on certain Soviet activities. His book The Soviet Union--the Incomplete Superpower was published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies , London in 1986, reprinted 1987 and second edition 1988.\n\nJohn Lee is an Australian academic working on international economic and security affairs with a focus on the Asia-Pacific. Lee is an adjunct associate professor at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, a Michael Hintze Fellow at the Centre for International Security Studies, University of Sydney and a senior scholar at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC.

It's called the 'Active Multi-Axis Centripetal Wing' - let me explain.\n\nSo when you look at a Ferrari, then a Ferrari race car - there aren\u2019t that many differences anymore. Power is similar, suspension setups are similar, and so are the brakes. \n\nBut the main one is the aero - but! Properly clever active aerodynamics have slowly been appearing on modern supercars - and this Zenvo is the maddest of them all.\n\u2014\nEnzo Ferrari once said \u201caerodynamics are for people who can\u2019t build engines\u201d. In hindsight, he might be wrong. Aerodynamics has shaped the way cars look, made them faster and even more economical.\n\nAs technology has moved on, carmakers have tried many clever ways to improve aerodynamics. One of the most popular, particularly in modern supercars, is active aero. This enables a car's aerodynamics to change while it's moving.\n\nAnd by the way, folding the mirrors in on your Fiesta doesn\u2019t count.\n\nTo give you an example, a fixed rear wing can give you an improvement in downforce, pushing down on the rear wheels and increasing grip. Unfortunately, it also increases drag, making it harder for a car to move through the air at higher speeds - reducing its top speed.\n\nSo the engineers need to figure out something that can change dynamically. \n\nThe McLaren P1 is a great example of this. Not only can it hunker down closer to the ground, but the rear wing changes in height and angle depending on the speed or mode it's in. \n\n\n\u2b55 Why Rotary Engines Kinda Suck", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "595,567 views", "comments": "581", "likes": "11,830 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 423.081, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxf2-2FDw8o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF5gdofOO2k": {"title": "The Big Bang Theory Season 6 | Bloopers vs Actual Scene", "content creator": "The Coopers", "description": "Please Click HD 1080p for better Video Quality.

Follow a Keio University student from morning until evening.  This is a day in the life of University student in Japan attending Keio University, one of the top universities in Japan.  Japan university student life is much different than the Japanese salaryman life as college students have a bit more freedom to pursue hobbies, especially in their senior year of school in Japan.  An average Japanese student in Tokyo may have between 15-23 course hours per week while a Japan University student 4th year Senior will have much less such as 9 hours of course hours per week. Yusuke, 22 year old Policy Management Major at Keio University lives with his parents in a 2 story house which is commuting distance to school via train and bus.  Typical Japanese University life outside of class and study, also allows for part-time jobs and also a social life with friends. In fact, many Japanese students take on part-time jobs and find the time to hang out with friends in groups and join Japanese University Circles.  Generally, a typical Japanese student\u2019s class semester grade is based on assignments, presentations, group projects and 1 final exam at the end of the semester. But one interesting aspect about the Japanese university grading system is that many teachers don\u2019t let students know how each category is weighted so students can\u2019t calculate what they need to score on their final exam to earn a specific mark for the class.

That, moreover, was to a great extent inspired, and sustained, by a comprehensive cold war with the Soviet Union (or Second World, as it was once called).  The sphere of influence known as the West played a significant part in European integration, spurred phenomenal global investments in science and research, gave additional impetus to desegregation and civil rights in the U.S, and more.  Above all, the formation, consolidation, and maintenance of a sphere of influence disciplined American power. It even made possible an American grand strategy. Is any of that possible anymore? Will we now see the successful construct of enduring alternative spheres of influence, alongside a permanent decline of the Western one? Or are we overreacting to a misunderstood historical conjuncture?\n\nLecture I: The Gift of Geopolitics: How Worlds are Made, and Unmade\n\nAmericans and Europeans long tended to think of geopolitics as a kind of primitivism to be transcended. The \u201cescape from geopolitics\u201d has both a right wing and a left wing incarnation: the former rooted in a fantasy of universal democracy and benign US-led hegemony, the latter, in a world order governed by supranational institutions and pooled sovereignty.  What both share is a conviction that the rivalry of states, with conflicting interests and worldviews, produces conflict, insecurity and impoverishment.  Hence the \u201creturn\u201d of geopolitics today is lamented. But should it be? Interstate rivalry can unleash cataclysm, of course, but the wealthy, democratic West arose not in spite of geopolitics but as a result of it. The question therefore is not whether geopolitics is escapable or bad, but how the inevitable interstate frictions can be harnessed to push the major powers security and prosperity.\n\nFurther information:", "date": "Apr 26, 2017", "views": "227,336 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x009CFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x009677F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00862E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0088E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0088E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008B9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008A7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008B75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008A7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x008836B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00884546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00B69622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00C1882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00A623E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00A61443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0096D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00971518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00971660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x0097B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x757C6359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x774E87A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x774E8774+180]\n", "likes": "2,590 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 7270.941, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNHFGB5X7R8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDSZxUlGZnA": {"title": "1994 ASG: Meat Loaf performs national anthem", "content creator": "MLB", "description": "7/12/94: Meat Loaf sings \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" prior to the All-Star Game in Pittsburgh\n\nCheck out http://MLB.com/video for more!\n\nAbout MLB.com: About MLB.com: Baseball Commissioner Allan H.
