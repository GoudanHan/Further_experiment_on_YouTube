We also explore who the two beasts are that are given power from the dragon in Revelation 13 and why it is a sobering reality for churches today, especially those deceived by Christian Nationalism.\n\nResources: \nThe Climax of Prophecy\nby Richard Bauckham", "date": "Streamed live on Jan 15, 2022", "views": "1,206 views", "comments": "10", "likes": "65 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5045.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWMX2Z0wuO0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUz68EdLb0c": {"title": "What And Why Is \"Cancel Culture\"? - SOME MORE NEWS", "content creator": "Some More News", "description": "Go to http://buyraycon.com/somenews for 15% off your order!

Napoleon found himself 500 miles from friendly territory, outnumbered, poorly supplied, and with winter approaching.

Thafnine)\n\nIntro Preview:\n\nAh anime\u2026 my favourite, what do people who like anime say... uwu? I\u2019m gonna level with you guys here, one of my most commonly asked questions is if I watch anime, and although I have seen a couple movies when I was much younger: Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, I haven\u2019t really had the chance to enjoy much of it, although I have heard great things, and I really do respect the art, some of the art is truly beautiful. Now anime has been relatively popular since the early 20th century, it obviously originated in Japan, and often represented the cultural zeitgeist at the time.\n\nThe development of digital mediums has allowed the art to flourish and expand into new genres. One of those is of course, the video game genre. There are many anime video games, and it was in the video game heyday of the 1980s that anime inspired video games, and video game inspired anime rose to prominence. Since then, their popularity has continued to extend beyond their borders, with the style attaining international prestige amongst a variety of audiences. I also want to take a moment to talk about manga, which is typically used to refer to comics and graphic novels, often created in the Japanese style, manga precedes anime, and although mangas may be made reflecting an anime style, they are by no means the same. However, there is overlap, that overlap can be demonstrated in many characterisations of individuals, this is where we meet the Yandere. \n\nYandere is a portmanteau (which is our word of the day) of the words \u201cYanderu\u201d and \u201cDeredere\u201d, Yanderu meaning sick, and deredere meaning infatuated, deeply in love. So combined you reach the lovely idea that this person is in love to a sick extent, they will do anything for their senpai, even if that means often less than charitable activities. This personality trait is attributed to manga, however, it has gained popularity in anime as well, with many characters being modelled around that mould. The psychotic behaviour paired with an often cute design seems to be a good contrast that has become quite the rave, and it wasn\u2019t until one very cheeky game developer had a very cheeky idea, how about we make a whole video game from the perspective of a Yandere.\n\nThat cheeky game developer was a person by the name of Alex Mahan, currently operating under the very fitting name of Yandere Dev.\n\nWatch more to find out...", "date": "May 4, 2020", "views": "5,172,772 views", "comments": "22,587", "likes": "153,658 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5885.101, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1Zb90MFf20"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdt5-S5ZaYo": {"title": "The Dobre Brothers: Masters of Prank", "content creator": "Drew Gooden", "description": "Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring today's video!

He and I exchanged some words regarding racism, politics, and psychology, and hilarity ensued. As a disclaimer, there is no educational merit to this exchange whatsoever. This is 90 minutes of Jesse saying the dumbest things imaginable, and me mocking him relentlessly in response. Only watch this if that sounds entertaining to you.\n\nNote: I turned off comments because I got tired of spending 1-2 hours a day explaining basic logic to ignorant bigots. If you were planning to drop a comment on another video, or message me on some other platform, please first read the following:\n1) Out of wedlock does not mean single. You don't have be married to raise children together, and in fact, black couples disproportionately don't marry. Out of wedlock does not equal single parent. Read that sentence as  many times as you need to in order to get it into your skull. Jesse misrepresented the statistic, and then piled other claims on top regarding crime and drug use with no basis. He was wrong. Let me repeat. He was wrong.\n2) Jesse's ancestors were indeed slaves. He was lying. He is a liar. Google it.\n3) The history of slavery is irrelevant, so stop acting like you're a history scholar. It doesn't matter if there were times that slavery wasn't racist. When one race enslaves another race, it's racist.\n4) If you were planning on saying nothing but spewing Jesse's catch phrases, congratulations, you are among the dumbest people alive.\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates/discussions: ", "date": "May 15, 2020", "views": "657,962 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00EDFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E777F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D72E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D936B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D94546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x01079622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x0112882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F723E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F71443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E7D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E8B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x76E86359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x776087A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x77608774+180]\n", "likes": "10,100 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5544.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVG1dNygOgA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51a4N_qv-u0": {"title": "Endnote 1: What I Mean When I Say \"The Right\"", "content creator": "Innuendo Studios", "description": "patreon: http://patreon.com/InnuendoStudios\ntumblr: http://innuendostudios.tumblr.com\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/InnuendoStudios", "date": "Mar 14, 2018", "views": "483,685 views", "comments": "1,574", "likes": "17,871 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 253.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51a4N_qv-u0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-UH6VOg4Zo": {"title": "Destiny Crashes Conservative Panel w/ Lauren Southern And Brittany Venti", "content creator": "Destiny", "description": "DEBATE: Destiny jumps onto Lauren Southern's panel to defend himself against Brittany Venti and debate the panelist on a spicy topic...\n\nDate: 27 Dec, 2021\n\nFollow Destiny\n\u25baSTREAM - ", "date": "Dec 27, 2021", "views": "284,891 views", "comments": "6,813", "likes": "7,816 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6004.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-UH6VOg4Zo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8iU80w1DQQ": {"title": "Vaush DISAVOWS Hanz over XENOGENDER DISCOURSE, Debates Hunter Avallone & AikoRULZ - Chud Responds", "content creator": "Chud Logic", "description": "Hanz claims to have the same opinion on Xenogender as Vaush, resulting in Vaush striking back by disavowing Hanz' take and debating with both Hunter Avvalone and Aiko.

So we decided to improvise, and what resulted was a lovely creative exercise in resourcefulness, one that kept me glued to my edit suite until 2AM like I was back in film school. I hope you find it a little entertaining, a little fun, a little both - thank you for watching, because not only was it fun for all of us to make, it gave me some space to feel like myself again.", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "856,945 views", "comments": "1,004", "likes": "34,110 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 494.181, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH8Vdk0aAew"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyDQdswNNK8": {"title": "Patriots vs. Bills Super Wild Card Weekend Highlights | NFL 2021", "content creator": "NFL", "description": "Check out our other channels:\nNFL Mundo https://www.youtube.com/mundonfl\nNFL Brasil https://www.youtube.com/c/NFLBrasilOf...", "date": "Jan 15, 2022", "views": "2,548,647 views", "comments": "7,086", "likes": "30,136 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 841.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyDQdswNNK8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61PVs2N61H0": {"title": "I Must Win MrBeast's $10,000 Refrigerator", "content creator": "Technoblade", "description": "Mr. Sandman, bring me a Dream...\n\nRanboo: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKQ-...", "date": "Apr 4, 2021", "views": "25,321,572 views", "comments": "44,178", "likes": "1,115,640 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 787.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61PVs2N61H0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mun1dKkc_As": {"title": "WW1 - Oversimplified (Part 2)", "content creator": "OverSimplified", "description": "PART 1 HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHSQA...\n\nMERCH: oversimplified.tv/merch", "date": "Oct 21, 2016", "views": "26,653,381 views", "comments": "22,240", "likes": "341,045 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 460.081, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mun1dKkc_As"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11cyWOXg3rA": {"title": "Pawn Stars: Deals Gone Wrong (5 Angry and Disappointed Sellers) | History", "content creator": "Pawn Stars", "description": "Check out these five deals that took a turn for the worse when things weren't going as planned, in this Pawn Stars compilation. \n\nWatch all new episodes of Pawn Stars, Mondays at 9/8c, and stay up to date on all of your favorite The HISTORY Channel shows at history.com/schedule.", "date": "Apr 2, 2021", "views": "14,644,599 views", "comments": "7,034", "likes": "110,542 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1738.181, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11cyWOXg3rA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zms5CH7r1h4": {"title": "Otter Kotaro Birthday Buffet Party!", "content creator": "KOTSUMET", "description": "Welcome to Kotaro and Hana's Channel!\nLeave a like and Subscribe if you enjoyed!

During jump week, soldiers must successfully complete five jumps at 1,250 feet from a live aircraft. Paratroopers who successfully meet course requirements get to wear the coveted Silver Wings on their uniform, which they receive during graduation.

The 3DO Interactive Mulitplayer and Atari Jaguar both launched in 1993, Nintendo used the Super FX chip to create polygonal 3D games like Star Fox and Stunt Race FX on the Super Nintendo, while Sega used the SVP chip to create a home port of arcade hit Virtua Racing on the Genesis.  In 1993, Nintendo partnered with Silicon Graphics to develop their next-generation hardware, while in 1995, the release of both the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation signaled the \"real\" beginning of home 3D gaming.   After numerous delays, Nintendo finally joined the next generation of consoles, as the Nintendo 64 was launched in Japan and North America in mid 1996.  Although many gamers who grew up playing the Nintendo Entertainment System had, by the mid 90's, moved on to more \"grown-up\" systems like the Playstation and Saturn, the Nintendo 64 was a big part of the 90's childhood, and made Nintendo fanatics out of a whole new generation of gamers.\n\nCheck out Banjo Guy Ollie: ", "date": "May 27, 2017", "views": "2,864,676 views", "comments": "4,482", "likes": "34,019 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1954.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeHk5ujpZ2s"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pflU-nnY4MA": {"title": "Christopher Hitchens and John Haldane at Oxford - We Don't Do God?", "content creator": "The Veritas Forum", "description": "SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_...\nTHE VERITAS FORUM PODCAST: https://bit.ly/TheVeritasForumPodcast\nBEYOND THE FORUM PODCAST: https://bit.ly/BeyondTheForumApple", "date": "Dec 10, 2011", "views": "1,815,584 views", "comments": "6,742", "likes": "10,231 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6039.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pflU-nnY4MA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLOIQhHRPLo": {"title": "Cat Loves His Girlfriend That He Runs 'This' Much To Meet Her Every Day (Part 1) | Kritter Klub", "content creator": "Kritter Klub", "description": "*Please don't forget to hit the CC button for Subtitles*\n\nGet Cat Kitten Apparel here: https://bit.ly/KritterKlubCatMerch", "date": "May 1, 2021", "views": "2,716,834 views", "comments": "1,938", "likes": "38,939 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 270.721, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLOIQhHRPLo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMiug2sZ4Io": {"title": "Russell Brand & Ben Shapiro \"Respectfully Disagreeing\"", "content creator": "Russell Brand", "description": "I spoke with #BenShapiro on my weekly podcast Under the Skin from Luminary.

After  really rough day yesterday,  with tornadoes running all through the state, we are out catching a huge honeybee swarm from a cedar tree.   \n  I can't believe  it myself that this is the second swarm I've caught so far and both queens were captured before I ever shook the branch.  This is really making swarm catching fun.  \n   I hope you all are enjoying my 2021 Bee season kickoff with these swarm shakes.  I sure am.   I believe  it puts me ahead of my buddy's  Jpthebeeman, 628DirtRooster and Jeff Horchoff.   Although I know they will catch up quick, it's nice to lead the race at some point.   \n    Enjoy everyone and I hope you enjoyed a little fun from Yappybeeman.\n\n I get calls like this all the time, something flying in a small hole and it looks like bees or yellow jacket wasps. sometimes even for a squirrel or a raccoon. I enjoy every new experience when it comes to removing bees from structures. Construction obstacles always seem to challenge me with every job. As a bee remover, I find the good and bad in construction design. Some things look great but make it easy for bees to set up shop and call it home also. Other times, bees move in due to a lack of home maintainace. But no matter the reason, Yappy Beeman is ready to come rescue the honey bees. \n\n Check out my friends video channels also. Jpthebeeman , 628Dirtroosterbees and Jeff Horchoff for some more great honey bee videos.\n\nYappy Beeman is a professional bee remover  performing  live honey bee removals in Alabama as \"Alabama Bee Rescue\" and relocates them to apiaries away from residential areas so they can rebuild and thrive as a honey bee colony producing honey. Yappy is an Alabama Beekeepers association member that has performed over 500 live bee removals. Yappy with the help of his great friend and mentor; JpTheBeeman, a professional beekeeper , has learned many skills to remove bee swarms and honey bee colonies safely for the bees and homeowners alike.", "date": "Mar 26, 2021", "views": "14,248,935 views", "comments": "33,158", "likes": "285,614 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 438, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgOYLDf5Wv8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LGiFZV5hGw": {"title": "Stories of Us: Kirk Cameron", "content creator": "PragerU", "description": "Actor Kirk Cameron began his career in Hollywood starring in ABC\u2019s TV sitcom \u201cGrowing Pains.\u201d His success on the silver screen, however, left him feeling unfulfilled and questioning his purpose in life.

We saw in Versus Zoom (The Flash 2x18) Barry running so fast that he went through a portal, that portal sent him to Supergirl, and if you remembered in the Supergirl episode \"Worlds Finest\", Barry just appeared from a portal, said portal was, as mentioned, in Versus Zoom. In Worlds Finest, we also see Kara sending Barry back home and in Versus Zoom we see Barry running out of the portal. So I just merged scenes from both episodes, I thought it would look cool and further show was actually happened.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe scenes are a merger between the episode Versus Zoom from The Flash Season 2 and Supergirl's Worlds Finest from Season 1.

Go! Go!\u201d someone shouted as the rioters, some in military gear, streamed in. It was the start of the most serious attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. The mob coursed through the building, enraged that Congress was preparing to make Trump\u2019s electoral defeat official. \u201cDrag them out! \u2026 Hang them out!\u201d rioters yelled at one point, as they gathered near the House chamber.\n\nOfficials in the House and Senate secured the doors of their respective chambers, but lawmakers were soon forced to retreat to undisclosed locations. Five people died on the grounds that day, including a Capitol police officer. In all, more than 50 officers were injured.\n\nTo reconstruct the pandemonium inside the Capitol, The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and hundreds of videos, some of which were exclusively obtained. By synchronizing the footage and locating some of the camera angles within a digital 3-D model of the building, The Post was able to map the rioters\u2019 movements and assess how close they came to lawmakers \u2014 in some cases feet apart or separated only by a handful of vastly outnumbered police officers.

Belsen has gone down in infamy as a place synonymous with Nazi war crimes, but what shocked the liberators was the fact that many of the SS guards had remained inside the camp. Dozens of thousands of prisoners were left at the camp, and were slowly dying of disease and starvation, and around 13,000 dead bodies were unburied around the camp. The British acted to stop the Typhus epidemic that was killing so many, and then forced the Nazi guards to help to bury the dead. \n\nBergen-Belsen was a camp that became hugely overcrowded, and following its liberation a number of the guards who were arrested were brought to trial. What shocked many around the world was the fact many of the guards charged with murder and immense cruelty and brutality were young women. These women were placed on trial at the Belsen Trials, and many received prison sentences, but there were 3 despicable women who received death sentences and were executed by Albert Pierrepoint for their horrific crimes at Belsen and Auschwitz. Irma Grese, Elisabeth Volkenrath and Johanna Borman were sent to the gallows for their crimes against humanity. Grese was only 21/22 when she was executed, Volkenrath wasn't much older but the stories of their barbarism and violent tendencies resulting in the punishment and murder of prisoners shocked the court rooms. All 3 were found guilty of murdering prisoners with their hands of with weapons, and were even accused of setting their dogs on prisoners and shooting them indiscriminately. \n\nIt was British Executioner Albert Pierrepoint who took the lives of Grese, Volkenrath and Borman at Hamelin Prison. There were men sentenced to death and executed that day, including Josef Kramer the Beast of Belsen. There were other war crimes trials that brought other staff who worked at concentration camps to justice, but the events at Bergen-Belsen lived long in the memory and haunted many of the men who liberated the camp. \n\nSo join us today as we look at, 'The JUSTIFIED Execution Of The Female Guards Of Bergen-Belsen.'  \n\nThanks for watching!

But big dreams and spectacular hits also call for a bigger stage than the Moon Theater. The Crystal Tower Theater in the glamorous big city would be perfect - but there's one small problem. Actually, three. First, Buster Moon, mother pig Rosita, rocker porcupine Ash, elephant Meena, gorilla Johnny and pop provocateur, pig Gunter, must somehow make it to the office of music mogul Jimmy Crystal and convince the unscrupulous wolf to let them use his theater. It's a hopeless endeavor until Gunter spontaneously promises him the scoop: rock legend Clay Calloway (Bono) will return to the stage for this show! The problem: Buster has never met Clay, a lion who has retired from show business! While Moon's all-star ensemble works to put on the spectacular show, the koala sets out to find Clay. What begins as a dream of great success becomes an emotional reminder of the healing power of music.\n\n\u00a9 Universal Pictures", "date": "Dec 22, 2021", "views": "1,592,874 views", "comments": "190", "likes": "11,979 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 372.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMXylt6x1GI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhBjoWTCQ2o": {"title": "\u201cWe Don\u2019t Talk About Bruno\u201d but every time they say \u201cBruno\u201d it gets 0.3x faster", "content creator": "JustEm", "description": "hi i made this video at 2:30 am so yeah\n\ni don\u2019t own this song but i do own the edit", "date": "Jan 2, 2022", "views": "5,710,848 views", "comments": "5,824", "likes": "142,406 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 67.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhBjoWTCQ2o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBUu8hsNBwc": {"title": "I TRIED TO DEPLATFORM YOU - Destiny And Lauren Southern Join Leftist Panel", "content creator": "Destiny", "description": "Destiny and Lauren Southern jump into Kyosan's alcoholics panel co-hosted by Spectre\n\nDate: 1 Jan, 2021\n\nFollow Destiny\n\u25baSTREAM - ", "date": "Jan 4, 2022", "views": "190,162 views", "comments": "1,614", "likes": "3,764 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 9390.681, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBUu8hsNBwc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3vIhV7Vog": {"title": "a steak pun is a rare medium well done | Kitchen Nightmares", "content creator": "Kitchen Nightmares", "description": "am i sorry for the awful pun? absolutely f****** not.\n\n#GordonRamsay #KitchenNightmares", "date": "Jun 23, 2021", "views": "4,980,390 views", "comments": "3,838", "likes": "70,896 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 871.001, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3vIhV7Vog"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBHDg-JtA": {"title": "The Enduring Mystery of Jack the Ripper", "content creator": "LEMMiNO", "description": "[Credits, References, and More]\nhttps://www.lemmi.no/p/the-enduring-m...", "date": "Sep 9, 2021", "views": "4,493,185 views", "comments": "24,166", "likes": "325,089 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4148.841, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBHDg-JtA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYzT-Pk6Ogw": {"title": "It do go down", "content creator": "RaShaun Grey", "description": "Boat Prank Gone Wrong\n\nFollow Me:\nFACEBOOK - RaShaun Jones Sco\nIG - rashaungey\nSnapchat -@rashaungrey\n\nJukin Media Verified (Original)\n* For licensing / permission to use: Contact - licensing(at)jukinmediadotcom", "date": "Aug 30, 2015", "views": "54,434,932 views", "comments": "45,035", "likes": "1,472,170 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 23.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYzT-Pk6Ogw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDZf1s9XnHU": {"title": "Steph Curry Full Highlights | 2021 NBA 3-Point Contest", "content creator": "MLG Highlights", "description": "Steph wins the 2021 3-Point Contest\n\n#nba #nbahighlights #nbaallstar", "date": "Mar 7, 2021", "views": "2,623,103 views", "comments": "473", "likes": "34,140 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 260.641, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDZf1s9XnHU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuEpMzClZk": {"title": "Top 10 Undrafted Players of All Time | NFL Films", "content creator": "NFL Films", "description": "Although undrafted, these players left their mark in the NFL as legends.

They met 10 years earlier in college, where Erik first became addicted to chess \u2014 and Jay was the chess club president. They became friends through their shared passion for the game.\n\nThere were places to play online, but none of them felt like home. They imagined a site where people could build their chess home online and all in one place: to play in a safe and friendly environment, find friends, save their games, tell their chess stories, share ideas, and learn from each other.\n\nErik was mid-way through a graduate degree at Stanford and all of his classmates were taking jobs in finance or hot tech companies. But I turned down job offers (including Facebook!) to follow the dream of building the greatest chess site the world had ever seen. And he convinced Jay\u2019s wife to let him join me! Luckily enough, we found out that \u201cchess.com\u201d was coming available in a bankruptcy auction, and we bought the name.\n\nOver the next several years, Jay and Erik poured their life savings, their hearts, and most of our waking hours into building Chess.com. But they never imagined what it is today!\n\nChess.com Today\n\n- Chess.com hosts more than one million chess games every day . It\u2019s crazy. Even we can\u2019t believe it!\n\n- Chess.com employs more than 100 people as programmers, content editors, and member support. This team is entirely virtual (no office) and represents 12 countries!\n\n- Chess.com supports more than 50 world class chess players, coaches, and professionals by paying them to create awesome content.\n\nOur Values\n\nChess.com tries to be more than a chess site. We strive to be a community where chess fans from around the world can feel safe and happy while they grow as chess players. Here's what we believe in:\n\n- Kindness: We believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect. We encourage everyone to follow the golden rule of treating others how you would like to be treated. Be kind!\n\n- Learning: You never lose when you learn! Life and chess are both about learning, growing, experimenting, failing and then getting back up again with greater knowledge and understanding.\n\n- Joy: We believe in fun, smiles, laughter, and in creating enjoyable experiences for everyone. Chess can be pure joy! The beauty of the game and the pure satisfaction of moving chess pieces around a board\u2026 exhilarating!\n\nTypical 3000 Chess Match (Baka Mitai)\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:", "date": "Feb 14, 2021", "views": "1,796,571 views", "comments": "1,320", "likes": "32,497 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 91.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdPYvmx0UdM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9qjYySeWfU": {"title": "A Virgo And An Aries Make Cannolis", "content creator": "JennaMarbles", "description": "Here's the recipe we used https://www.glutenfreepalate.com/glut...", "date": "Aug 30, 2018", "views": "7,757,897 views", "comments": "31,105", "likes": "272,839 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 876.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9qjYySeWfU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohASXGSttJw": {"title": "Bully Maguire Bullies Kylo Ren", "content creator": "Maaahi", "description": "Bully Maguire : The Last Jedi\n\nCredit :-\nSpecial Thanks To (For Green Screens and helping me) :- Matan animation Studios, T0bey, Team Maguire, Id3y, Mork and SpiderDude. \nThese guys are awesome.

It can be tricky to pull off a victory especially in multiplayer however if you manage to exploit and glitch civilization VI you can give yourself an unfair advantage against AI and rival Players. So naturally today The Spiffing Brit is going to be demonstrating an efficient way of destroying friendships by showing off if CIV 6 is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if Unlimited Science glitch could perhaps put you at an unfair advantage... I mean surely spiff unlocking nukes before the other players have gunpowder is a rough demonstration of just how overpowered this glitch can be. But wait there is more what if Spiff also plays as Mansa Musa And gains infinite Gold and an Infinite Free army!! Thats right you too can have the largest army in civ 6 and have it also cost you nothing at all!!! Its perfectly balanced! So enjoy having more money than anyone needs and more science than all the other AIs combined thanks to a cheeky exploit involving duplicate districts!!! This is going to be the most exploit ridden civ 6 guide yet!\n\nSo sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Civilization 6 is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if the Infinite Gold, Infinite Science, Infinite Army is broken!! \n\nA huge thank ye to Potato Mc Whiskey for sliding this into my DMs. Check out his channel for some fantastic civ 6 glitches and mostly some great Guides for how to play the game especially the new gathering storm DLC : ", "date": "Apr 23, 2020", "views": "1,267,152 views", "comments": "4,601", "likes": "54,283 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1588.381, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgY19vB4PMo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz7OGxb9X6E": {"title": "Complete Heated Exchange between Sen.

This is often a clear sign that your pet is not happy.\nThey Don\u2019t Relax When You're Around\nSleeping puts a cat in a very vulnerable position. Cats are usually concerned about their safety and won\u2019t expose their vulnerable parts when they aren\u2019t sure about their surroundings. So if your cat doesn\u2019t let its guard down when you\u2019re around, it could mean they feel uncomfortable around you\nFlattening their ears around you\nCats lay their ears flat, either toward the side or back of their head, when they\u2019re feeling defensive or aggressive. \nWhen a cat is in this position, they are trying to tell you that they're uncomfortable and need some space. \nThey Poop on your stuff\nWhile there are many reasons that a cat may eliminate outside the litter box, like a medical issue or a dirty litter box, relieving outside of designated areas may be a sign that your pet is upset. For cats, peeing or pooping outside the litter box is often a way of marking their territory. If your feline friend leaves a mess in an obvious place, like the middle of your bedroom or on your belongings, that's them marking that territory as theirs and advising you to stay away from it. \nThe Cat Won't Touch or Be Touched\nWhen cats trust you, they will offer physical expressions of closeness. They will lick you, groom you, rub you, and sleep on you. But if you are considered a dangerous creature, a cat won\u2019t let you get close enough to impose threat. If you don't get any lap-sits, head-butts, or leg-rubs, it's probably because the cat does not trust you.\nThey lie down on their backs with their claws out \nMost animals are at a disadvantage when fighting on their backs, but a cat is capable of biting and clawing in this position. Some will even purposefully roll onto their back during a fight with another cat or animal.\nThey stare you down\nDoes your cat stare you down? It could be a sign of love or curiosity... or it could be because they're mad at you. If a cat stares right into your eyes, check their body language. \nA feline who is upset will exhibit telltale signs such as flatten ears, a stiffer body and an agitated tail that\u2019s swishing back and forth.\nThat body language, in addition to direct eye contact, is a clear sign that your cat needs some space.\nIn the animal world, prolonged eye contact without blinking is seen as an act of aggression and dominance. \nThey keep hiding from you.\nIf your cat is always hiding, it could mean they are fearful or unhappy with you or the situation.\nConstant hiding could also be a sign of an underlying health issue, so be sure to check a vet. \nThey bite you\nCats\u2019 biting is one of the most clear signs of resentment. \nIf they bite without backing away or trying to play afterwards, they\u2019re trying to show you they are agitated.\nThis is not to be confused with love bites, which are playful in nature and clearly not meant to pierce the skin.  \nThey Seem friendly with other people... But not you\nIt's normal for cats to have better chemistry or closer bonds with some people rather than with others. Cats are notorious for playing favorites, and some felines are just cooler than others, never warming up to anyone. \nThey Disappear Whenever You Are Around\nIf your feline friend insists on maintaining a distance from you, or even disappears whenever you come in the room, then there's a good chance they\u2019re trying to avoid you on purpose.\nThey hiss at you.\nIf your cat is hissing at you, then they're definitely unhappy.\nIf your full-grown cat is hissing at you, it's a sure sign they're upset and potentially feeling threatened. Keep in mind that growling, hissing, and swatting are often normal behaviors in kittens as they try to develop.\nChronic disinterest\nIf you try to play with your kitties and they're not interested no matter which toy you've got, it may be a sign they are unhappy. \nSure, it's normal for our feline friends to turn down playtime so they can relax every now and then, but constant disinterest in interacting with you could be a sign that your feline is not too happy with you.", "date": "Oct 9, 2021", "views": "1,465,881 views", "comments": "1,638", "likes": "18,642 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 480.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wBdyGLgLA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZZj831VbEM": {"title": "", "content creator": "Netflix Is A Joke", "description": "", "date": "", "views": "", "comments": "1,596", "likes": "122,930 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 870.481, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZZj831VbEM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhef5a5va70": {"title": "Why Anti-SJWs HATE Brie Larson (The Quartering)", "content creator": "The Kavernacle", "description": "Anti-SJWs and reactionaries have made countless video on actress Brie Larson ever since she was cast in Marvel\u2019s \u2018Captain Marvel\u2019.

Proving that Hollywood archery is not historical.\n\nIt is not possible to tell the whole story about archery in a 5 minute video.\nso this video is definitely not the whole truth!\nHistoric archery is a lot of different methods and much is forgotten\nbut archery can be much more than we usually think!\n\n\nTHE BACK QUIVER\nHollywood of course did not invent the back quiver, but they spread the myth it was proper archery!\nMany asked why I do not use a back quiver and that is why I am showing my own experience, how bad it is in motion.\nThere are many different historical variatoner of back quiver and they have of course been used, but presumably belt quiver was more common and some archers did not use quiver.\n\nHISTORIC ARCHERS HAD THE ARROWS RIGHT AROUND THE BOW\nAf course not all not all. Someone had the arrow left around the bow, but many historical archers had the arrow right around, also archers in Europe\n\nTARGET PLATES\nPast archers obvious used fixed targets, but not the modern round divided two dimensional.\n\nTHE THREE LEVELS OF ARROW HANDLING\nIt is obvious much more complicated, We can not know what the first archers did, some of the earliest pictures show arrows in the bow hand, but the arrow is much older than the bow so the quiver may be used and it is impossible entirely exclude that the first archer held his shafts in the draw hand.\nIn some parts of history is progress gone in the 3 levels, but other times the opposite has happened. Some archers are gone from arrows in the draw hand to the advanced rapid fire quiver that was developed just before war archery disappeared.\n\nTRICK ARCHERY IS HISTORICAL ARCHERY\nTraining tricks was an integral part of several historical traditions\n\nHISTORIC ARCHERS SHOT FAST\nThere are a lot of historical descriptions of archers that shoot fast\nand that archers were rejected because you were not fast enough.\n\nDO I HIT EVERYHING?\nI use a LOT of time practicing, and every time I set out to learn a new skill, a new trick or how to handle a new type of bow or arrow, it takes a long time, with plenty of misses. When I got the idea of grabbing an arrow in flight and firing before I landed, it took me months to learn. For a long time, arrows flew everywhere!\nBut there's no trick in the video that I haven't done many times (except for splitting the arrow in flight \u2013 after I'd done that once I finished the video). The one with hitting the blade I've only done three times, though. All that running hurt my knees. ;-)\n\nON MY BOWS AND POWER\nI'm 50 years old, and have been doing archery for only ten years. I'll never be able to shoot really fast with 100 lbs+ war bows. I tried, but it just produced injuries. Had I started at age 10, it would have been a different story. ;-)\nBows were not always shoot against plate armour (as at Crecy in 1346 and Agincourt in 1415). This was very much the exception. Many opponents had little or no armour at all, and Stone Age findings show that many animals were taken down by multiple shots. Also, in 1923 Saxton T Pope examined a number of historical museum bows from around the world.

After giving it a little squeeze of WD40 I disassemble it and sandblasted the revolver case. It was made of very cheap metal and had a lot of pitting therefore I grinded it with fine sandpaper grit 1000 and 1500 and then I did some serious polishing of the case just to make it look ok. I cleaned all the small parts in my mini tumbler. \n\nThis channel is all about the how to restore or make a new one things I do and how I do it . Mainly you will see here restoration videos because CONVERTING OLD RUSTY THINGS TO NEW THINGS ARE SO SATISFYING and I will also do some customization project which I hope you like it in how to restore channel videos\nI'm still learning how to work with Youtube,so please help me out by subscribing and if you like my content tell me what you think in the comments section. \nlike and Subscribe for more and stay tuned.\n\n\nThe handle was like the rest of the gun made of very cheap materials. so i decide to make a new one from wood\nI think it turned out OK and I am positive surprised that I was able to make it beautiful again .

And what do we think about podcasts that are better than ours? Find out on this week's Playing FTSE Podcast!\n\nWe start this week's show with a game from Steve D. Paul and Steve W try to guess how long different CEOs have been in post. Jamie Dimon, Lisa Su, and Mark Zuckerberg all make an appearance, along with some other business leaders that you might not have heard of. Twenty questions means that Paul doesn't have a chance. Or does he...?\n\nNext is the Motley Fools' restructuring. We're big fans of the Motley Fool (the US one, not the UK one) and we've often cited their podcasts as a source of knowledge, ideas, and facts that we use on our own show. They've restructured their show portfolio, though. Out with the Industry Focus/Market Foolery/Motley Fool Answers and in with a daily Motley Fool Money show. The Steves have been having a listen. Find out what they think of it.\n\nFollowing this, we've got exciting news from Trading 212. Stocks that were once available in an ISA and then weren't available in an ISA are available in an ISA again. Some of them, anyway. We point out some of our favourites -- Paul and Steve D discuss wind turbine company Vestas and Steve W gives us his take on nothing at all but suggests that JD.com looks like it's at something of a discount to its historic levels. Keep an eye out for Newcrest Mining though -- a rare mention of a gold miner on the show. \n\nLastly, it's a segment that Steve W *does* have something to say about. His own money. Having discovered that he owns some Premium Bonds that haven't been making much of a return, Steve's hunting for somewhere to redeploy his capital. He's looking at the REIT sector and thinking about how he measures the success of his investment and his returns. Paul and Steve D pile in with their thoughts. \n\n----------\n\nSupport the show:\n\nAppreciate the show and want to offer your support?

It was ported to Mac OS in 1998 and an expansion pack,It is remake fan version of Tomb Raider 2 Remake\n\nThe gameplay of Tomb Raider II builds upon the basic set up of the original game. Innovations in Tomb Raider II include new weapons, extra moves, and a set of vehicles. The crystal saving feature on the PlayStation version was eliminated, and instead the player may save at any time like in the PC version, save for a few special locations.\n\nLara can climb both horizontally and vertically[6] and perform a mid-air roll used to land facing in the opposite direction. The range of weapons has been expanded to include a harpoon gun,[7] a grenade launcher, an M16 rifle (which requires Lara to assume an aiming stance to fire), and automatic pistols, which replace the magnums from Tomb Raider. The inventory includes pyrotechnic flares, which are used to light up dark corners.[8] The two vehicles are a motorboat in Venice and a snowmobile in Tibet. Both are used to travel long distances across the map and can speed up on ramps or run over enemies.\n\nTomb Raider 2 Remake (PC) 4K 60FPS Gameplay - (RTX 3090)\n\nTomb Raider 2 Remake RTX 3090 Gameplay", "date": "Oct 20, 2021", "views": "594,504 views", "comments": "646", "likes": "8,555 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1278.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py8A6QH6ksg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6MCXnUJLNQ": {"title": "Dreamworld - Timeline of a scam MMO", "content creator": "Josh Strife Hayes", "description": "Go to https://NordVPN.com/Strife or use code Strife to get a 2-year plan plus 1 additional month with a huge discount.\n\n#####\n\nPatreon: ", "date": "Premiered May 10, 2021", "views": "628,373 views", "comments": "2,536", "likes": "26,210 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2054.361, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6MCXnUJLNQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=902j3CERYoE": {"title": "BLIZZ ****ED UP!

Among them were bridge design, passenger-carrying balloons (he would work seriously on a 15-20 passenger balloon service between London and Paris later in life), and firearms. Only a few years after Forsyth\u2019s invention of fulminate priming, Pauly would become the first to use it in a fully self-contained cartridge. He patented this invention in Paris in 1812, having moved there in 1802 in pursuit of financing for his many grand projects (going then by the name Jean Samuel Pauly).\n\nPauly\u2019s cartridge was a multi-part affair with a rimmed brass base containing a fulminate powder, connected to a paper or cardboard cartridge body which held a charge of regular gunpowder and the shot or ball to be fired. It was an expensive system, but contained all the necessary elements of a modern cartridge.\n\nPauly would move to England in 1814 (then taking the name Samuel John Pauly) in pursuit of aviation inventions, although he continued to tinker on his firearms design and filed to additional patent improvements. He died in London in 1821, and his name and work became rather obscure. His former apprentices would carry on his legacy in their own work - Nicolaus Dreyse would produce the needle fire system of Dreyse rifles used by the Prussian military, and Casimir Lefaucheux would create the pinafore system based on Pauly\u2019s designs. Lefaucheux in fact became owner of the company in 1827, and with his son would provide the most direct link between Pauly\u2019s design and the modern metallic cartridge.", "date": "May 4, 2019", "views": "656,828 views", "comments": "948", "likes": "21,522 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 968, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHuNo2XU57g"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLe0iwta9ao": {"title": "#BareshelvesBiden is back", "content creator": "Fox News", "description": "Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson looks at the causes of grocery store shortages on \u2018Special Report.\u2019 #FoxNews #SpecialReport", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "72,494 views", "comments": "882", "likes": "2,471 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 158.481, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLe0iwta9ao"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz8VcDWgpIM": {"title": "This Smartphone lasts 50 DAYS without Charging.", "content creator": "Mrwhosetheboss", "description": "These three new Android Smartphones from Energizer in 2019 are some of the best value phones I've seen recently.

The global deforestation is leading to growing problems. Nigeria and the DRC Congo - two of Europe\u2019s main charcoal suppliers - are also affected.\n\nEvery year, Europeans use approximately 800,000 tons of charcoal for barbecuing. Seventy percent of the charcoal comes from outside the EU, and the bags often contain remnants of tropical woods. Officially, tropical woods are subject to strict import conditions. But when it comes to wood charcoal, these do not apply. \nWorldwide, 2.7 billion people cook and heat with wood or charcoal. The related emission of greenhouse gases is enormous. 55 percent of global wood is used as fuel per year, and much of it is cut illegally in Africa\u2019s bush and tropical forests. Nigeria produces most of its charcoal for export. Especially during dry periods, local Nigerian farmers use coal production as a lifeline to make money and feed their families. At the same time, charcoal mills travel the countryside in family groups, charring all the trees they can cut down. The consequences are hair-raising. Nigeria lost 36 percent of its forests between 1990 and 2005. At present, twelve percent of the country is still covered with forest - but charcoal production continues to rise, eating up 350,000 hectares of fertile land here every year. According to the UN, charcoal production is one of the main causes of deforestation in Africa, which in turn is closely linked to massive deterioration in soil quality and a growing risk of crop failure. But African legislation has been slow to respond to the problem. The coal business is highly lucrative business, and rakes in some 7.4 billion US Dollars a year. According to recent estimates, the current illegal trade in charcoal is worth almost three times as much as the trade in illegal drugs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Yet during the pandemic, wealth has become a determinant of survival.\nThe pandemic hit New York in the spring, with almost 800 people dying from COVID-19 each day in April. The city has been uneasy since then. People's lives have been shaken by months of stay-at-home orders, changing public health measures, \"Black Lives Matter\" protests, the presidential election, and above all the economic consequences of the pandemic, including ever-widening inequality between New Yorkers.\n\nStefanie Dodt and Christiane Meier are the creators of \"New York City Rich and Poor - The Inequality Crisis.\" They spent more than eight months following the lives of three New York families who inhabit the different strata of New York society - the bottom, the top and the middle. \nThe documentary links this long period of observation with intensive data research and analysis and shows why, long before COVID-19, it was clear who the disease would hit hardest. The boundaries between rich and poor are often clearly defined by neighborhoods. Where a person lives determines their risk of becoming infected with the virus, and health has become more of a luxury than ever. The pandemic is spotlighting the scale and consequences of economic inequality in America. In New York, a city of extremes, the emphasis is white hot - and reflects in brash New York style the structural problems all of America is facing as COVID-19 further amplifies inequality. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

American business magnet and Microsoft developer Bill Gates has opposite views than Elon Musk from electric vehicles to the global pandemic.\n\nSo, why is Musk cursing Gates? And where is this rivalry going? Let\u2019s find out! \n\nHey guys! Welcome back to our channel Elon Evolution where we tell you all the latest news about Elon Musk and his multibillion companies. In today\u2019s video we are going to talk about why the most influential billionaires are standing against each other. And why is Elon Musk so mad at Bill gates? If you want to find out more, then stay with us until the end of the video. Also, before we start the video don\u2019t forget to hit like, subscribe to our channel and ring the bell icon for more amazing videos. And let\u2019s get started!\n\nBill Gates became a world famous entrepreneur in the 70s and 80s when he developed the windows operating system in 1985. According to time magazine, Bill gates is one of those 100 people who have made the greatest impact on the humanity in the 20th century. Gates has always been stern and notorious for his unusual antics as his management style at the Microsoft was bordering on the brink of insanity. Bill also has a big heart, and he has founded world\u2019s biggest charity with the name of \u201cBill and Melinda gates\u201d.\n\nTalking about Elon Musk, he is genius, billionaire and the CEO of many world\u2019s leading companies including SpaceX and Tesla. His net worth has grown tremendously since 2020 and it has been the most rapid enrichment in the history of mankind. Elon Musk is aiming at making the life multi-planetary and he is also fighting against the climate change on earth by abandoning fossil energy sources. The billionaire is also known for his erratic tweets as his statements have the power to turn markets upside down in a matter of seconds.\n\nSo, now let\u2019s talk about the ongoing feud between the two most influential billionaires.\n\nIt all started with the electric vehicles in February 2020 when Bill Gates shared that he bought an electric car but he preferred buying Porsche Taycan which is a German rival of Tesla model s. People were quick to point this out and asked Musk about his opinion on this. In response to twitter users, Musk said that he is not very impressed by the conversations with the former head of Microsoft and hinted at the intellectual failure of the billionaire.\n\nFurthermore, both of them also genuinely disagreed on their opinions related to corona virus. As both of them are key participants in virus treatment and vaccine development, their disagreements has had major impact on the global pandemic. Elon musk doubled down on corona virus skepticism, and he even called pandemic quarantine a fashion. In an interview on CNBC, Bill Gates criticized Musk on his controversial comments and stated that Musk should not be speaking about the pandemic at all. According to Gates:\n\n\u201cElon\u2019s positioning is to maintain a high level of outrageous comments. You know, he\u2019s not much involved in vaccines. He makes a great electric car, and his rockets work well. So, you know he\u2019s allowed to say many things. I hope that, you know, he doesn\u2019t confuse areas he\u2019s not involved in too much\u201d\n\nElon Musk got mad at his comments and in response to Bill\u2019s remarks he posted multiple tweets on twitter and said that:\n\u201cBilly G is not my lover\u201d", "date": "Dec 11, 2021", "views": "1,319,244 views", "comments": "5,779", "likes": "24,024 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 549.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuPKqypDHow"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLxPAwIeL0w": {"title": "Tesla - Pretend to Save the Environment While Looking Rich", "content creator": "AwakenWithJP", "description": "Owning a Tesla is the best way to pretend to save the environment while looking rich.

It snowed almost non stop the entire trip and temperatures stayed around 23 F (-5 C). I cooked up some delicious cheese steak sandwiches on the wood stove for dinner and had scrambled eggs for breakfast. Before I packed up I got to play around with the Dwarf Telescope made by TinyScope. It worked surprisingly well and I can't wait to use it somewhere with an actual view.
