Coming upon what is to be an omen of their future... an outlaw hung by a group of vigilantes...the trio finds shelter at a cabin, only to discover that their \"hosts\" are men who have robbed a stagecoach and killed the guard. When an avenging posse attacks the cabin, Wes and Vern escape, only to find that they have become branded as 'outlaws' by the posse, who relentlessly pursue them.\n\nReviews:\n\"A very Low-Budget, Alternative Western Penned by and Starring Jack Nicholson and Directed by the Minimalist and Philosophical Monte Hellman, this is Proof Positive that Quality, Engaging Movies can be Made by Thoughtful, Talented Movie Makers with just a Dab of Dollars.\n\nAlong with its Sister Shoot \"The Shooting\" (1966), Neither Receiving an Initial American Release (Who was in charge of these things?), both Films are Now Considered Excellent B-Movies and have gained Cult Status.\n\nThis one is more Bare-Bones in its Conceit than its Existential Other, it Works just as Well as \"The Shooting\", Just On a Different Plane of Existence.\n\nJack Nicholson seems to Appreciate and Understand \"Western Speak\" and His Script, is Filled with Scant but Succinct, Spot On Dialog. When the Characters Talk it is from Experience and a Sort of Intellectual Insight. Their Words are Few but Meaningful Learned from the School of Hard Living.\n\nCameron Mitchell is totally Believable as Nicholson's Riding Companion, and the other well Known Character Actor Harry Dean Stanton makes His Mark in a Small Role. But the whole Cast seems to be on the Film's Wavelength and All Contribute to the Experience and None Detract.\n\nHighly Recommended for Nicholson's Fine Script, Hellman's Sure Hand Direction, and a Cast of Truly Believable Actors Playing Truly Believable Characters.\n\nEverything Clicks and the Team of Independent Filmmakers Made a Western that has Stood the Test of Time and it would Not be Hyperbole to Call this a Minor Gem.\" Written by LeonLouisRicci on IMDb.com.\n\n\"This one is much better in my opinion than The Shooting, which was made about the same time, mainly because the story made sense. The screen writing by a young Jack Nicholson is surprisingly very good.\n\nThis was made on a low budget, and is a good example of how movie producers can make very good films without spending many tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThere are decent performances by all the cast here. The movie is set in some wisely-chosen locations, and the camera work is very good.\n\nThis one for me is more realistic and down-to-earth than most westerns. The characters are all believable, as are all the events - people are behaving the way people probably would in those situations.\" Written by Freedom060286 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Ride in the Whirlwind\nArgentina: A trav\u00e9s del hurac\u00e1n\nBrazil: A Vingan\u00e7a de um Pistoleiro\nCanada (English title): Ride in the Whirlwind\nFinland (video title): He ratsastivat el\u00e4\u00e4kseen\nFinland: He ratsastivat l\u00e4pi luotisateen\nFrance: L'ouragan de la vengeance\nGreece: \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03b2\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\nHungary: Lovasok a forg\u00f3sz\u00e9lben\nItaly: Le colline blu\nPoland: Nies\u0142usznie oskar\u017ceni\nPortugal: O Furac\u00e3o\nRomania: C\u0103l\u0103re\u015fte \u00een v\u00e2rtejul de v\u00e2nt\nSoviet Union (Russian title): \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0433 \u0432 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430\nSpain: A trav\u00e9s del hurac\u00e1n\nSpain (alternative title): Forajidos salvajes\nSweden (video box title): Jagad mot d\u00f6den\nSweden (video title): Rid f\u00f6r livet\nSweden (video title): Dom red f\u00f6r livet\nSweden (TV title): Tre red f\u00f6r livet\nUK: Ride in the Whirlwind\nUSA: Ride in the Whirlwind\nWest Germany: Ritt im Wirbelwind\n\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n\n\u2718 Website: ", "date": "May 1, 2021", "views": "2,004,083 views", "comments": "215", "likes": "12,426 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4926.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7kcog5woGg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncnDSjn7DXU": {"title": "Relaxing Piano Music with Beautiful Winter Photos \u2022 Soothing Music for Studying, Sleeping", "content creator": "Relax Time", "description": "\ud83c\udf3f Music for relaxation, meditation, study, reading, massage, spa or sleep.

Every time they migrate they must pack the whole tent away, drag it across the tundra on sledges, and erect it again in a fresh place, sometimes in temperatures of minus thirty degrees. Survival depends on working together as a team.\n\nAfter staying in the wooded taiga for two months they start to migrate north following the ancient paths of migrating reindeer (caribou). In four months they will travel up to 1200km and must pack and move every three to five days to keep up with their herd. They must reach their summer quarters before the snows melt and flood great rivers with icy waters too cold and deep for the calves, born along the way, to cross. \n\nBehind the tent an invisible line extends out into the tundra. It is called the sawei line, and a woman cannot cross it. It will bring bad luck to the tent. It was hard for them to explain exactly why, it is much stronger than a superstition and is connected to the spirit pole that stands at the back of the tent. This pole is sacred and a woman cannot cross underneath it either, and only a shaman may sit in this holy place. The origins of this are a little lost, there may be practical reasons, for example the back of the tent is traditionally where the men work, often together, so they have to be able to move about freely, but there are often two families in a single tent, so maybe one day the women just agreed territories to stop tripping over each other. Maybe it has such a mundane origin, or maybe there are real spirits that come up to the tent from behind and would bring harm to any women caught in the wrong place. If several tents pitch together, their lines must not cross either, so they tend to camp in a straight line to avoid this.\n\nIn answer to the many questions -  on personal hygiene, everyone washes using a bowl of soap and hot water, just like most of our grandparents did before everyone had pipes and taps. There is no toilet in the tent as some have suggested, they find a spot a few hundred metres away. They are not pitching on a lake but a small mound where the snow blows a little thinner, Gas companies have been in the area and gave away snowmobiles as part of land access negotiations. Also sometimes there are competitions with them as prizes, sometimes they sell a load of reindeer and buy one. Most families now have at least one but the reindeer are still used a lot. Yes, they use a sled to go to town, or trading posts to buy groceries.\n\n\nI wanted to catch the entire process, but have edited it down a little from the 40-45 minutes it takes to get from the open snows to a warm cosy home.\n\nBuy our book here:  ", "date": "Feb 10, 2021", "views": "16,728,437 views", "comments": "14,041", "likes": "229,166 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1933.801, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gI6q4R8ih4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UiJ_ROkRXs": {"title": "Dating A D1 Athlete!", "content creator": "Kai Cenat", "description": "MERCH: https://mafiaworldwideclothing.com/\n\nMake Sure You keep Up With All Of My Social Medias:\nInstagram: ", "date": "Jan 11, 2022", "views": "2,541,324 views", "comments": "8,760", "likes": "154,554 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 638.081, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UiJ_ROkRXs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2dHqClLGY": {"title": "DAZ WATCHES MOST SPOILED CHILDREN IN THE WORLD", "content creator": "Daz Games", "description": "MERCH : dazblackshop.com\n\nTWITTER : https://twitter.com/daz_black", "date": "Oct 28, 2021", "views": "2,657,549 views", "comments": "4,369", "likes": "122,553 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 810, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2dHqClLGY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XPi2RKYPX0": {"title": "FULL MATCH - 1992 Royal Rumble Match: Royal Rumble 1992", "content creator": "WWE", "description": "Witness one of the most amazing Royal Rumble Match fields ever, as Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, The Undertaker and more Superstars vie for the vacated WWE Championship: Courtesy of WWE Network.\nWWE Network | Subscribe now: ", "date": "Jan 22, 2021", "views": "10,916,445 views", "comments": "9,902", "likes": "90,621 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4152.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XPi2RKYPX0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_Nnh7KKNWc": {"title": "Mary Kate And Ashley Olsen's Emotional Tribute To Bob Saget", "content creator": "The List", "description": "News of the heartbreaking death of comedian and actor Bob Saget, 65, has sent a legion of fans into mourning worldwide.

Developed during the late 1920s, it would become the largest landplane in the world when it first took off in 1929. Despite only two being built in Germany, they would quickly make a name for themselves with Lufthansa as luxurious air liners.\n\nIts main feature was the massive wing, which had a span of 44 meters and was almost 2 meters thick. This allowed it to hold a pair of passenger cabins, 'engine rooms' for mechanics to service the engine, and a large fuel capacity - giving it excellent range and endurance. Unfortunately the aircraft was let down somewhat by its lack of passenger capacity (never exceeding 34), but it was an exciting demonstration of 'big wing' design. The G38 was also built under licence in Japan as the Mitsubishi Ki-20 (or Type 92).\n\n***\n\nProducing these videos is a hobby of mine. I have a passion for history, and personally own a large collection of books, journals and other texts, and endeavor to do as much research as possible.

It was my first attempt at videoing a solo winter trip. I snowmobiled high up in the mountains, about 6 miles from my cabin. The wind blew the entire time, but the temperature was almost balmy, and stayed around 20 degrees (-7\u00baC) all night long. It was an absolutely beautiful evening and one I will remember for the rest of my life. It is always a lot of work to get out into the mountains and set up a camp, but it is always worth it. I don't want to miss nights like these.\n\nFor those of you who wonder, the sleeping bag I rolled out was only my base layer. I have a much better bag that keeps me comfortable down to -40\u00ba F. I don't depend on the fire to keep me warm at night. I always allow it to go out when I'm sleeping (unless I'm in my Arctic Oven tent), and just trust my arctic bag to keep me comfortable. Having the right sleeping bag and other gear, is key to enjoying a these beautiful winter nights in the mountains.\n\nIt is my hope that this video will bring some cool refreshment to those of you in warmer climates. \n \nPeace to you from Alaska", "date": "Aug 6, 2021", "views": "1,452,557 views", "comments": "989", "likes": "16,560 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1097.141, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzC3LQVDvGk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw7qsAoJs3g": {"title": "World's Fastest Workers!", "content creator": "Beast Reacts", "description": "These workers are so good at their jobs that they can do them at blistering speeds, and we react to the fastest ones we could find!\n\nFOLLOW THESE CHANNELS OR ELSE\n\n\u304a\u91d1\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "date": "May 11, 2021", "views": "41,409,863 views", "comments": "20,532", "likes": "802,733 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 540, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw7qsAoJs3g"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIivnffFgl4": {"title": "FULL MATCH - Team Raw vs. Team SmackDown - Men's 5-on-5 Elimination Match: Survivor Series 2017", "content creator": "WWE", "description": "Kurt Angle, Braun Strowman, Samoa Joe, Finn B\u00e1lor and Triple H represent Raw in a battle for brand supremacy against SmackDown's team of Shane McMahon, Bobby Roode, Shinsuke Nakamura, Randy Orton and John Cena at Survivor Series 2017: Courtesy of WWE Network.\nWWE Network | Subscribe now: ", "date": "Nov 14, 2020", "views": "55,697,804 views", "comments": "8,445", "likes": "622,972 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2301, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIivnffFgl4"}}
