To alone, with only simple hand tools and raw power, build my own traditional off grid log cabin by hand from the materials of the Swedish forest. I film everything myself and edit these videos so you can follow my journey and hopefully learn as I do. I have no earlier experience in any of this, just a visualization of what I want to achieve and willpower to learn and improve everything necessary. So I enjoy reading good advice in the comments. Enjoy! \n\nIn this episode I am fitting the ceiling into the log cabin. The boards edges had to be debarked and rounded off to give a good look, this was probably the most time consuming. All the lumber is from own forest and was sawed by a \"neighbour\", as shown in the end. I was considering hand splitting small logs, but my grandfather highly advised me to this method.\n\nHow to Support Erik Grankvist Channel!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nMerch: ", "date": "Mar 31, 2021", "views": "2,187,526 views", "comments": "1,568", "likes": "37,873 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1857.261, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdSW-Hnvdnc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th71O_Wm_Mk": {"title": "Peter points out how dumb new WH guidance is and Psaki just makes it worse", "content creator": "Epoch US News", "description": "#BidenJokes #BidenMeme\nPeter points out how dumb new WH guidance is and Psaki just makes it worse", "date": "Jan 16, 2022", "views": "376,158 views", "comments": "2,116", "likes": "8,161 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 77.681, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th71O_Wm_Mk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMbOTzD-RmA": {"title": "Jan 16 2022, Sunday Service, SUB : ONE BODY & ONE BAPTISM.", "content creator": "CSI KCD HOLY TRINITY CHURCH", "description": "SUB : ONE BODY & ONE BAPTISM.\nBible Readings\n1.

Welcome back to another video. Behind the scenes of the Harry Potter films was basically a prop wonderland. With magical trinkets like wands, time-turners, and flying cars laying around, it\u2019s no surprise the HP cast has their fair share of stories involving swiping props from set. \n\nHowever, taking home a Harry Potter prop wasn\u2019t the easiest of tasks, not even for the chosen one or as the real world knows him, Daniel Radcliffe. Today, we\u2019re taking you through each cast member's experience with their stealing shenanigans and letting you in on the secret of which props actually left the studio gates. \n\nWhile some actors were successful in their endeavor - one of your favorite Weasley\u2019s even walked away with the flying car from Chamber of Secrets - others were left embarrassed after getting caught before making a clean getaway. \n\nThe Harry Potter filmmakers had strict rules when it came to the wardrobe and prop departments because the worth of the props were through the roof and were actually property of Warner Brothers. But that didn\u2019t stop the cast from trying and sometimes succeeding to the point of selling a prop for twenty-five thousand dollars! \n\nThere\u2019s no denying that the filmmakers had every right to want and control their props as much as possible, however hearing about these cast stories only adds to how unique the Harry Potter cast's time on set really was. What Harry Potter prop would you have wanted to walk away with? Let us know below.

Peterson interview comebacks. One of the reasons I think Jordan Peterson is so popular is his willingness to take on contentious issues and interviewers with fearless zeal. We all want to be as strong, courageous and quick on our feet as JBP.\n\n\nDr. Jordan B Peterson was raised as a Christian conservative, and began questioning religion in his early teens. He criticizes the New Atheists (specifically Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris) for oversimplifying the philosophy of Christianity when making their critiques. Peterson often points to the symbolic underlying meaning of the archetypal ideas in religious mythology when explaining his understanding of religion.\n\nHe grew up in Fairview, Alberta, Canada, a small town of 3,000 people 580 km (360 mi) northwest of Edmonton, Alberta. He resided in Montreal from 1985 to 1993, where he studied under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl and Maurice Dongier. From 1993 to 1998 he lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard. He has resided in Toronto since 1998.\n\nAt the age of 13, Peterson had joined the New Democratic Party (NDP). He remained continually active with party until the age of 18. He has two bachelor degrees from the University of Alberta. His first was in political science. After visiting Europe, Peterson became extremely interested in the psychological unpinning that created the circumstances of the Cold War and its origins within the Second World War. After this experience, he returned to the university to complete another bachelor in psychology.\n\nHe received his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from McGill University. He taught at Harvard University as an assistant and an associate professor. There he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse. During his time at Harvard, the university psychology department would frequently send any student with a strange or unusual thesis to him, as he would be willing to entertain and supervise uncommon thesis proposals. After Harvard, he returned to Canada and took a position at the University of Toronto.\n\nIn March of 2017, Peterson was nominated for the position of Rector of the University of Glasgow. Peterson who received 442 votes came fifth in the election, losing to the Scottish lawyer Aamer Anwar who received just under 4500 votes.\n\nVideo Notes\nThis video was color corrected and the audio was enhanced for the best possible viewing and listening pleasure. \n\nJordan Peterson Links:\nWebsite: ", "date": "Jul 6, 2018", "views": "9,152,329 views", "comments": "12,101", "likes": "145,771 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 700, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbHhIpRwPC8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xp4z5qlyqs": {"title": "Bill Burr - Motherhood Isn't The Hardest Job", "content creator": "Just For Laughs", "description": "#BillBurr on the difficulty of being a mother, and how he ended up with a pit bull while on tour.\n\n#BillBurrStandUp from the #JustForLaughs Festival in 2010\n\n2010s playlist: ", "date": "May 30, 2016", "views": "9,408,802 views", "comments": "5,530", "likes": "153,292 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 501.201, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xp4z5qlyqs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guY6w20Lv6o": {"title": "NEVER Pitch a Pyramid Scheme on Shark Tank or Dragon's Den", "content creator": "Coffeezilla", "description": "the greatest pyramid scheme roast of all time, courtesy of Dragons Den, a show about investors hearing pitches and investing in them.\n\nFollow me!\ntwitter: ", "date": "Jan 8, 2021", "views": "3,551,003 views", "comments": "7,847", "likes": "119,134 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1612.601, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guY6w20Lv6o"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J2YOLQM2Yc": {"title": "The Case of Michael Rafferty", "content creator": "JCS - Criminal Psychology", "description": "M.

Ground beef is more dangerous than whole cuts because the exterior has been mixed into the interior. Fish is more complicated (depending on the species), but very few people get sick from eating totally raw fish (i.e. sushi). High-quality pork can be safe when cooked pink, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (finally) acknowledged in 2011.\n\nSOURCES\n\nDr. Diez-Gonzalez: ", "date": "Jun 10, 2019", "views": "4,530,594 views", "comments": "9,637", "likes": "123,403 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 255, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL9RyGqwcbA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS1XKhew9dY": {"title": "Cringe SJW's On LIve TV Compilation!

Thus, a larger portion of the flame follows the positive ions, moving towards the negative plate. \n\nThe negative  charge are electrons and are very much lighter than the positive ions. They move faster towards the positive plate and more easily.\n\nThus, the portion of the flame that follows the negative ions are much smaller and thinner. This practical really does need a 25kV supply to work well. \n\nAlso in a uniform electrical field the electrical field strength (Vm-1)  is E\u221d\ud835\udc49/\ud835\udc51  so when we move the electrodes closer they put out the flame as E\u221d1/\ud835\udc51  as the field strength is stronger. \n\nAt the end we can see the soot on the negative electrode due to the ions from the flame.\n\nIt's a great demo for separation of ions and electrons and evidence if charged ions. Also clearly the mass of the positive is more not that there are more, slip of the tongue!\n\nThe demo is dangerous so you must take care and no pupils close to it. My EHT is current limited for safer use in schools.\n\nFinally the video has one error when I talked about the ions there are clearly the same POS and negative ones. The masses are the differences.\n\nLastly it's quite hard to get the flame to go out, I was lucky...so don't be disappointed if you fail!", "date": "Nov 24, 2020", "views": "2,747,622 views", "comments": "2,415", "likes": "64,414 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 171.081, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L51kg_n2PYo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVgkZZVJbCg": {"title": "Bloopers - Outtakes - Jojo Rabbit 2019", "content creator": "Cine Extras", "description": "Playlist: Behind the Scenes and Deleted Scenes From Jojo Rabbit 2019: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...", "date": "May 19, 2020", "views": "1,584,109 views", "comments": "837", "likes": "37,504 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 207, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVgkZZVJbCg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCUTX1jurJ4": {"title": "Data | Philosophy Tube", "content creator": "Philosophy Tube", "description": "When all you have is a hammer all your problems look like nails - https://www.patreon.com/PhilosophyTube", "date": "Premiered Jan 31, 2020", "views": "746,211 views", "comments": "5,984", "likes": "61,165 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1573.761, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCUTX1jurJ4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqn0Y3r23o8": {"title": "We Can't Lose Our Sense Of Humour | The Russell Howard Hour", "content creator": "Russell Howard", "description": "From his brand new Netflix special, Lubricant, Russell talks about the dangers of not taking jokes.\n\nLubricant is out NOW on Netflix!\n\n\n.\nWelcome to the official Russell Howard channel!

Harness the power of stars, collect resources, plan and design production lines and develop your interstellar factory from a small space workshop to a galaxy-wide industrial empire\nCombining Factorio and Satisfactory on a Galactic scale!\n\nABOUT THE GAME\nDyson Sphere Program is a sci-fi simulation game with space, adventure,\nexploration and factory automation elements where you have to build your\nown galactic industrial empire from scratch\nIn the distant future, the power of science and technology has ushered a new age to the human race. Space and time have become irrelevant thanks\nto virtual reality. A new kind of supercomputer has been developed \u2013 a machine which superior artificial intelligence and computing capability will\npush humanity even further. There is only one problem: there isn\u2019t enough\nenergy in the whole planet to feed this machine.\nYou are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing a Dyson\nSphere, a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its\npower and energy. Only a few decades ago it was considered a hypothetical, impossible invention \u2013 but now it\u2019s in your hands\u2026 if you can manage to develop this space workshop in some galactic backwater into a galaxy-wide industrial production empire!\n\nABOUT EARLY ACCESS\nWhile the core mechanics of Dyson Sphere Program are ready, the game still can grow and evolve a lot \u2013 and Early Access is just the perfect place for it to reach its true potential. We believe that by letting players experience the main content of Dyson Sphere Program and actively interacting with them to collect their feedback will allow us to improve the game and make it much better than it would be without this Early Access stage. Our plans are for this EA stage to be about 1 year long. But that is not written in stone\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\u25c7 Build a galactic industrial empire from scratch: start with a small workshop and improve it until it spans the whole galaxy\n\u25c7 Develop your very own Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that orbits\naround a star harnessing all its power and energy, from the first screw\nto its completion\n\u25c7 Explore a vast universe procedurally generated with all kinds of celestial bodies: neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants\u2026\n\u25c7 Gather resources in planets of all types: ocean, lava, desert, frozen,\ngaseous planets\u2026\n\u25c7 Research new technologies to improve your factories\u2026 and discover\nthe secrets of the universe\n\u25c7 Build mechas to fly, sail or jump through outer space and alien planets\n\u25c7 Transport materials across the galaxy to your facilities: thousands of\ntransport ships will flow endlessly to your factories and back!\n\u25c7 Design the most efficient automated factory and production line\n\u25c7 Customize your factory and Dyson Sphere to make it unique\n\u25c7 Design a balanced power network, producing energy in all kinds of\npower plants like wind turbines, artificial stars\u2026 through conveyor\nbelts, and you\u2019ve got technology to help your buildings fit the grid automatically during the construction process. You\u2019ve got the best tools\nCOSMO can afford to build a massive-scale automated production line\n\nBACKGROUND MUSIC\n\"Synthwave\" from StreamBeats by Harris Heller.

That\u2019s particularly useful in a court of law, where we almost never have all the facts we need. But what happens when bad math makes an uncertain situation even worse? In this case, people go to prison. And all it took was the misapplication of the product rule.\n\nBy inventing a series of probabilities and pretending that they were independent, a Los Angeles prosecutor ruined the lives of Janet and Malcolm Collins. A complex situation involving bad witnesses, racism, and prosecutorial overreach was reduced to a simple multiplication problem that never, ever should\u2019ve been a part of the trial.\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to this catastrophe, it\u2019s that the California Supreme Court used an appeal to the Collins trial to eviscerate bad math in the courtroom and lay the foundation for more appropriate uses of math going forward. From its roots as a \u201cveritable sorcerer\u201d to processing what several newspapers called \u201cTrial By Computer,\u201d the Collins probability trial has extended over 50 years of influence on legal proceeding -- and we\u2019re just getting started.\n\n*** SOURCES ***\n\nPeople v.

And now i have recovered myself from this incident and Alhamdulilah our channel is back again on its platform.This is the reason, why I am uploading my video after this long time period. This time i need some favour from you guys, share this video as much as you can on all other social media platforms so everyone would come to know that it is not easy to break us down. And with the help of Allah Almighty and support from you guys will make this youtube family more stronger than it was before. When the channel got hacked, I did not stop working i did not lose my hope, spirit and strength, this was all possible because of the love you guys always gave me. And at the end i want you to follow me on the Instagram so everyone will beware of any problem happens in future very closely.\n\n\nOverall Sword Length : 38.5 Inches\nHandle Length : 9.5 Inches\nBlade Length : 29 Inches\n\nAll the Processes are below of making this beautiful KATANA:\nForging:\n          It took me almost a week to hand forge an Iron railway track piece into a long Metal Strip and this was one of my hardest forging ever. I don't have a power hammer so i did all the forging with hands and turned a railway track piece into an almost 35 - 40 inches long steel strip.   \nGrinding:\n          I started all the grindings of long strip on my SURFACE GRINDER and turned the forged strip into a Katana shaped long steel piece. I also hand sanded the edges with the help of file to remove almost all the roughness of the sword.\n          o. I made the Blood Groove with the help of dewalt roater.\n          o. The blade bevel was made by my professional angle grinder and 2x82'' Belt grinder.\n          o. Hand Sanded the blade to remove roughness.\nHardness:\n          There is a professional way to harden a Katana and that is\n                   Covering the whole sword in a Fire Clay (Insulation) Except the blade bevel.After that we put the sword into the fire and heat it to critical temperature. We use oil to Quench the heated sword in it. Now the Bevel is hard and the remaining sword is annealed. Tempering the blade is the best way to increase the Strength, Hardness and Toughness of the sword.\nHibaki:\n           This piece is traditionally made by forging some copper or brass but we can also make it by casting these metals. And the purpose of hibaki is to hold the Sheath with the handle.\nHandle:\n           The Handle contains three parts.\n            o.    TSUBA: I made the guard by Wax casting technique and also used some black epoxy resin to make it more beautiful. Tsuba shows a partition between the handle and the remaining sword.\n            o.     Spacer: This is the little metal piece which fits on tang and controls the fittings of the whole handle so nothing should vibrate in handle.\n            o.     TSUKA: A nice piece of wood uses as a handle/ tsuka of the sword and that could be Wrapped by some soft Silk or leather strips.\n\nRusted Railway Track Forged into a Beautiful KATANA", "date": "Mar 14, 2021", "views": "47,377,667 views", "comments": "12,700", "likes": "529,862 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1017.521, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6NP10PNwrw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MKw0aiKfAY": {"title": "N909PH PIPER PA 23 160 Apache", "content creator": "baldyflier", "description": "Taken at Breighton East Yorkshire UK on the 19/07/2020\nSearch for BALDYFLIER for my other channels", "date": "Aug 17, 2020", "views": "29,455 views", "comments": "23", "likes": "281 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 23.381, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MKw0aiKfAY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKrwkY5zrLs": {"title": "Candace Owens Gets Up And HUMILIATES AOC And The ENTIRE Democrats In Congress", "content creator": "True Leaders", "description": "Watch Candace Owens get up and rip AOC and the entire Democrats to shreds", "date": "Dec 23, 2021", "views": "392,490 views", "comments": "1,885", "likes": "14,335 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 923.601, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKrwkY5zrLs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov_qaESpkOo": {"title": "Panzerfaust Vs KV-1 Tank", "content creator": "Johnny's War Stories", "description": "Tali-Ihantala 1944 / 1944: The Final Defence (Eng)\nRent or buy full movie - https://amzn.to/38ImW08\nWorld Encyclopedia of Tanks - https://amzn.to/2X0hobG", "date": "Dec 30, 2020", "views": "2,690,139 views", "comments": "2,169", "likes": "17,048 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 138.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov_qaESpkOo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoMRwyNhqJ4": {"title": "Volcanic Eruption May Be Biggest Ever Seen From Space", "content creator": "Scott Manley", "description": "In the last 24 hours we've seen a huge explosive volcanic eruption from the Tongan island of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai - the blast is so large it's easily visible from multiple satellites in geostationary orbit, tens of thousands of miles up.

There are some bushcraft skills - making a fire, harvesting chaga, preparing firewood, cooking over a fire. It turned out to be a mixed hike bushcraft - camping :)\n\nOn the first day, I could not finish building the roof of the shelter, as it took a lot of energy to get to the place through the snow-covered forest.\nI didn't have snowshoes or skis, and the snow was above the knee. Snow cover was not strong in places and fell through.\nSo I had to spend the night without her. Fortunately, there was neither snow or wind. I covered the entrance with a poncho tent and make a fire inside.\n\nOn the second day, I was finishing the igloo roof. It turned out to be not easy. I had no experience in building such a shelter as IGLOO.\nI knew only one thing about him - you need to lay out the blocks in a spiral, like the shell of a snail. Perhaps the snow was too loose and therefore it was difficult. But I closed it.\nAnd that was very helpful. By the evening of the second day, a heavy snowfall with wind began.\nI cooked on fire a piece of meat, drink hot chaga tea and went to bed.\n\nThe third day was the coldest.\nOn this day, I managed to cut down a window of ice for my snow shelter. I also made bed in igloo, covered it with fir branches. The table inside the snow hut was also carved out of ice. I also built a vestibule at the entrance. Now it has become quite comfortable and good.\nThat day I had dinner already inside my snowy forest shelter - an igloo.\n\nThe fourth and final day of my winter solo hike has come.\nI cut down the chaga, which I noticed on a birch tree near my camp, processed it and chopped it into pieces.\nI brewed tea from fresh chaga. These pieces can be brewed more than once, so I took them with me.\nGathering up, I set off on the way back.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nDisclaimer: This video is not intended to be a guide and is filmed for entertainment purposes only.

It's a man-made floating island that acts as a homestead, an art installation, and a home to Catherine and Wayne in Tofino, BC, Canada.  \nThe project started with a small float home that was built using wood that had washed ashore after a storm, and since moving into it in 1992, they've gradually added new buildings, greenhouses, and an outdoor dance floor to create a fully off-grid, floating homestead where they can grow most of their own food, earn a living as artists, and reduce their environmental footprint.\n\nThey have used as much reclaimed material as possible, including the flotation technology that has been discarded from nearby fish farms over the years.\n\nThe site where they chose to settle in was chosen specifically because it had a fresh water source above sea level so they could have gravity fed water, and because the cove provided protection from winter storms.\n\nThey use a mix of solar panels, a generator, propane and firewood for their various energy needs, and they have a new microbial wastewater system that will allow them to fully purify their waste.  Before that, they had a tank that could be emptied in open water like most boats and vessels do.\n\nCatherine King and Wayne Adams are artists and carvers who make beautiful work and showcase some of it in their floating gallery.\n\nIf you'd like to visit Freedom Cove in Tofino, BC, you can book a tour with Browning Pass here: ", "date": "Dec 17, 2019", "views": "5,618,044 views", "comments": "5,324", "likes": "110,504 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 815.881, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ts15BW-6hw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmAXxUAx7Jw": {"title": "A Little Dive", "content creator": "hippopotatomus", "description": "Dobby is still getting used to his new swimming pool.

They were the two biggest comedians at the time with similar acts that featured vulgarity and profanity. However, Kinison accused Dice of stealing his jokes.\n\nLouis CK VS Denis Leary\n\"Asshole\" is a song by comedian Denis Leary from his album No Cure for Cancer. In an appearance on The Opie and Anthony Show, Louis CK claimed that Leary stole his routine and turned into a hit song. Leary later disputed the claim, asserting that he co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.\n\nEddie Murphy VS Bill Cosby\nEddie Murphy Raw is a 1987 stand-up comedy special, during which Murphy recounted a phone call from Bill Cosby chastising him for using profanity on stage. The bit became the centerpiece of the hugely successful film. Cosby responded by calling Murphy a liar even though he didn\u2019t deny the phone call.\n\nRichard Pryor VS Chevy Chase\nIn 1977, Richard Pryor and Chevy Chase both went on the Tonight Show to plug their respective TV specials, airing back-to-back on NBC the following night.\n\nNBC\u2019s excitement and the public\u2019s anticipation over Pryor\u2019s looming special were unprecedented. During the interview, Chase\u2019s interruptive taunts from the sidelines irritated Pryor to the point of delivering the memorable blow, \u201cI don\u2019t like Chase.\"\n\nRussell Brand VS Chelsea Handler\nIt\u2019s safe to say Russell Brand & Chelsea Handler share a mutual dislike of one other. Brand\u2019s 2009 guest appearance on Chelsea Lately ignited a hilarious passive aggressive war of insults and comebacks.\n\nDave Chappelle VS Key and Peele\nSince returning from his hiatus, Dave Chappelle has taken a series of shots at the stars of Comedy Central sketch comedy show, Key and Peele, most recently at the Roots Picnic Festival in 2016.\n\nHe reportedly said about Key & Peele: \u201cPut some respect on my name. Y'all don't know what I've been through, watching Key & Peele do my show the last five fucking years.\u201d\n\n==================================\nCHECK OUT OUR SOCIAL MEDIA:\n==================================\nSubscribe: ", "date": "Jan 15, 2017", "views": "3,160,697 views", "comments": "3,818", "likes": "20,895 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 634.501, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9yea2MRUKE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIyzTgXH464": {"title": "SJWS OWNED COMPILATION #8", "content creator": "SJWCentral", "description": "Feminist Social Justice Warriors and BlackLiveMatters getting \nOWNED\n\n\nFollow Me On Twitter-", "date": "Aug 6, 2016", "views": "6,812,889 views", "comments": "8,722", "likes": "83,109 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 667.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIyzTgXH464"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiuAFIqhSJk": {"title": "Orphaned Baby Seal Barks At Anyone Who Tries To Clean Her Bathtub | The Dodo Saving The Wild", "content creator": "The Dodo", "description": "Watch this orphaned baby seal throw the world\u2019s biggest tantrum when her caretaker tries to clean her bathtub \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc99\n\nTo download a free Mutual of Omaha\u2019s Wild Kingdom calendar, visit: thedo.do/MoOYT5.\n\nTo help save more seals like Ili Pika, you can support Seal Rescue Ireland by visiting: ", "date": "Dec 22, 2021", "views": "2,570,655 views", "comments": "2,207", "likes": "77,354 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 360.641, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiuAFIqhSJk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS4D-PRFZR0": {"title": "A Challenge For Mr. Kent Hovind", "content creator": "Professor Dave Explains", "description": "While most of my viewers avoided my recent \"debate\" with Kent Hovind because their brains could not withstand the number of facepalms that would result from listening to the excrement pouring out of his mouth for more than thirty seconds, some of you managed to get through it.

Forget it. The processor wars of the 90s are almost as legendary as Sega vs. Nintendo or Amiga vs. Atari. While Intel was improving the 386 and 486, competitors popped up like AMD and Cyrix, leaving Intel with a lot more competition on their hands than today, and various lawsuits followed along the way. These companies were dedicated to overtaking Intel in the processor race, and when Intel jumped to the Pentium, Cyrix and AMD weren't far behind with 5x86 and 6x86 processor iterations (AMD with their K6). This video will explore the whole Cyrix story, from their setup to their unfortunate demise. Along the way I'll ask the important question; Did Quake kill off Cyrix? Was it the undoing of an entire processor designer?.... It's a question which has basis in the Cyrix 686 processor's poor FPU performance and John Carmack's coding which leaned heavily on Intel FPU design. But it might not be the only reason why this silicon chip designer bit the bullet. This is an era where it wasn't just Intel vs AMD, or a simple price vs performance war. This was an era of Intel vs AMD vs Cyrix vs IDT, and for me, having lived through it, it's absolutely fascinating. \n\nSit back and witness glorious CPUs like the Cyrix 5x86, the 6x86, the MediaGX and the MII series. Along with early math co-processors that helped to make early x86 machines fly father than an IBM blue lightning chip set.\n\n** For exclusive videos, mystery boxes and other rewards, please consider supporting me at; ", "date": "Sep 22, 2017", "views": "1,921,139 views", "comments": "3,543", "likes": "32,949 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2105.281, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWGAdoMz1c0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN3VFgG922A": {"title": "Meet the enormous boats that carry your stuff", "content creator": "Vox", "description": "The largest container ship in the world launched earlier this month.

Without such an advantage, it would be impossible to set the stage for D-day and the eventual liberation of France. \n\nAlthough the aircraft was fitted with one of the mightiest engines of its time, the initial results were highly disappointing. Then, as it made it to the battlefront to conduct its first operations, it further disheartened the Allied leaders. \n\nThe aircraft turned out to be very difficult and risky to operate, displaying a much higher probability of being taken down or even bursting into flames on its own than other fighters.\n\nSoon, Allied pilots started to dread the prospect of flying it, going as far as considering it a suicide mission. \n \nBut just as Germany deployed its fastest and more powerful fighter to date, the Focke-Wulf FW 190, and the prospects of maintaining air superiority over the English Channel appeared bleaker by the minute, the Hawker Typhoon and its daring pilots stepped up to meet the threat eye to eye. \n\nThen, almost by mistake, the faulty and hazardous Typhoon was given a different role, completely changing the course of the war...\n---\n\nJoin Dark Skies as we explore the world of aviation with cinematic short documentaries featuring the biggest and fastest airplanes ever built, top-secret military projects, and classified missions with hidden untold true stories.

Yet now the consensus is that he made some of the finest pop/rock recordings of his era. Sure, he had more promotional push than any other rock musician of the '50s; no, he wasn't the greatest singer; and yes, Elvis, Gene Vincent, Carl Perkins, and others rocked harder. But Nelson was extraordinarily consistent during the first five years of his recording career, crafting pleasant pop-rockabilly hybrids with ace session players and projecting an archetype of the sensitive, reticent young adult with his accomplished vocals. He also played a somewhat underestimated role in rock & roll's absorption into mainstream America -- how bad could rock be if it was featured on one of America's favorite family situation comedies on a weekly basis? \n\nNelson entered professional entertainment before his tenth birthday, when he appeared with father Ozzie, mother Harriet, and brother David on a radio comedy series based around the family. By the early '50s, the series was on television, and Ricky grew into a teenager in public. He was just the right age to have his life turned around by rock & roll in 1956 and started his recording career the following year recording a cover of Fats Domino's \"I'm Walkin'\" that went to number four. So far the script was adhering to the Pat Boone teen idol prototype -- a whitewash of an R&B hit stealing the thunder from the pop audience, sung by a young, good-looking fella with barely any musical experience to speak of. What happened next was easy to predict commercially but surprisingly satisfying musically as well. \n\nNelson was a fairly hip kid who preferred the rockabilly of Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley to the fodder dished out for teen idols, and over the next five years he would offer his own brand of rockabilly music, one with some smooth Hollywood production touches and occasional pure pop ballads. Nelson recruited one of the greatest early rock guitarists, James Burton, to supply authentic licks (another great guitarist, Joe Maphis, played on some early sides). Some of his best and toughest songs (\"Believe What You Say,\" \"It's Late\") were written by Johnny and/or Dorsey Burnette, who had previously been in one of the best rockabilly combos, the Johnny Burnette Rock 'n Roll Trio. Ricky could rock pretty hard when he wanted to, as on \"Be-Bop Baby\" and \"Stood Up,\" though in a polished fashion that wasn't quite as wild and threatening as rockabilly's Southern originators. Nelson really hit his stride, though, with mid-tempo numbers and ballads that provided a more secure niche for his calm vocals and narrow range. From 1957 to 1962, he was about the highest-selling singer in the U.S. except for Elvis, making the Top 40 about 30 times. \"Poor Little Fool\" and \"Lonesome Town\" (1958) were early indications of his ballad style; in the early '60s, \"Travelin' Man,\" \"Young World,\" \"Teen Age Idol,\" and other hits pointed to a more countrified, mature style as he honed in on his 21st birthday (by which time he would shorten his billing from \"Ricky\" to \"Rick\"). He could still play rockabilly from time to time, the most memorable example being \"Hello, Mary Lou\" (co-written by Gene Pitney), with its electrifying James Burton solos. \n\nNelson was lured away from the Imperial label by a mammoth 20-year contract with Decca in 1963, and for a year or so the hits continued, at a less frenetic pace. Early-1964's \"For You,\" however, would be his last big smash of the '60s. His country-rock outings attracted more critical acclaim than commercial success, until 1972's \"Garden Party.\" A rare self-composed number, based around the frosty reception granted his contemporary material at a rock & roll oldies show, it became his last Top Ten hit. Nelson would continue to record off and on for the next dozen years and toured constantly, yet he was unable to capitalize on his assets.  ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

It is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published and the work has no official title, so \"Meditations\" is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection. Marcus ruled the Roman empire from AD 161-180. He wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement.

He made an amazing found. He found multible items that were in a very rough condition. They almost had some kind of concrete on them and a lot of heavy rust. This little screwdriver got my attention right away. It was not clearly visible what the function of it was, but I remember that I thought it might be some kind of ratchet mechanism. At home I posted a few pics of it in my Instagram story. It didn't took long for @hand tool rescue to reply, as he has the same screwdriver, just a slightly modern version of it, but similar mechanism. After some research I found some more pics and videos online. The brand is \u201eWeltrekord\u201c made in Germany and it's called \u201eHebelschraubenzieher\u201c which meas \u201elever scredriver\u201c. The model I found was the first ever designed one from 1891. Weltrekord later made some small changes on the design. Newer ones have a small collet to clamp the insert bits and even newer ones came with plastic handles instead of wood.\nAt first I thought this will be a quick straight forward restoration project. It turned out to be a very tricky one. The most difficult part was definitely the disassembly, it took me three full days to get it in pieces. Heavy rust has done so much damage to all of the parts. Unfortunately the handle cracked when I removed it. I tried to restore it, but it became a huge mess and I decided to make a new one to have a nice and clean look. There's a 40 minutes version of this video on my Patreon page where I show how I tried to repair the handle. I had to weld up material on a lot of parts and machined and sanded it clean afterwards. That all worked perfectly fine. Some parts have still very slight pitting but overall it turned out very well. For the finish on the steel parts I decided to try nickel plating for the first time and it worked fantastic. I went with a brushed finish and with the nickel coat the parts turned out amazing. I really like the look of the nickel plated parts with the wooden handle.\n\nI hope you like my work and the video.\n\nHuge thank you to all of my Patreon and PayPal supporters and specially to:\n\n\nAdel AlSaffar\nGregory\nAlex McGeorge\nCourtney Maleport\nDavid Barker\nGreg Marston\nMellissa Marcus\nMuzaffer Aksoy\nPaul Mampilly\nVickie Bligh\nVince Valenti\nXavier Carbel\nYale Baker\nAlex Breton\nalex latzko\nAlex Shipley\nAljoscha Erlebach\nAllen Frank\nAmanda Taylor, Esq\nAndreas Mimra\nAndrew Phillips\nAnthony Adams\nArni Bjorgvinsson\naudi4444player\nBlake T\nBrian Newton\nCarlo\nChad Bryant\nChris Simondet\nCristian Zorrilla\nDre Gilley\nGrok Senften\nHarper Kim\nHunter R.\nJeremy Cole\nJessica Alexander\nJonas Richartz\nJordan Page\nJoshua Bentley\nJozette Soto\njustin f.\nKelly Imgrund\nLVE\nMarc Cerisier\nMartin R\u00f8nnow Klarlund\nMellissa McConnell\nMichael Bier\nMike Donaldson\nNick Cannon\nPasacal Schmikal\nPaul Ambry\nPerryK\nScott Marshall\nStuart Mitchell\nSuiros\nThe Carlsons\nTrevor Kam\nWarren G Strand Jr\n\uc6c5\ub85d \uc724\n\n\nTime and costs of this restoration:\n\n$5 wood for the handle\n$3 spring steel wire\n$10 vinegar for nickel solution\nI was working on this project for 2 weeks\n\n\nMy camera:\nPanasonic HC-V180\n\nI payed a lot of attention on the lighting when filming this video and also the quality of the sound to create an ASMR style video.\n\nIf you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

OK, it is geometry, but only a tiny part, that has as much to do with the modern, fast-moving discipline as conjugating a verb has to do with a great novel.\n\nIn Shape, Sunday Times-bestselling author Jordan Ellenberg reveals the geometry underneath some of the most important scientific, political, and philosophical problems we face, from the spread of coronavirus to rise of machine learning. The word 'geometry,' from the Greek, means 'measuring the world.' But geometry doesn't just measure the world - it explains it. Shape shows us how.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe to the Penguin channel: ", "date": "Dec 7, 2021", "views": "152,907 views", "comments": "172", "likes": "3,088 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 912.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oejBbQx-Sqo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=423Zvp86mn0": {"title": "Spider-Man Auditions And How The Cast Landed Their Roles", "content creator": "TheThings", "description": "Watch Tom Holland And Zendaya Audition For Marvel's Spider-Man Roles!\n\nHey The Things, today we\u2019re talking about the audition process for some of the stars of Marvel Studios\u2019 Spider-Man films. Audiences around the world have come to love Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Jacob Batalon as Spider-Man, MJ, and Ned, but things almost went differently. In fact some of your favorite performers from these films landed their roles simply by chance, while others initially auditioned to play other characters. While big-name stars like Michael Keaton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Marisa Tomei, and J.K. Simmons were always the filmmakers\u2019 first choices, they realized that they would have to have backup plans if things fell through and the actors and actresses turned down their respective roles. Another common practice was creating new versions of the characters that were different from previous incarnations of the characters in order to be more flexible with casting. Laura Harrier\u2019s Liz was initially portrayed as more of a mean girl in the comics before being changed to be someone much more kind-hearted. Tony Revolori\u2019s Flash Thompson was often portrayed as a tall, blonde-haired jock in the comics before being changed into a character that better fits the mold of modern high school. Even Jacob Batalon\u2019s Ned was originally portrayed as a co-worker of Peter\u2019s before being brainwashed and turning into the villainous Hobgoblin and was ultimately changed into Peter\u2019s lovable scene-stealing best friend. It would be hard for us to imagine any other actor or actress taking on the mantle of these characters. So grab your web shooters and get ready to swing as we look at how some of the stars of the Spider-Man franchise were cast in their roles.\n\nSubscribe: ", "date": "Jul 31, 2021", "views": "1,198,704 views", "comments": "542", "likes": "25,080 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 488.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=423Zvp86mn0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgSnv_kWy_c": {"title": "Gordon Served King Prawns & Chocolate Sauce | Kitchen Nightmares UK FULL EPISODE", "content creator": "Kitchen Nightmares", "description": "Gordon is shocked over the cooking standards in a restaurant in Spain.\n\nIf you liked this clip check out the rest of Gordon's channels:", "date": "May 1, 2020", "views": "4,760,373 views", "comments": "4,899", "likes": "56,711 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2838.461, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgSnv_kWy_c"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXsB_Wjgchw": {"title": "if adele\u2019s exes wrote a song about her", "content creator": "TMR AEP", "description": "", "date": "Nov 23, 2021", "views": "644,773 views", "comments": "636", "likes": "24,037 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 56.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXsB_Wjgchw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqLcdUo_RIQ": {"title": "Joe Rogan - Is Stoned Ape Theory BS?", "content creator": "JRE Clips", "description": "Joe Rogan and Michael Pollan on Terrence McKenna's Stoned Ape Theory.", "date": "May 24, 2018", "views": "3,177,349 views", "comments": "3,632", "likes": "51,121 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 459.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqLcdUo_RIQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5h3yTxeCew": {"title": "How to mathematically hang a picture (badly).", "content creator": "Stand-up Maths", "description": "Watch Jade's original video on Tom Scott's channel \"How Knot To Hang A Painting\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVd2...", "date": "Aug 2, 2019", "views": "363,371 views", "comments": "1,101", "likes": "12,715 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1106.061, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5h3yTxeCew"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpkmbfISfbA": {"title": "The day I fell in a crevasse", "content creator": "Edouard Bozon", "description": "", "date": "Jun 7, 2020", "views": "13,881,137 views", "comments": "21,304", "likes": "313,924 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 628.161, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpkmbfISfbA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtmmHqEnw3U": {"title": "I was paid to speedrun Cooking Mama", "content creator": "SmallAnt", "description": "Jaiden stopped by the stream and donated subs to speedrun cooking mama 2: dinner with friends.

The Bo\u00f6tes void.\nDiscovered by astronomer Robert Kirshner and his team back in 1981, the Bo\u00f6tes void, sometimes called the Great Void, is a huge, spherical region of space that contains very few galaxies. It's approximately 700 million light-years from Earth and is located near the constellation Bo\u00f6tes, which is how it got its name. The researchers originally published their surprising discovery in their paper, \"A million cubic megaparsec void in Bootes.\"\nIt is the largest void known in the universe so far.\nSoon after its discovery, astronomers began to notice just how incredibly sparse the area really was. At first, they were only able to find eight galaxies across the expanse, but further observations revealed a total of 60 galaxies. Now, while that might still seem like a lot, it would be like stumbling upon 60 mile-long objects across a region larger than the continental United States (and that's just in two dimensions). According to astronomer Greg Aldering, the scale of the void is such that, \"If the Milky Way had been in the centre of the Bo\u00f6tes void, we wouldn't have known there were other galaxies until the 1960s.\"\n\nAnother famous void is the one astronomers found in the Taurus constellation.\n\n- -\n\"If You happen to see any content that is yours, and we didn't give credit in the right manner please let us know at Lorenzovareseaziendale@gmail.com and we will correct it immediately\"\n\n\"Some of our visual content is under an Attribution-ShareAlike license.

For a domestic dog, you are their pack and family.  \nIf you\u2019re constantly pushing your dog away or ignoring them when they try to climb in your lap and give you kisses, you\u2019re not only depriving them of affection, but going against their nature. \nLetting your dog stick its head out of a moving vehicle \nAllowing a dog\u2019s head to be exposed on the road can be dangerous. Branches, rocks or other debris could collide with the animal\u2019s head. The wind also carries dust and foreign objects that could harm your dog\u2019s eyes. Ear damage is another concern. Even worse, the dog might feel the impulse to jump out of a moving car.\nGiving Your Dog Bones\nMany vets believe it just isn\u2019t worth the risk of serious injuries to give your dog a bone. Giving dogs a real bone could be deadly. The bone could shatter and puncture their esophagus, stomach or intestines. Your dog could even break a tooth, get a tongue or mouth injury, or have an obstruction that could require surgery.\nIf you\u2019d like to give your pup a bone to chew, avoid giving your pup cooked bones of any kind as they can break and splinter into tiny, sharp pieces that can cut your dog\u2019s mouth, throat or digestive organs. \nYelling when your dog misbehaves\nYelling is another thing you should never do when disciplining your canine. It doesn\u2019t work, just like physical punishment doesn\u2019t. You're just freaking out your pet. \nNot keeping your dog stimulated\nDogs need as much mental and physical stimulation as people do. Your dog not only needs exercise but they also need to be exposed to different smells, sights, and sounds. It makes their brain work better. \nChoosing the wrong collar \nAs a responsible dog owner, it\u2019s important that you choose the right type of collar for your canine. \nA Flat-buckle collar is a plain collar that snaps or buckles closed. This is a great option for dogs that don\u2019t pull on the leash, and aren\u2019t prone to slipping out of the collar.  \nIf your canine is a puller or likes to explore as far as they can reach, using a harness might be a better option. A front- clip harness in particular is an effective method to avoid leash-pulling.\nNot making socialization a priority\nDogs who aren\u2019t properly socialized will have a fear of new or unusual circumstances. This results in the release of adrenaline hormones that increase blood pressure, as well as heart and respiration rates.  \nUsing physical punishment. \nIt\u2019s important to discipline your dog but physical punishment should never be the way to do it. Reward-based training is much more effective than physical punishment. Reward based training helps build trust and strong bond between the dog and their owner. \nNeglecting breed-specific characteristics  \nSome breeds require specific grooming needs, and others have pre-dispositions to certain health issues. \nPushed-in face breeds such as Pugs, Bulldogs, Pomeranians, and Boxers are extremely prone to heat stroke due to their narrow airways and nostrils.\nSome long-hair breeds such as Huskies or Alaskan Malamute have very thick coats and need extra care if kept in tropical climates. \nBringing puppies to a dog park\nTaking young puppies to dog parks is a bad idea. First of all, young puppies don\u2019t have all the vaccinations.\nSecondly, not every dog is as friendly as your pooch. Other dogs can be aggressive towards your pup \nLeaving a Dog Alone in a Car\nNever ever leave your dog alone in an enclosed car. \nDogs don\u2019t sweat like humans, and they overheat much faster than you think. They lack the ability to cool themselves off efficiently.\nNot securing your dog in the car\nPeople use seat belts, children use car seats, so why would the case be any different for your dog. If you don\u2019t secure your four-legged friend in the car and you end up in a car accident, your dog can get seriously injured or even killed. \nUsing harsh cleaning products\nMany cleaning products used in our homes are toxic to dogs. \nAlways check the label. Any product that contains bleach or ammonia is hazardous to animals.  \nLetting Your Dog Eat Everything\nGiving dogs human food isn\u2019t good for them. Most times the food you eat are too fatty, too spicy or too salty for your canine. Make sure to avoid feeding them human food, even little crumbles from the table.\nYou Don\u2019t Take Care of Your Pet\u2019s Teeth\nLike humans, dogs need regular dental care. Their teeth are home to hundreds of bacteria and need to be brushed just like yours do. \nSkipping flea, tick, and worming treatments\nPreventive flea, worm, tick, and heartworm treatment is crucial when caring for a dog. \nOn that note, remember that heartworm disease is a serious disease that results in heart failure, organ damages, and death in pets. Take sure to get your dogs tested for heartworm infection every 12 months.", "date": "Dec 13, 2021", "views": "1,023,173 views", "comments": "579", "likes": "15,121 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 697.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSC3OMz78EQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BF7DYNR8KU": {"title": "NBA Legends And Players Explain How SCARY GOOD PRIME David Robinson Was", "content creator": "YounGala", "description": "When talking about the greatest centers of all time, you rarely hear people talking about David Robinson.

Started as deep communal conversations that revolved around life philosophies, film, art, and obviously music, the quintet soon incorporated instruments into their congregations.

It was (swear meaningfully) hard.\n\nFor my 40th birthday, my best mates gave me a self-flown joy flight in a light plane. When given the controls I headed for home. What was at first a wonderful sense of flying became a bizarre reality check, seeing so much green turning to brown in the summer heat. Most creek lines were bare, and the general lack of bushland within the giant quilt of farmland was shocking. You don\u2019t see this contrast from the ground, always seeing a tree in the foreground, or a hedgerow in the middle distance. A single big gumtree can give the impression of health, yet the area I live in is a mostly deforested farmed zone exploited for its impressive topsoil. Having tapped into the potential of a 24 hour period of life, and since I love planting trees, I decided to plant a tree a minute on a friend's dairy farm by reforesting a creekline. Low and behold, planting that many mixed trees on muddy terrain, slipping on my arse every other minute, is one of the hardest, most rewarding single days of my life.\n\n-\n\nPlanted and Directed by\nBEAU MILES\n \nProduced and Edited by\nMITCH DRUMMOND\n\nFootage by\nMitch Drummond, Chris Ord, Beau Miles\n\nFinal Sound Mix\nJAMES DOBSON\n\nProduced by\nJODI EVANS", "date": "Dec 7, 2021", "views": "502,437 views", "comments": "1,887", "likes": "36,976 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1072.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbA-hoIuHM4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujvS2K06dg4": {"title": "Roger Penrose - Is Mathematics Invented or Discovered?", "content creator": "Closer To Truth", "description": "Free access to Closer to Truth's library of 5,000 videos: http://bit.ly/376lkKN\n \nMathematics describes the real world of atoms and acorns, stars and stairs, with remarkable precision.

It didn't exactly do well as a traditional fighter/interceptor. However it eventually found some success as a night fighter and interceptor during the London Blitz.\n\nIt was designed to intercept bomber formations, fly underneath them, and then tear them to shreds with its mounted turret. Sadly it had no forward facing guns, so once Luftwaffe pilots figured out how to approach this curious aircraft it would be in trouble.\n\nThe Defiant would go on to test some of the worlds earliest airborne electronic warfare equipment, and two would be used to test Martin Baker's developing ejection seat.\n\n****\n\nProducing these videos is a hobby of mine.

PO Thornton, as Assistant U.S. Navy Advisor, along with a U.S. Navy lieutenant serving as Senior Advisor, accompanied a 3-man Vietnamese Navy SEAL patrol on an intelligence gathering and prisoner capture operation against an enemy-occupied naval river base. Launched from a Vietnamese Navy junk in a rubber boat, the patrol reached land and was continuing on foot toward its objective when it suddenly came under heavy fire from a numerically superior force. The patrol called in naval gunfire support and then engaged the enemy in a fierce firefight, accounting for many enemy casualties before moving back to the waterline to prevent encirclement. Upon learning that the Senior Advisor had been hit by enemy fire and was believed to be dead, PO Thornton returned through a hail of fire to the lieutenant's last position; quickly disposed of 2 enemy soldiers about to overrun the position, and succeeded in removing the seriously wounded and unconscious Senior Naval Advisor to the water's edge. He then inflated the lieutenant's lifejacket and towed him seaward for approximately 2 hours until picked up by support craft. By his extraordinary courage and perseverance, PO Thornton was directly responsible for saving the life of his superior officer and enabling the safe extraction of all patrol members, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\nLearn more about the American Veterans Center: ", "date": "Mar 19, 2020", "views": "636,599 views", "comments": "1,318", "likes": "11,781 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2182.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY2zv8CqLhY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzCeQqRZMuU": {"title": "The Pacific - Japanese Patrol gets Ambushed", "content creator": "American Atlas", "description": "Leckie ambushes Japanese patrol on New Britain.\n\nCopyright HBO", "date": "Dec 31, 2018", "views": "1,174,716 views", "comments": "788", "likes": "7,455 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 126.661, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzCeQqRZMuU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6UnFutP6mI": {"title": "Bill Burr Constant Shitting on Women", "content creator": "LaughPlanet", "description": "Bill Burr Constant Shitting on Women\n\nBuy Me a Pizza", "date": "Dec 3, 2020", "views": "2,580,199 views", "comments": "4,426", "likes": "79,174 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 746.501, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6UnFutP6mI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwWlamONqs": {"title": "Medieval Weapons Master Rates 11 Weapons And Armor In Movies And TV | How Real Is It?", "content creator": "Insider", "description": "Tobias Capwell is the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. Here, he reacts to 11 memorable scenes featuring medieval weapons and armor and rates them based on their historical accuracy. \n\nCapwell looks at armor and weapons within fantasy franchises, such as Sauron's armor in the battle of Orodruin in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001).  He addresses how helmets in \"The Mandalorian\" (2019) are influenced by Greek and Corinthian styles. Using artifacts from The Wallace Collection, Capwell addresses the realism of flails and maces as seen in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003). And he rates how realistic shields and swords are in \"Vikings\" (2014) and \"The Last Kingdom\" (2015). \n\nIs it possible to reforge swords, as seen in \"Game of Thrones\" (2011)? And how difficult would it be to fight in mud in full armor, like Robert Pattinson and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet do in \"The King\" (2019)? Does knightly combat look anything like \"Excalibur\" (1981), \"El Cid\" (1961), and \"Tale of Tales\" (2015)?\n\nTobias Capwell is an author, lecturer, broadcaster, and the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. He has been a horseman and martial artist since childhood, is a founding member of the modern historical jousting community, and has fought in major international tournaments all over the world. Capwell has written many books and articles on weapons, armor, tournaments, and knighthood, including \"Armour of the English Knight 1400-1450,\" \"Arms and Armour of the Medieval Joust,\" and \"Masterpieces of European Arms and Armour in the Wallace Collection.\" In 2015 he had the honor of serving as one of the two fully armored knights who escorted the remains of King Richard III from the battlefield at Bosworth to their final resting place in Leicester Cathedral.\n\nFind out more about The Wallace Collection here: ", "date": "Dec 15, 2020", "views": "2,206,838 views", "comments": "4,331", "likes": "52,626 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1290.361, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwWlamONqs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkA4OImGuBk": {"title": "Ask Professor Dave #2: Are You A Real Professor?", "content creator": "Professor Dave Explains", "description": "I get some variation of this question all the time.

The apology came hours after DPS released two hours of the trooper\u2019s body camera video.\n\nAround 1:30 a.m. Sunday, a state trooper pulled over 37-year-old Sherita Dixon-Cole on suspicion of drunken driving. She told the trooper she was coming from Downtown Dallas and heading to her fianc\u00e9\u2019s house in Waxahachie. She said she only had one drink.\n\nDuring a field sobriety test, the trooper pours out two bottles of alcohol he found in her back seat. He places her under arrest and asks her to sit in the front seat of his patrol vehicle.\n\nThat\u2019s the point when Cole said the trooper offered to let her go in return for sexual favors. But that exchange is never heard in the body camera video.\n\nCole also accused the officer of fondling, groping and sexually assaulting her on the way to jail. But those claims are also not supported by the video.\n\nHours after her arrest, well-known civil rights activist Shaun King wrote on Facebook and Twitter, \u201cThis woman was kidnapped and raped by a Texas State Trooper.\u201d King included a detailed explanation of the claims as explained by Cole and her attorney, Lee Merritt.\n\nKing's posts accusing the state trooper of sexual assault were shared on social media nearly 80,000 times. They have since been deleted.\n\nDPS responded to the accusations late Tuesday night by releasing the video in full. The only parts that were blurred or rendered inaudible were those where personal identification information is shared. That information is considered confidential by a state statute, DPS said.\n\n\u201cThe Department is appalled that anyone would make such a despicable, slanderous and false accusation against a peace officer who willingly risks his life every day to protect and serve the public,\" the department said.\n\n\n\nCole\u2019s attorney apologized early Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply troubling when innocent parties are falsely accused and I am truly sorry for any trouble these claims may have caused,\u201d Merritt wrote on Facebook.\n\nMerritt said he does not believe the video from DPS was edited or tampered with in any way. He watched it in full and does believe the trooper acted professionally during the stop and the arrest.\n\nFOX 4 News is a FOX-owned station serving Dallas-Fort Worth and all of North Texas.", "date": "May 23, 2018", "views": "2,528,029 views", "comments": "12,511", "likes": "49,835 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 148.241, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJJ54ZL_uH4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25i7dUrqeM4": {"title": "The Best (& Worst) Interlocking Tattoos | Ink Master", "content creator": "Ink Master", "description": "Interlocking tattoos can be tattooed on one person or multiple people, but in the end, they need to depict one complete image.

I also have a few thoughts on how the reactions to it have changed over time, and why the video\u2019s comments will remain off.\n\nFirstly, while editing the video, I cut the first sentence of the script. That sentence didn\u2019t seem to add anything, and I\u2019m a believer in \u2018don\u2019t bore us, get to the chorus\u2019. That would have been fine \u2014 if only the script didn\u2019t refer back to that first sentence later on, noting that the viewer probably didn\u2019t notice the singular they in it.\n\nThere used to be an annotation explaining that mistake, but YouTube\u2019s deleted all annotations now. I regret the error.\n\nSecondly, I mentioned that recently-coined gender-neutral prounouns (hir, xe, etc) haven\u2019t caught on in regular usage, and that trying to deliberately add new words into a language is extremely difficult. I think that\u2019s true, but my tone was a bit too dismissive \u2014 there was an implied value judgment there. I\u2019d rephrase that in a second video.\n\nAnd finally, I co-opted a couple of LGBT slogans, both in the title of the video and the video itself. Those aren\u2019t my slogans to rewrite, and adding \u2018with apologies to\u2019 in the reference line isn\u2019t a great way of solving that. Looking back, I\u2019m uncomfortable with those.\nChanging times\n\nIn 2013, the video was uncontroversial. You can see that in this chart of likes and dislikes over time from YouTube\u2019s analytics tool:\n\n[graph available on ", "date": "Jul 5, 2013", "views": "3,094,116 views", "comments": "3,520", "likes": "176,146 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 228.041, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ehrFk-gLk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP4x4p-ON9Y": {"title": "Doctor Reacts To Family Guy Medical Scenes", "content creator": "Doctor Mike", "description": "I\u2019ve reacted to The Simpsons and South Park medical scenes, so next up is Family Guy!

What they found was the true horror and crimes of Hitler's Third Reich, and one of the first concentration camps set up was also was one of the last ones to be liberated. Inside of Dachau Concentration Camp, around 188,000 people passed through the barbed wire fences, and dozens of thousands were killed inside of the camp. Disease was rife, and thousands were dying of starvation with the SS guards also executing prisoners and beating them terribly. When the US Army liberated Dachau, they saw a true hell on earth.\n\nDeath and disease was everywhere, as were the thousands of corpses which had been simply just left by the Germans. However whilst liberating, the US Army captured a large number of the SS guards who worked at the camp. But during the liberation, it's claimed that in brutal reprisals for the shocking treatment of prisoners, US Army staff carried out executions and killings of the German SS Prisoners of War to enact some immediate justice for the prisoners of Dachau. There's accounts of German soldiers being killed by machine gun fire, and by other US Army Officers who took justice into their own hands. \n\nThe Dachau Liberation Reprisals its predicted were responsible for the killings of up to 50 SS guards and staff who worked at the concentration camp. Some of the guards were also killed by liberated prisoners who beat them to death with any weapon the could find. An official investigation was ordered after the war to uncover what occurred during the Liberation of Dachau, and more stories of reprisals were discovered. \n\nSo join us today as we look at, 'The BRUTAL Executions Of The Dachau Liberation Reprisals.'

First person shooters like Doom focused exclusively on gunning down monsters. Role-playing games like Ultima epitomized inventories and statistics. And stealth games like Thief prioritized sneaking through the shadows above all else.\n\nEvery now and then, an experience like System Shock or Strife would come along, and challenge the medium\u2019s self-imposed rigidness by melding multiple genres together. Yet many would argue that it was only after the release of Deus Ex that the idea of a genre-bending game became truly popular. The brainchild of Warren Spector, Deus Ex allowed players to make their way through a cyberpunk rendition of the year 2052 using a wide variety of different mechanics and playstyles, allowing for an uncountable number of solutions to its life-like quagmires. The experience that it provided was as stupendous in its execution as it was difficult to quantify \u2013 so much so, that it would single-handedly usher in the term \u201cImmersive Sim\u201d to describe all prior and future games that would be included in its lineage.\n\nCountless developers would incorporate Deus Ex\u2019s most salient aspects into their craft in the wake of its release, and many would reap the benefits of doing so for years to come. Yet Deus Ex\u2019s own developers would struggle to fully capitalize on their opus\u2019s success, producing only a single, underwhelming sequel in the years that would follow before being scattered to the wind. \nA passionate team based in Montreal would eventually take up the series\u2019s mantle, and release a respectful reboot over a decade after the first game\u2019s debut. But in the end \u2013 despite following up said reboot with a solid sequel \u2013 the team would be forced to focus its efforts elsewhere, and the series would go dormant once more.\n\nThis is the rise and fall of Deus Ex.\n\nCHAPTERS", "date": "Aug 10, 2021", "views": "247,229 views", "comments": "1,794", "likes": "13,608 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1907.601, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esMvEfCJQhA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d4wjNDGMZE": {"title": "This Crab Can't Swim, But Has To Lay Its Eggs In The Sea... | Nature's Biggest Beasts | BBC Earth", "content creator": "BBC Earth", "description": "The robber crab has been ashore so long, it's developed lungs that can no longer breathe in water.\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/BBCEarthSub ", "date": "Dec 5, 2021", "views": "1,575,327 views", "comments": "1,184", "likes": "21,786 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 259, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d4wjNDGMZE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GORKcOzd4o": {"title": "Joy Reid: Oath Keepers Went From Anti-Government To Pro-Government With Trump\u2019s Election", "content creator": "MSNBC", "description": "Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes is facing up to twenty years in prison and is charged with seditious conspiracy, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, and more.

Stay tuned for future videos to find out how much profit we made from unboxing and flipping this Amazon returns pallet!\n\nSarah has been following the Facebook group of a pallet liquidator in our area who buys truckloads of Walmart, Target, and Amazon returns and then sells them by the pallet to resellers. Since we love flipping furniture we thought it would be a unique opportunity for us.  \n\nReselling Amazon returns can be a great side hustle if you know how to list, sell, and ship items on eBay and Facebook. We have learned a lot through experience and hope you find these videos helpful and informative!

Man these Disney+ TV shows were a great idea weren\u2019t they? What they\u2019ve done for both Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson in just a few episodes is better than any movie appearance. I\u2019m starting to think all MCU projects should just be TV shows now!\n\nBut anyways, Episode 2 of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, finally saw the two leads meet up and start kicking butt. But there was an interesting callback to Bucky\u2019s past, specifically with his time in Wakanda. He mentions how he went by the White Wolf and that immediately opened the door for further speculation. In Avengers: Infinity War, T\u2019Challa called Bucky the White Wolf, seemingly setting up a new storyline for the former Winter Soldier, but that was soon dropped. Could we see Bucky actually return to Wakanda in the future to take up the White Wolf moniker again? It actually seems like a pretty good possibility! But just who exactly is The White Wolf in the comics? Would you believe White Wolf is actually the name of one of Black Panther\u2019s biggest enemies? Once you know the backstory, the whole picture becomes much clearer!\n\nSo go ahead and check out today\u2019s video all about White Wolf and Bucky Barnes. I\u2019ll talk about Bucky\u2019s past and what his future might hold so check it out! Once you\u2019re done, be sure to hit that big like and subscribe button for more awesome MCU content like this.

Should it be?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to complain about overreliance on special effects, but for projects that require impossible-to-film environments or have incredibly expensive shots, how do you get the flexibility of green screens without the drawbacks?\n\nCharmaine Chan has worked on one of the possible answers. Vox's Phil Edwards spoke to her about her career and how it's at the forefront of a big technological shift. As a compositor for venerable effects house Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), she\u2019s worked on films like The Last Jedi, assembling various digital elements into a beautiful, seamless image. Her job changed on The Mandalorian, one of the first shows to use ILM\u2019s upgrade for the green screen: LED panels that used video game engine technology to place a realistic-looking world behind the actors.\n\nIt was a huge improvement, because green screens actually have a lot of drawbacks. Removing the green screen is never as quick as visual effects artists would hope. It also casts green light upon the set and actors. Even substitutes for a green screen, like projecting an image onto a screen behind the actor, fail to dynamically respond to camera movements the way they would in the real world.\n\nILM\u2019s solution fixes a lot of those problems, and it also led to creative breakthroughs in which the old Hollywood order of a TV show or movie, in which VFX came last, was suddenly reversed. Now, artists like Charmaine are alongside actors, set designers, and other crew members during filming. That collaboration means that this technology doesn\u2019t just eliminate a screen \u2014 it eliminates a creative barrier.\n\nWatch the above video to see how it happens.\n\nSubscribe to our channel!

What is it? And where can we find it?\n\nWell, in the United States, old-money is synonymous with the American aristocracy. An elite upper class of individuals for whom money has been in the family for generations. \n\nAs the northeast is the birthplace of America, it is also the part of the country with the oldest money. In other words, there\u2019s a good chance that a number of today\u2019s aristocrats are the actual descendants of the original families who founded their particular community. \n\nAnd where can we find these communities? \n\nWell, that\u2019s what this video is all about!\n\nToday we\u2019re diving into those upscale communities scattered throughout the northeast that may not necessarily be the richest in the nation. However, when you come across them, you know you\u2019re looking at old money.\n\nSo without further delay, here are the top 10 old money communities in the northeast.\n\n*********\n\nPHOTO ATTRIBUTIONS\n1. \u201cGreenwich Municipal Center Historic District, Connecticut\u201c by Kenneth C.

We've come a long way in our research, but everything we know, all the stars, planets, and galaxies visible today, make up only 4 to 5% of the universe. The universe that we are exploring is unveiling weird objects to us as we move away from the earth. With the help of voyagers, we are farther from the earth and sun than pluto and even entered the interstellar space, discovering the strange space. However, when the voyager continued on its way to the interstellar, it came upon a weird object or barrier that had never been seen anywhere else in this universe before. The scientists are curious to know what that boundary is. Is it protecting our solar system Or is it protecting some other strange world? Welcome to Cosmos lab, your one station for all the news from space. Join us in today\u2019s video to find out about the weird boundary in space.\nIn November 2018, NASA's Voyager 2 accomplished a milestone of exploration by becoming only the second spacecraft ever to explore interstellar space, some six years after its twin, Voyager 1, made the same transition, billions of miles from Earth. Scientists have disclosed what Voyager 2 witnessed as it passed through the intergalactic space, providing new insight into some of our solar system's biggest mysteries.\nIn late 2019 voyager 2 explored a strange boundary between the heliosphere and interstellar space. As the probe continues its voyage, scientists hope to discover more about interstellar space and the remainder of the Milky Way galaxy. Following the probe's entry into interstellar space, scientists examined data obtained throughout the probe's journey from the Sun's major sphere of influence into the emptiness between stars known as the interstellar medium.\nThe heliosphere is the region of space that encompasses the solar system and is influenced by solar winds. The heliopause is the heliosphere's outer boundary, and interstellar space lies beyond it. Solar winds and the magnetic field of the sun are unable to reach interstellar space.\nAs the Voyager left the solar system, scientists got the chance to learn more about the edge of the solar system and the mysterious boundary that separates it from the rest of space. According to a team lead by Edward Stone, a professor of physics at Caltech and project scientist on the Voyager programme since its start in the 1970s, Voyager 2 identified a previously unknown barrier just outside the heliopause.\nThis threshold is called \"cosmic ray boundary layer\" by the researchers because it indicates where the probe encountered a shift in the gradient of cosmic rays from beyond our Sun and lower-energy particles typical of our Sun's familiar environment.\n\nvoyager 2, voyager, voyager mission, voyager discovery, voyager discoveries, space, space telescope, nasa\nThe heliopause is a region that resembles a big bubble and is located around 11 billion miles from the sun. It is the heliosphere and interstellar space's dividing line. The heliopause, on the other hand, isn't a thick, impenetrable barrier. It's more of a porous boundary that permits some particles to get through. Because the boundary allows particles to enter and exit the region, a mix of heliosphere and interstellar space particles is created. Voyager 1 data revealed interstellar particles entering the solar system, whereas Voyager 2 data revealed solar particles leaving. Although Voyager 1 and 2 have expanded knowledge about the heliopause, many questions remain, such as the shape of the region.\nAccording to the researchers, \u201cThere appear to be cosmic ray boundary layers on both sides of the heliopause, with the outer one only being evident at the position of Voyager 2. This cosmic ray boundary layer on the outside of the heliopause was not evident at the place and time where Voyager 1 crossed it.\u201d\nAccording to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, when Voyagers 1 and 2 left the solar system, there was a rapid dropoff in solar particles and a significant rise in galactic radiation. It's unclear why the probes ended up on opposite sides of the heliopause, passing through these layers. It could be related to the Voyagers' divergent paths, with Voyager 1 exiting the heliopause in the northern hemisphere and Voyager 2 escaping from the southern hemisphere.", "date": "Jan 2, 2022", "views": "129,552 views", "comments": "174", "likes": "2,609 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 559.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzsMt0Z4G_M"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSXqO7VPKuk": {"title": "Home Depot Fights Shoplifting With New Technology", "content creator": "Inside Edition", "description": "The outbreak of brazen smash-and-grab robberies and shoplifting is showing no signs of stopping, but some stores are taking extreme measures to stop would-be thieves in their tracks, including Home Depot.

They are known for their oyster bar and New England style seafood. In this video we\u2019re getting a first hand look at Union Oyster House, the back end kitchen, and the legendary oyster bar!\n\nFirst of all, I love the old building that actually dates back to way before Union Oyster House opened. There are so many stories that have come out of the amazing building. Union Oyster House opened in 1826, and when you arrive it\u2019s a total step back in time, a living museum that\u2019s a restaurant. \n\nAs you enter Union Oyster House, probably my favorite part of the entire restaurant is the oyster bar, which is the original oyster bar. It wasn\u2019t a seating oyster bar, but rather a leaning oyster bar. And it happened to be a favorite of Daniel Webster who would lean at the bar and eat no fewer than 6 dozen oysters. The oysters were phenomenal, so fresh and local, and with a squeeze of lemon and a swipe of horseradish and cocktail sauce. It was some of the best cocktail sauce I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nAfter taking a full tour of the restaurant we then sat down for a full meal including clam chowder, more oysters, broiled haddock, shrimp with a tomato pesto sauce, and one of my favorite dishes, mussels in white wine, garlic and garlic. The food was fresh and local and prepared in classic New England style. The clam chowder is one of the best I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nUnion Oyster House is an iconic restaurant, it has unparalleled history in the United States, and food is quite delicious - especially the oysters and the clam chowder! When you\u2019re in Boston, for both food and history lovers, it\u2019s a must.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: ", "date": "Sep 4, 2021", "views": "2,050,235 views", "comments": "2,747", "likes": "50,365 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1456.821, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc50OGXatuQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxV2-ln_BCs": {"title": "Ambulance CHALLENGE | Top Gear", "content creator": "Top Gear", "description": "With their custom made ambulances Clarkson, Hammond and May are all given the task of completing a medical procedure whilst The Stig drives them round the test track.

In a few short sentences, it outlines two diametrically opposed modes of being -- both responses to the emergence of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil detailed in story of Adam and Eve. \n\nCain's mode of being -- resentful, arrogant and murderous -- arises because his sacrifices are rejected by God. This means that his attempts to give up something valuable in the present to ensure prosperity in the future are insufficient. He fails, in consequence, to thrive, as he believes he should, and becomes bitter, resentful and murderous.\n\nAbel's mode of being is characterized, by contrast, by proper sacrifice -- by the establishment of balance between present action and future benefit. This ensures his personal and social success, accruing over time. Unfortunately, it also makes him the target of Cain's malevolence.\n\nThis great short story is relevant personally, on the level of the family, and politically, all with equal force, all simultaneously. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

Its many rooms chart Henry VIII's decline from fit young warrior to bloated womanizer, and they tell the vivid stories of the ladies who became his queens. Later, King William III and Queen Mary II commissioned Sir Christopher Wren to rebuild Hampton Court, demolishing half of the red brick Tudor palace and replacing it with an exquisite Baroque castle, making Hampton Court one of the most unique palaces in the world.

This era followed the Renaissance music era, and was followed in turn by the Classical era. Baroque music forms a major portion of the \"classical music\" canon, and is now widely studied, performed, and listened to. Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Pachelbel.\n\nThe Baroque period saw the creation of common-practice tonality, an approach to writing music in which a song or piece is written in a particular key; this kind of arrangement has continued to be used in almost all Western popular music. During the Baroque era, professional musicians were expected to be accomplished improvisers of both solo melodic lines and accompaniment parts. Baroque concerts were typically accompanied by a basso continuo group (comprising chord-playing instrumentalists such as harpsichordists and lute players improvising chords from a figured bass part) while a group of bass instruments\u2014viol, cello, double bass\u2014played the bassline. A characteristic Baroque form was the dance suite. While the pieces in a dance suite were inspired by actual dance music, dance suites were designed purely for listening, not for accompanying dancers.\n\nDuring the period, composers and performers used more elaborate musical ornamentation (typically improvised by performers), made changes in musical notation (the development of figured bass as a quick way to notate the chord progression of a song or piece), and developed new instrumental playing techniques. Baroque music expanded the size, range, and complexity of instrumental performance, and also established the mixed vocal/instrumental forms of opera, cantata and oratorio and the instrumental forms of the solo concerto and sonata as musical genres. Many musical terms and concepts from this era, such as toccata, fugue and concerto grosso are still in use in the 2010s. Dense, complex polyphonic music, in which multiple independent melody lines were performed simultaneously (a popular example of this is the fugue), was an important part of many Baroque choral and instrumental works.\n\nThe term \"baroque\" comes from the Portuguese word barroco, meaning \"misshapen pearl\". Negative connotations of the term first occurred in 1734, in a criticism of an opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau, and later (1750) in a description by Charles de Brosses of the ornate and heavily ornamented architecture of the Pamphili Palace in Rome; and from Jean Jacques Rousseau in 1768 in the Encyclop\u00e9die in his criticism of music that was overly complex and unnatural. Although the term continued to be applied to architecture and art criticism through the 19th century, it was not until the 20th century that the term \"baroque\" was adopted from Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin's art-history vocabulary to designate a historical period in music.", "date": "Oct 25, 2017", "views": "5,574,101 views", "comments": "1,556", "likes": "45,969 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 21155.101, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gfIDSreaV0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lgwTHMz4XU": {"title": "What do you really want?", "content creator": "NikTek", "description": "Probably an RTX 3090 Ti now so I could game at 8k in Among Us\nHey You, Wanna Connect with me?

This is one of the reasons why older people are richer than younger people, it's because they have a larger social network. To develop reliable reciprocal relationships. \nGive us a thumbs up and subscribe to our channel if you like this video. Thanks for watching!\n\n\nAbout the video: The following describes what has been done in making this video. First, we decide on the topic of our video. Second, we listen to the relevant lectures, interviews, and Q&As that contain the necessary audio to cover the chosen title. Then the audios are trimmed and merged to make one audio which is then edited to improve audibility. We do our best to preserve the context of these audios to avoid misinterpretation and misunderstanding. We, also give the context of the video above. We then add background music that can march the tone of the information. Relevant stock footage is added to provide a visual perception of the information. Our footage is licensed through Envato Elements, Artgrid, Filmpac, and Storyblocks. Thereafter we add different transition effects between footages to make the video seamless and cinematic depending on the tone. For strong messages we make text effects using after effects to emphasize these points. The final part is to write subtitles for the whole video and to give it a good font and font size. The video is then exported and uploaded.\nWe finally make our thumbnail using Adobe photoshop which involves using different layers of images, text, and solid colors.\n\nSpeaker: Dr.Jordan B Peterson\n                : Lewis Howes\n\nlink to the full interview:", "date": "Sep 6, 2021", "views": "915,239 views", "comments": "434", "likes": "32,361 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 728.221, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpAp1YNbuGg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsVJ8PCV-0M": {"title": "\u2605 4K Cab ride \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddedSt. Moritz - \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9Tirano, fresh snow, strong winds & snowdrifts [03.2020]", "content creator": "lorirocks777", "description": "Welcome to the second cab ride along the world famous, heritage listed Berninanahn (Bernina railway), this time in 4K 60 frames per second quality - and during winter.

Jussie claims he was jumped and assaulted by two Donald Trump supporters, in the early morning hours of January 29, 2019, right outside his Chicago apartment (North Water Apartments). Initially, the media (CNN, TMZ, Fox News, MSNBC), Hollywood (Ellen Page, Lee Daniels, The View, The Talk, The Real), and presidential candidates (Cory Booker, Kamala Harris) gave Jussie an outpouring of support and seemed to have condemned Trump Make America Great Again (MAGA) supporters.\n\nHowever, after an elaborate investigation, police (Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson) believe they have irrefutable evidence that Jussie Smollett is not a victim, but a perpetrator filing a false police report on a fake hate crime attack to gain publicity so he can demand a higher salary on his TV show. Despite all the police evidence against Jussie, including his \"attackers\" (Abel and Ola Osundairo) cooperating with Chicago Police, Jussie is still claiming his innocence. So we\u2019re going to investigate by reading his body language during this famous Good Morning America (GMA) interview with Robin Roberts, and using police evidence, to determine if Jussie Smollett is lying.\n\nIf you think Jussie Smollett is guilty of staging the attack, give this video a thumbs up.\n\nIf you think Jussie Smollett is not guilty, then give this video a thumbs down.\n\nIn the comments: what punishment, if any, do you think Jussie Smollett should receive? Let everyone know in the comments below.\n\nRemember to subscribe for more body language and investigative videos and I\u2019ll see you at the top.\n\nMENTIONED POLICE BODY CAMERA VIDEO:\nWatch How Police Caught Chris Watts, Family Murderer, With Body Language - Police Body Cameras", "date": "Feb 28, 2019", "views": "2,168,388 views", "comments": "19,094", "likes": "60,763 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2002.781, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH7IalJyMjk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O49t9SuIyXM": {"title": "Shapiro Reacts to TikTokers Acting Like Dogs", "content creator": "Ben Shapiro", "description": "TRY NOT TO CRINGE: TikTokers Acting Like Dogs #Shorts #TikTok #TikTokReaction #BenShapiro #BenShapiroReacts #Shapiro #React #Reaction", "date": "Dec 27, 2021", "views": "346,267 views", "comments": "2,025", "likes": "24,184 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 56.981, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O49t9SuIyXM"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lknCE7fn7k8": {"title": "Bettie Page a killer??

The state collects massive amounts of data from willing citizens: the benefits are practical, and people who play by the rules are rewarded.\n\nCritics call it \"the most ambitious Orwellian project in human history.\" China's digital surveillance system involves massive amounts of data being gathered by the state. In the so-called \"brain\" of Shanghai, for example, authorities have an eye on everything. On huge screens, they can switch to any of the approximately one million cameras, to find out who\u2019s falling asleep behind the wheel, or littering, or not following Coronavirus regulations. \"We want people to feel good here, to feel that the city is very safe,\" says Sheng Dandan, who helped design the \"brain.\" Surveys suggest that most Chinese citizens are inclined to see benefits as opposed to risks: if algorithms can identify every citizen by their face, speech and even the way they walk, those breaking the law or behaving badly will have no chance. It\u2019s incredibly convenient: a smartphone can be used to accomplish just about any task, and playing by the rules leads to online discounts thanks to a social rating system. \n\nThat's what makes Big Data so attractive, and not just in China. But where does the required data come from? Who owns it, and who is allowed to use it? The choice facing the Western world is whether to engage with such technology at the expense of social values, or ignore it, allowing others around the world to set the rules.", "date": "Oct 17, 2021", "views": "1,774,040 views", "comments": "7,035", "likes": "23,802 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2546.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gSU_Xes3GQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRgeQvQooSA": {"title": "#BREAKING: Tsunami Advisory for the West Coast After Undersea Volcanic Eruption Near Tonga", "content creator": "NBC Bay Area", "description": "A tsunami advisory is in effect for the all coastal areas of the Bay Area as well as the entire West Coast.

Today, he\u2019ll give you the inside scoop on owning a laundromat that he opened just before the pandemic.\n\nBusiness partners Justin Pike and Mike Cox opened Ferndale last December. In retrospect, it seems like an inopportune or unlucky time to start a laundry business. But by focusing on their community instead of a quick payoff, their business is growing every day.\n\nIn part 1 of our interview, Justin will tell us how they\u2019ve built their business during a pandemic and let us know how a business can team up with local agencies to help their growth and the community at the same time.\n\nWe\u2019ll learn all about Justin and Mike\u2019s background and about some of the ups and downs associated with a business partnership.\n\nJustin will share his advice on choosing a location for a coin laundry business, how to research the market, and provide insights on financing a laundromat.\n\nHe\u2019ll also explain what it means to retool a location in the automatic laundry industry\u2014which generate around $5 billion in annual revenue nationwide.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to know how to grow a business during a down market and when things are out of your control, this is an interview you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nEntrepreneurs who love stores about overcoming the odds should take note and learn something valuable from this interview.

Acorn and Pumpkin were having another noisy fight. Usually this stops with aggressive sounds like teeth chattering, but today Acorn was ready to attack to defend her food. Despite being a small pig, she mustered a mighty jumping bite that can only be witnessed in super slow motion. Pumpkin never saw it coming.\n\nIn response, Zucchin decides it's time to flee, taking an entire leaf for herself. Butternut just seems confused as usual.\n\nDon't worry, the pigs are OK and getting along since their fight! If anything, Pumpkin is just embarrassed she got tackled in front of the whole herd. Guinea pigs have minor fights while bonding to establish dominance and set the pecking order. Acorn is growing and getting stronger so she's restarting old fights to advance in the pig rankings.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S PIGS?\n\nWe publish daily highlights of the adorable antics of our guinea pig herd. Subscribe to see what they do tomorrow!\n\nIn June 2019 we adopted five pigs from Los Angeles Guinea Pig Rescue. They are cute herbivorous pets with funny social interactions. We film all their behaviors, from cute guinea pig noises to eating sounds, playing with their food to sleeping with their eyes open, and occasional fighting. So far they have been most popular for their loud wheeking and rumblestrutting and their ridiculous guinea pig fights!\n\nOur videos generally have no talking so they're great in any language, whether you search for guinea pigs as cobayos, conejillos de indias, cochons d'Inde, meerschweinchen, mor\u010de, marsvin, cavia, marsu, tengerimalac, marmot, porcellino d'India, cobaia, gine domuzu, chu\u1ed9t b\u1ea1ch, \u015bwinka morska, \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430, \u062e\u0648\u06a9\u0686\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u062f\u06cc ,\u062e\u0646\u0632\u064a\u0631 \u063a\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0627, \u8c5a\u9f20, \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8, \uae30\ub2c8\ud53c\uadf8, or \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39\u0e15\u0e30\u0e40\u0e20\u0e32!\n\nMEET THE PIG FAMILY\n\nSpaghett is the boar of the herd. The rest of the pigs are females, but he\u2019s a neutered male so they won\u2019t be breeding. Sorry, no pregnant or baby guinea pigs! Spaghett has orange-brown fur with a white crest on his head and cute red eyes. He goes on morning romps with entertaining popcorning and zoomies. He does a hilarious rumblestrutting dance for the ladies while purring. When pigs argue he trots over to comfort them. He burrows through hay and stands on his back feet like a goofy dinosaur.\n\nAcorn is youngest so we call her little Acorn. She has white, black, and gold fur with a cute mousy face. She\u2019s inquisitive, always wants food, and talks to herself while exploring hay piles. She\u2019s always the last one eating while the others nap. Little Acorn\u2019s special talent is jumping on houses to go on rooftop adventures.\n\nButternut appears either confused or deep in thought, but we speculate she is just a very philosophical pig. She has white and gold fur. She\u2019s the lowest ranking pig so she stares into space while waiting for other pigs to move. Her hobbies include sleeping and yawning while flopped over with her feet sprawled out. She continues wheeking and squeaking at us after we have already given her food.\n\nPumpkin has black fur except for white back toes. She looks like a cow, a non-guinea pig, and a rabbit. She has noisy standoffs with little Acorn when Acorn gets too feisty. Pumpkin seems receptive to Spaghett\u2019s rumblestrutting and occasionally she chases him around instead.\n\nZucchin is oldest and grumpiest. She has white and gray fur with cute red eyes. At first Zucchin fought with Spaghett. There were teeth chattering, nose raising, and hair puffing battles. Now they get along, but Zucchin is still a grouch. Her main hobby is being an eel and lunging at anyone who comes near. She likes to chase other pigs out of their homes, then follow them to another home and chase them out of that one too. But she looks like a cute rat!\n\nTHEIR HOME\n\nThe pigs live in a custom 4 by 6 foot cage made by merging 3 MidWest Guinea Habitat cages. We cut the seams of the cage bottoms and joined them into one large cage liner. Now we have a triple size MidWest cage! The pigs first lived in the 3 cages connected by ramps.\n\nThe bedding is fleece blankets with towels underneath and newspaper on the bottom. Each day we change one third of the bedding and spot clean several times.\n\nThe pigs prefer free stuff to actual guinea pig toys. They love to hide under packing paper. A DIY guinea pig house made from a cardboard box is a favorite hidey. They are not interested in most chew toys.\n\nTHEIR DIET\n\nTheir favorite hay is 3rd cut timothy hay from Small Pet Select. They gobble up guinea pig pellets.\n\nThey eat nearly any vegetable. The only thing rejected so far was zucchini. Their favorites are parsley, kale, collard greens, kohlrabi, carrot tops and roots, beets, bell peppers, corn with the husk, and cucumbers. They go nuts for homemade wheatgrass sprouts.", "date": "Jul 26, 2019", "views": "3,034,528 views", "comments": "4,788", "likes": "84,249 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 80.841, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcAjGYky4OA"}}
