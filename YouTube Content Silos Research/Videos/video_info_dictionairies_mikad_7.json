Here, he reacts to seven memorable scenes featuring medieval weapons and armor and rates them based on their historical accuracy. \n\nCapwell looks at armor and weapons within fantasy franchises, such as Eomer's helmet in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" (2002).  Using artifacts from The Wallace Collection, Capwell addresses the realism of knightly combat in \"Henry V\" (1944), \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" (2005) and \"Game of Thrones\" (2011). Does chain mail look anything like it does in Netflix's \"Outlaw King\" (2018)? And would armor deflect arrows as in \"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\" (1999)? \n\nTobias Capwell is an author, lecturer, broadcaster, and the curator of arms and armor at The Wallace Collection in London. He has been a horseman and martial artist since childhood, is a founding member of the modern historical jousting community, and has fought in major international tournaments all over the world. Capwell has written many books and articles on weapons, armor, tournaments, and knighthood, including \"Armour of the English Knight 1400-1450,\" \"Arms and Armour of the Medieval Joust,\" and \"Masterpieces of European Arms and Armour in the Wallace Collection.\" In 2015 he had the honor of serving as one of the two fully armored knights who escorted the remains of King Richard III from the battlefield at Bosworth to their final resting place in Leicester Cathedral.\n\nFind out more about The Wallace Collection here: ", "date": "Feb 23, 2021", "views": "1,659,391 views", "comments": "1,463", "likes": "36,822 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 746.141, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3h5OlgoSc4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIdHTL18kTU": {"title": "Ori Designer Breaks Down the Awesome Sand Level", "content creator": "Game Maker's Toolkit", "description": "GMTK is powered by Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/GameMakersToo...\n\nIn the first episode of On the Level, I speak to Chris McEntee about the awesome desert world in Ori and the Will of the Wisps.\n\nPatrons can see the full interview here - ", "date": "May 12, 2021", "views": "330,338 views", "comments": "1,010", "likes": "27,747 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1108.601, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIdHTL18kTU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSStfwaOies": {"title": "Speedrunner reacts to the fastest speedrun of Breath of the Wild", "content creator": "PointCrow", "description": "Breath of the Wild has recently been proven to be beaten in just under 23 minutes.

Over the last two decades cosmologists have made remarkable discoveries: Only 4 percent of our universe is made of ordinary matter - atoms, molecules, etc. The other 96 percent is dark, in forms unlike anything with which we are familiar. About 25 percent is dark matter, which holds galaxies and larger-scale structures together and may be a new elementary particle. And 70 percent is thought to be dark energy, an even more mysterious entity which speeds up the expansion of the universe. Josh Frieman is senior staff scientist at the Fermilab and Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics and member of the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago. The Dark Energy Survey is a collaboration of 300 scientists from 25 institutions on 3 continents, which built and uses a powerful 570-Megapixel camera on a telescope in Chile to carry out a 5-year survey of 300 million galaxies and thousands of supernovae to probe dark energy and the origin of cosmic acceleration.", "date": "Jun 6, 2016", "views": "6,955,626 views", "comments": "5,402", "likes": "21,695 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 6321.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sUfiP9AUSo"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9yK1QndJSM": {"title": "Full Interview: Edward Snowden On Trump, Privacy, And Threats To Democracy | The 11th Hour | MSNBC", "content creator": "MSNBC", "description": "On the eve of his memoir 'Permanent Record' being published, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden talked at length from Moscow with MSNBC's Brian Williams in an exclusive interview.

How did we get here? How did the first living organism come about? Can it have happened spontaneously? Isn't life way too complex for that to happen? It seems ridiculous, right? Well, no. Not if you understand biochemistry, which creationists do not. But every once in a while, a hero emerges from academia to champion the cause of the creationist, and lend some illusory credence to their views. In this case, that hero is James Tour, a synthetic organic chemist who insists that abiogenesis is impossible, and he should know better than anyone, because he's a chemist. I was made aware of Dr. Tour after a couple hundred people linked me to a video of his in an empty argument from authority, insisting that because a chemist confirms their religious bias, they must be right. But is Dr. Tour a bit biased himself? Let's find out precisely what his agenda is, shall we?\n\nUpdate: James Tour responded to this single video with a dumpster fire of a 14-part series overflowing with stupidity and lies, which qualifies for the Dunning-Kruger Hall of Fame.

But the de Havilland Mosquito went on to become one of the most successful and popular aircraft of the Second World War. The defence of this bomber would be its speed. Mosquitos were among the first multi-role combat aircraft: they could be turned to anything and excelled at everything they did. They were popular with pilots and were adapted into numerous different roles to great success. In this video, our Duxford expert Graham Rodgers tells us how this little wooden bomber came into action, and we hear from some of those who experienced its power first-hand. \n\nGet tickets to Duxford\u2019s Air Show on 18 and 19 September 2021: ", "date": "Sep 8, 2021", "views": "1,231,620 views", "comments": "1,224", "likes": "25,332 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 795.101, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTsnMKzmdWs&list=RDCMUC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA&start_radio=1&rv=JTsnMKzmdWs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg": {"title": "Tucker: Actions like this threaten America's judicial system", "content creator": "Fox News", "description": "'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host makes the case for why Kyle Rittenhouse is not receiving a fair trial\n#FoxNews #Tucker", "date": "Premiered Nov 18, 2021", "views": "868,344 views", "comments": "4,641", "likes": "38,262 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 669.021, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7k2VD4iveM": {"title": "Hitman's Wife\u2019s Bodyguard On The Graham Norton Show!", "content creator": "The Graham Norton Show", "description": "To celebrate the release of the Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, here are some of the best moments of Ryan Reynolds, Salma Hayek & Samuel L.

More powerful engines, new wing shapes, different armaments, and more were added to the Spitfire in an attempt to maintain its edge over enemy aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied frontline fighter in complete and continuous development all the way through the Second World War.\n\nIWM Duxford has Spitfires from all the way through production, in fact, there are probably more Spitfires gathered together at Duxford than anywhere else in the world.

Known for his writings on the history of mathematics, Professor William Dunham will examine the genius of one of the world's most prolific mathematicians in his talk \"A Tribute to Euler\" in Hall D of the Harvard Science Center at 6 pm.\n\nAmong history's greatest mathematicians is Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), the Swiss genius who produced an astonishing 25,000 pages of pure and applied mathematics of the very highest quality.\n\nIn this talk, we sketch Euler's life and describe a few of his contributions to number theory, algebra, and other branches of mathematics. Then we examine a particular Eulerian theorem: his simple but beautiful proof that there are as many ways to decompose a whole number as the sum of distinct summands as there are ways to decompose it as the sum of (not necessarily distinct) odd summands.\n\nCondorcet, in his Eulogy to Euler, wrote that \"All mathematicians now alive are his disciples.\" It should be clear to those who attend the Clay Public Lecture that these words are as true today as when they were first set down, over two centuries ago.\n\nWilliam Dunham, who received his B.S. (1969) from the University of Pittsburgh and his M.S. (1970) and Ph.D. (1974) from Ohio State, is the Truman Koehler Professor of Mathematics at Muhlenberg College. In the fall term of 2008 he is visiting at Harvard University and teaching a course on the work of Leonhard Euler.\n\nOver the years, he has directed NEH seminars on the history of mathematics and has spoken on historical topics at dozens of U.S. colleges and universities, as well as at the Smithsonian Institution, the Swiss Embassy in Washington, and on NPR's \"Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Dunham wrote three books on mathematics and its history: Journey Through Genuis: The Great Theorems of Mathematics (1990), The Mathematical Universe (1994), and Euler: The Master of Us All (1999). In the present millennium, he has written The Calculus Gallery: Masterpieces from Newton to Lebesgue (2005) and edited The Genius of Euler: Reflections on His Life and Work (2007). His expository writing has been recognized by the Mathematical Association of America with the George P\u00f3lya Award in 1992, the Trevor Evans Award in 1997, the Lester R. Ford Award in 2006, and the Beckenbach Prize in 2008. The Association of American Publishers designated The Mathematical Universe as the Best Mathematics Book of 1994.\n\nOur thanks to the Harvard Mathematics Department for hosting this event.", "date": "Nov 22, 2011", "views": "295,328 views", "comments": "271", "likes": "4,236 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3307.241, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEWj93XjON0"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r2qGONXTa4": {"title": "Calculus 6.11 - Euler's Identity", "content creator": "Derek Owens", "description": "Euler's Identity:  e^{pi i) + 1 = 0.

How is 17 the key to the evolutionary survival of a strange species of cicada? Prime numbers are the atoms of arithmetic -- the hydrogen and oxygen of the world of numbers. Despite their fundamental importance to mathematics, they represent one of the most tantalizing enigmas in the pursuit of human knowledge. In 1859, the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann put forward an idea -- a hypothesis -- that seemed to reveal a magical harmony at work in the numerical landscape. A million dollars now await the person who can unravel the mystery of the hidden music that might explain the cacophony of the primes.\n\nMarcus du Sautoy is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Wadham College.

Try five pairs of glasses at at home, totally free: http://warbyparker.com/ragusea | Home try-ons are offered in the U.S. only.\n\n***RECIPE, SERVES TWO***\n\n1 large russet potato (or other floury variety)\n1 red bell pepper\n1 serrano or other small, hot, green chili (optional)\n1 bunch of green onions\n2 eggs\nvinegar (any kind that's not balsamic)\nharissa powder (or some combination of paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, etc)\nolive oil\nbutter (optional)\nsalt\npepper\n\nCut the potato into approx. 1 cm cubes \u2014 I don't peel the potato, but you can if you want to. Put the cubes into a pot of water \u2014 a small splash of vinegar in the water will help them keep their shape later as you fry them. Turn heat on high and par-boil the potatoes while you cook your vegetables.\n\nCut the peppers into thin slices. Cut the whites of the green onions into big chunks, and set the greens aside. Heat a nonstick (or well-seasoned cast iron) pan and drop in a thin film of oil. Cook the peppers and scallion whites over high heat, stirring constantly, until they have a little color and are starting to soften \u2014 about two minutes. Season with salt and pepper and a splash of vinegar. Dump that out on a plate and take the pan off the heat.\n\nWhen you can just barely pierce the potatoes with a fork, drain them. Return the nonstick pan to medium-high heat, drop in a film of oil and a little knob of butter. Drop in the potatoes, spread them to a single layer on the pan surface, sprinkle them with a big pinch of salt, and let them fry for a few minutes until their bottom surfaces are brown and rigid.\n\nWhile you're waiting, cut your onion greens into thin slices.\n\nStir the potatoes frequently and fry until they're as brown as you want them on all sides. If the pan surface is looking dry, you probably need to add more oil to help them fry, but you want them to have absorbed everything by the end, so add oil in conservative doses.\n\nTurn the heat off, return the vegetables to the pan and toss them with the potatoes to re-heat them. Stir some big shakes of the harissa powder (or whatever spices you want). Put divide the mixture between two plates.\n\nReturn the pan to the still-hot (but off) burner and drop in a tiny bit of oil. Gently crack in your two eggs, trying to keep them from touching each other. The eggs should bubble gently \u2014 if you don't have enough residual heat in your pan/burner, turn the heat back on low. Season the eggs lightly.\n\nWhen the white right around the yolks is just starting to turn opaque, you should be safe to gently flip the eggs with a soft spatula. Do this swiftly and with confidence \u2014 the yolks can smell your fear, and will break if they don't respect you.\n\nFor runny yolks, cook them for no more than 30 seconds on the flip side before taking them out to your plates. For medium yolks, do minute. For firm yolks, cook until the yolks feel just solid when you poke them.\n\nTop the plates with your slices onion greens.", "date": "Apr 15, 2021", "views": "790,850 views", "comments": "1,191", "likes": "28,627 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 439.761, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-39Vuw5Jtg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGR-pyLHz1s": {"title": "Why people love cast iron pans (and why I'm on the fence)", "content creator": "Adam Ragusea", "description": "Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

This is the true story of The Nazi\u2019s Temple of Doom.\n\nAlthough disappointed by the discovery that a Celtic Cauldron was in fact manufactured in the 20th Century, it soon became apparent that this mysterious item could tell us more about the intricacies of Nazi plans for Germany than has ever been explored before. \n\nThe Nazi Temple Of Doom follows the journey of how one item, found in Chiemsee Lake in Germany, revealed dark secrets about a group that were already known for their interest in Ancient Mythology and the Occult: the Nazis. Using the Nazi-made Celtic cauldron as a starting point, experts piece together the fascinating depths to which the Nazi ideology reached and explore their goals and expectations. It was long the objective of Heinrich Himmler, one of the highest members of the Third Reich and Head of the SS, to create a racially pure society in which a glorious German history was celebrated. In 1934, Himmler chose Wewelsburg Castle and its dark past as the SS base, and the beginnings of a Nazi cult, based on pre-Christian Germany, as he believed Christianity had no place in the ideology ofthe SS. \n\nThis documentary special tells the tale of how Himmler drafted in experts to research and re-write a mythological, glorious German history and to build a Nazi-Vatican. The cauldron played an integral part in furthering Himmler\u2019s cult and proving what he believed were Germany\u2019s true Celtic origins. \n\nUsing library footage, interviews and a gripping storyline, The Nazi Temple Of Doom reveals previously unexplored territory in the Nazi regime. \n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.\n\nIn this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u2019s original holy city \u2013 as detailed in the Qur\u2019an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u2019s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u2018forbidden gathering place\u2019. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.\n\nIn the film \u2018The Sacred City\u2019 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u2013 while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.\n\nWhile clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u2019s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u2019an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.\n\nIn a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.\n\nBeautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

In an obscure tomb in Thebes, she uncovers the stories of warriors who fought in the bloody battle that would eventually lead to Egypt's reunification, and reveals how settlers known as the `Hyksos' tried to infiltrate the fledgling nation's government to seize the throne.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

They settled on land that had only recently been covered by glaciers. This species, called Neanderthals, died out about 30,000 years ago -- but at one time, they formed the largest group in an area that stretched from northern France to the Belgian coast and from the Channel Islands to southern England. \n\nDuring the last Ice Age, the North Sea was frozen over -- and the English Channel was a small river that could easily be crossed on foot. The Neanderthals lived in close harmony with their perpetually changing environment. They had everything they needed to survive: the meat of prey animals, edible wild plants, water and wood for cooking and heating. How did these early humans develop over almost 300,000 years? What were their lives like before they became extinct? \n\nOur documentary is based on the latest research. We investigate various populations of Neanderthals, and visit archaeological sites in northern France, southern England, and on the island of Jersey. \n\nRenowned researchers such as the British paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer and his French colleague Ludovic Slimak describe how the Neanderthals lived, and discuss their cognitive abilities. Was this species capable of structured thinking? Did they have cultures, languages, and societies? How intelligent were they, and what sort of adaptive strategies kept them alive for 300,000 years? How similar were they to modern-day humans?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Their find set in motion a chain of events that ignited excitement across the scientific world, for if they were correct in their findings, not only would they have found the oldest human ancestor, but much of the received wisdom humankind\u2019s evolution would have to be rewritten. This programme is the story of their discovery and the implications it has for understanding of how we split from the apes. Dubbed \u201cMillennium Man\u201d by the press, he is twice as old as the most famous skeleton in the world \u201cLucy\u201d. The remarkable link between Millennium Man and humans is his ability to walk on two legs, overturning previously accepted scientific opinion on why, how and when humans began to walk. As Professor Senut who worked on the project points out, \u201cScience doesn\u2019t proceed or get better with established ideas. You have to challenge\u201d and Millennium Man seems to be challenging an awful lot of accepted science. Documentary first broadcast in 2001.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.\n\nAlbert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s. Professor Al-Khalili repeats this critical experiment, posing the question does reality really exist, or do we conjure it into existence by the act of observation?\n\nElsewhere, we explore how the most famous law of quantum physics \u2013 The Uncertainty Principle \u2013 is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis.

Warmbier was released the following year, but he died of brain damage shortly after his return to the United States. Was he really the victim of torture?\n\nOtto Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2016 after being convicted of attempting to steal a propaganda poster during a trip to Pyongyang. Just over a year on he was dead, having been sent home to the US in a vegetative state. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been \"tortured beyond belief \" in North Korea. The US president blamed both the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the Obama administration for Warmbier\u2019s death - and Trump appeared before the media with the student\u2019s parents. This was at the peak of the North Korean missile crisis. Later, as relations between Trump and Kim Jong Un became warmer, the US president changed his tune. In 2019 Trump said that he believed that Kim did not know what happened to the US student much to the consternation of Warmbier\u2019s parents. \n\nWhat really happened to Otto Warmbier in North Korea? Veteran foreign correspondent Klaus Scherer sets out to try to find out. In the documentary, Scherer interviews a number of people with knowledge of the case who have been largely unheard up to now. He shows that a US court investigating a liability case against North Korea brought by Warmbier\u2019s parents also ignored important witnesses, who continue to cast doubt on the torture allegations. These include the coroner in Cincinnati who examined Warmbier\u2019s body. She believes that the account given by North Korean doctors is credible. They claim that Warmbier had inadvertently been given too high a dose of sedatives by prison staff. This, the medics say was the cause of his state of unresponsive wakefulness. Could Trump\u2019s initial torture charges simply have been motivated by political opportunism?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Ancient Egypt was a powerful, influential, and expansionist empire that grew from the Nile River Valley to include much of the eastern Mediterranean. The civilization brought many inventions and advancements, including agriculture, art, architecture, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, religion, writing, and so much more.\n\nIn this four-part series, Professor of Egyptology Joann Fletcher examines Ancient Egypt's extraordinary rise and fall. She traces the mighty empire's humble nomadic beginnings to its zenith as prime architects and pyramid builders and, of course, its descent from worshipped pharaohs to tomb robbers and finally subjugated by the Romans.\n\nOdyssey is your journey into the world of Ancient History; from the dawn of Mesopotamia to the fall of Rome.

Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.\n\nDirected by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game?

They created a cosmopolitan world-system, with flourishing cities such as Mycenae, Hazor, Troy, Ugarit, Hattusa, Babylon, and Thebes, such as has only rarely been seen before the current day. It may have been this very internationalism that contributed to the apocalyptic disaster that ended the Bronze Age. When the end came just after 1200 BC, as it did after centuries of cultural and technological evolution, the civilized and international world of the Mediterranean regions came to a dramatic halt in a vast area stretching from Greece and Italy in the west to Egypt, Canaan, and Mesopotamia in the east. Cities and towns, large empires and small kingdoms, that had taken centuries to evolve, all collapsed rapidly. With their end came the world\u2019s first recorded Dark Ages. It was not until centuries later that a new cultural renaissance emerged in Greece and the other affected areas, setting the stage for the evolution of Western society as we know it today. \nDr. Eric H. Cline is Professor of Classics and Anthropology, former Chair of the Department of Classical and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, and current Director of the Capitol Archaeological Institute at The George Washington University, in Washington DC. A Fulbright scholar, National Geographic Explorer, and NEH Public Scholar, Dr. Cline holds degrees in Classical Archaeology, Near Eastern Archaeology, and Ancient History, from Dartmouth, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania. An active field archaeologist who is the former co-director at Megiddo (biblical Armageddon) and the current co-director at Tel Kabri, he has more than 30 seasons of excavation and survey experience in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Cyprus, Greece, Crete, and the United States. Dr. Cline has written (authored, co-authored, or edited) a total of sixteen books, which have been published by prestigious presses including Princeton, Oxford, Cambridge, Michigan, and National Geographic. He is a three-time winner of the Biblical Archaeology Society's \"Best Popular Book on Archaeology\" award (2001, 2009, and 2011). He also received the 2014 \"Best Popular Book\" award from the American Schools of Oriental Research for his book 1177 BC: The Year Civilization Collapsed, which is an international best-seller and was also considered for a 2015 Pulitzer Prize. In addition, he has also authored or co-authored nearly 100 academic articles, which have been published in peer-reviewed journals, festschriften, and conference volumes. At GW, Dr. Cline has won both the Trachtenberg Prize for Teaching Excellence and the Trachtenberg Prize for Faculty Scholarship, the two highest honors at the University; he is the first faculty member to have won both awards. He has also won the Archaeological Institute of America\u2019s \u201cExcellence in Undergraduate Teaching\u201d Award and been nominated three times for the CASE US Professor of the Year. He has also appeared in more than twenty television programs and documentaries, ranging from ABC (including Nightline and Good Morning America) to the BBC and the National Geographic, History, and Discovery Channels.\nFor more information, please visit: ", "date": "Dec 5, 2016", "views": "333,929 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00EDFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E777F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D72E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D936B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D94546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x01079622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x0112882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F723E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F71443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E7D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E8B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x76E86359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x776087A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x77608774+180]\n", "likes": "3,089 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3694.681, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppzMdQqm_6M"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1AGe2V0qHo": {"title": "Robert Ritner & Theo van den Hout | The Battle of Kadesh: A Debate", "content creator": "The Oriental Institute", "description": "The Battle of Kadesh: A Debate between the Egyptian and Hittite Perspectives \n\nThe Oriental Institute Lecture Series organized by the University of Chicago brings notable scholars from around the country and abroad as they present on new breakthroughs, unique perspectives, and innovative research applications related to the Ancient Middle East.\n\nThe Battle of Kadesh, ca. 1285 BC, is the earliest military encounter that can be analyzed in detail.  This conflict between the Egyptian forces of Ramses II and the Hittite army of Muwatalli was celebrated as a personal victory by Ramses, but is often treated by modern scholars as an Egyptian defeat or as a stalemate.  In any case, the battle had profound impact on international politics of the age, with unexpected results.  Join us for a lively debate presented from the two sides of the ancient conflict, provided by noted Oriental Institute scholars Robert Ritner, The Rowe Professor of Egyptology, for the Egyptian side, and Theo van den Hout, Arthur and Joann Rasmussen professor of Hittite and Anatolian Languages, for the Hittites.\n\nThank you for your interest in the Oriental Institute Lecture Series.

At the same time, the biblical narrative indicates that other types of interactions also were the norm. Recent excavations in Philistia, and in particular those at Tell es-Safi, biblical Gath of the Philistines, hometown of Goliath, have provided exciting evidence of the very complex interaction between these two cultures, revealing the multi-layered facets of what could be termed a Frenemy relationship between the Philistines and Israelites. In addition, recent finds have very much changed our understandingof who the Philistines were, where they came from, and how their culture formed, transformed, and eventually disappeared.

But they are also important, historically and culturally, for their illustrations of the life of Christ. These artistic representations tell tales of their own, and the visual stories are not always found in the corresponding texts. A careful examination of these images shows clearly and convincingly that medieval artists were not only familiar with the stories of the canonical Gospels, but also with many noncanonical apocryphal tales of Jesus.

This video was recorded at The Australian National University on 10 April 2012.\n\nRichard Dawkins FRS is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford. Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.\n\nHe is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.\n\nRichard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He has been awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the Nakayama Prize, the Cosmos International Prize, the Kistler Prize, the Shakespeare Prize and the Lewis Thomas Prize.\n\nLawrence M. Krauss is a renowned cosmologist and science populariser, and is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is also the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and nine books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and his most recent bestseller entitled A Universe from Nothing.\n\nHe received his PhD from MIT in 1982 and then joined the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and was a professor at Yale University and Chair of the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University before taking his present position. Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist and Scientific American and appears regularly on radio and television. He is one of the few scientists to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, and is also active in issues of science and society. He serves as co-chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and on the Board of Directors of the Federation of American Scientists.", "date": "Apr 18, 2012", "views": "2,143,778 views", "comments": "77", "likes": "17,898 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5536.341, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mljE9K-gY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wqhb-6Xwrs": {"title": "Islamic geometric patterns | Showcase Special", "content creator": "TRT World", "description": "In this special edition, Showcase takes a look at Islamic Geometric patterns.

The discovery, part of the LIGO experiment, validated Albert Einstein\u2019s longstanding prediction that during cataclysmic events the fabric of spacetime can be stretched, sending gravitational tremors across the universe.  Thorne is a graduate of Caltech and Princeton University. His research has focused on Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity and on astrophysics, and he is co-founder of the LIGO Project.  Among his many distinctions, Thorne has been awarded the Albert Einstein Medal, the UNESCO Niels Bohr Gold Medal, the Common Wealth Award for Science, and was named California Scientists of the Year.  He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Russian Academy of Sciences.  In addition to his renowned scientific research in theoretical physics, he is involved in writing and movie production. Most notably, he worked on Christopher Nolan\u2019s film Interstellar.\n\nExploring the Universe with Gravitational Waves: From the Big Bang to Black Holes\n\nThere are two types of waves that can propagate across the universe: electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves. Galileo initiated electromagnetic astronomy 400 years ago by pointing a telescope at the sky and discovering the moons of Jupiter. LIGO recently initiated gravitational astronomy by observing gravitational waves from colliding black holes. Thorne will describe this discovery, the 50 year effort that led to it, and the rich explorations that lie ahead.\n\nThe Reines Lecture Series honors Frederick Reines, UCI\u2019s Founding Dean of Physical Sciences and co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize for discovering the neutrino.", "date": "Apr 12, 2018", "views": "124,545 views", "comments": "201", "likes": "1,382 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4857.161, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxhp4GBr1Zg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygW6psCIM4": {"title": "Miscellaneous Myths: Sekhmet/The Eye of Ra", "content creator": "Overly Sarcastic Productions", "description": "Sure, you've probably gotten angry before.

This sounds like science fiction, yet it is exactly what happens in the centers of massive stars, causing them to explode so violently that they briefly release as much light as an entire galaxy. These supernova explosions have shaped the universe as we know it and created many of the chemical elements around us. It turns out that tiny, elusive elementary particles called neutrinos play a crucial role in these explosions. Only two dozen supernova neutrinos have ever been detected, but thousand more are expected to be seen in giant underground detectors of the future. This lecture describes the part neutrinos play in one of the universe\u2019s most dramatic events, and outline what scientists expect to learn by capturing bursts of neutrinos from the next galactic supernova. \n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nAlex Friedland studied physics first at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and later as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He became fascinated with neutrinos from supernova explosions while a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ. He continued exploring the rich physics of supernova neutrinos at Los Alamos National Laboratory, first as a Richard P. Feynman Fellow and then as a permanent staff scientist. In 2015 Friedland became a senior staff scientist at SLAC, where he explores neutrinos in the lab, in stars and in the early universe and pursues broader questions in particle physics and astrophysics.", "date": "Feb 1, 2016", "views": "35,369 views", "comments": "55", "likes": "346 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4551.741, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiCRTUxgwPY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMbch47oz2c": {"title": "Trope Talk: Romantic Subplots", "content creator": "Overly Sarcastic Productions", "description": "Get your copy of The Never Hero Audiobook, AND START LISTENING TODAY: https://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fan...", "date": "Mar 23, 2018", "views": "1,557,606 views", "comments": "7,956", "likes": "57,542 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 948.581, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMbch47oz2c"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p976iXeDH7w": {"title": "Lawrence Krauss about Gravitational waves", "content creator": "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute", "description": "A lecture by Lawrence Krauss about Gravitational waves at the National Technical University of Ukraine \"Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\"\nNovember 23, 2018", "date": "Nov 25, 2018", "views": "173,663 views", "comments": "810", "likes": "2,519 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5252.541, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p976iXeDH7w"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kUElZGMXm8": {"title": "Halloween Special: Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde", "content creator": "Overly Sarcastic Productions", "description": "Some monsters are undead creatures of the night.

Predictions can be made from the dynamics only if you combine the theory with QED itself, which leads to symmetry breaking which is mediated by massless bosons. The mass for these bosons has to come from an outside field, the famous Higgs field which operates via The Higgs Boson.\nThe work of Murray Gell-Mann produced Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD a theory describing the strong nuclear force that holds protons and neutrons (nucleons) together and describes how the fundamental particles inside them, the quarks and gluons, interact with each other in high energy interactions.\nFeynman's path integral method can also be used to extend Kaluza-Kelin theory to Yang-Mills theory to describe how Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD, works in the low energy regime, as running of the coupling constants for this theory becomes chaotic, like the weak interaction, at even low energies.\n\nThe question that remains: is there symmetry breaking of these gauge theories at a universal level, where all coupling constants are the same and if so why do they trend towards infinity? Is their some mass gap that must be included to achieve this? Where does gravity fit into the Standard Model? How can we renormalise the Standard Model itself? And with what?\nA lot of these questions have to be answered by the extensions of the Kaluza Klein model into the different interpretations of String Theory, which are all equivalent to M-Theory, which attempts to unify a lot of the different string theories to from a Unified Field Theory.\n\nWant to learn more about string theory and higher dimensional physics?

However, contrary to the Canberra consensus, there is going to be an intense strategic rivalry between our major trading partner and our major strategic ally. \n\nAccording to John Mearsheimer, one of America\u2019s leading foreign-policy thinkers, Washington will not let China become the dominant military power in the region without putting up a serious fight. In these circumstances, it\u2019s na\u00efve to think that Australia can sit on the sidelines and get the best of both worlds: unconstrained trade with China while keeping the U.S. security umbrella over its head. Canberra must support Uncle Sam.\n\nHowever, Australia\u2019s future will be dominated by China, says one of Australia\u2019s leading strategic thinkers Hugh White. Treasury forecasts show that the Chinese economy will be about 80 per cent bigger than America\u2019s within a dozen years. In this environment, Canberra must prepare for the new strategic terrain in the wake of America\u2019s declining leadership, and we would be unwise to support Washington in a confrontation with China that America probably cannot win.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Join in the conversation in the comments.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Like this video if you enjoyed it and want to see more, it really helps us out\n \n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe to our channel and click the bell to watch our videos first\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Missed this event live?

Using his rare aviation slides and stories as a vehicle, he tells a broader inspired story of hope, overcoming obstacles and daring to dream.\n\nShul graduated from East Carolina University in 1970 with a degree in history and anthropology. After graduation, for the next 20 years he served as an Air Force fighter pilot. During the Vietnam War, he flew 212 close air support missions. During one of these missions, Shul was shot down near the Cambodian border and was unable to eject, so he was forced to fly his plane into the jungle. He was severely burned in the crash. Shul was rescued by Special Forces and endured one year in military hospitals where he underwent 15 surgical procedures and was told he would never fly again. \n           \nAfter much physical therapy, Shul miraculously returned to active duty flying. He flew the A-7D, was an instructor in the A-10 and went on to teach at the Air Force's Top Gun School. He culminated his Air Force career by flying our nation's top secret spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, the fastest aircraft ever built. He flew covert missions in the Blackbird for four years and was the pilot who provided President Reagan with detailed photos of Libyan terrorist camps in 1986. During that time, he became the only SR-71 pilot in history to fly three missions in three consecutive days. \n  \nRetiring from the Air Force in1990, Shul pursued his writing and photography interests. He was the first pilot to write a book about flying the Blackbird, which is completely illustrated with his own photography. The book won Aviation Book of the Year honors and is today the single most popular book on that plane worldwide. He is also the only man to fly extensively with both the Navy Blue Angels and Air Force Thunderbirds as a photojournalist. \n\nThis talk was presented at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on Nov. 15, 2016.", "date": "Dec 14, 2016", "views": "551,070 views", "comments": "685", "likes": "9,350 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4256.961, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wigZsFypdyI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqdD7oi3WFY": {"title": "Jim Shelton", "content creator": "March Field", "description": "As an SR-71 pilot, Jim Shelton describes his experience and the unique features that Kelly Johnson designed into this aircraft.", "date": "Nov 9, 2015", "views": "9,027 views", "comments": "3", "likes": "107 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4707.521, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqdD7oi3WFY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb4prVsXkZU": {"title": "How to Land the Space Shuttle... from Space", "content creator": "Space Scope", "description": "NOT AN ASTRONAUT; NO AFFILIATION WITH NASA.

You waste a lot of time and resources in order to fast track leveling while spending countless pennies changing gear every 5-10 levels for that apparent \"faster leveling\" experience, ONLY to have to go all the way through the game again ANYWAY, because of the amount of skill points you missed on the way! Inevitably making your \"3-4 hour power leveling session\" actually more like a few days!\n\nPeople get to 50 fast, then start joining VETERAN queues for dungeons hoping to get those achievements and loots while performing badly because they learnt nothing along the way and don't have the skill points they need to get even HALF of their passives they intended to aim for, let alone morph anything they have. \n\nEveryone learns at their own pace and that is OK, the community is extremely helpful to new players, but the one thing that will NEVER help a new player, is rushing the learning experience.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls Online is an extremely UNIQUE mmorpg and should be approached like any NEW game you have no idea about. Load it up, start playing, and try to understand it as you go in your own time. You don't already know everything about it just because you played an mmorpg before. The only thing you have experience in is \"oooOO there are a lot of people here!\". It's a start but it is not enough ;) .\n\nNEW power leveling players, while trying to pursue that false endeavor, forget or misunderstand that the leveling process is where you gain most of your experience and ability to perform, where the content is most forgiving, AND where most of the skill points to BUILD your character generally come from. Learning mechanics you will encounter, understanding how the basics work, and getting those skill points under your belt make all the difference to the character you are creating. Your character creation is not done in the character creation screen, it is done between the levels 1-50!\n\nThere is no short cut for learning, only resources to learn from. But being PREPARED will help with your learning experience a lot!\n\nIn this guide i teach you everything you need to know about the basics of preparing a new character/player with a WIN WIN strategy for leveling both efficiently AND at a steady pace, so little work what so ever is required once you do get to that magical level 50 and/or 160cp!\n\nYour first few mins or so of building your character is what will save time LATER, and make you a better player TODAY!\n\nENJOY!\n\nTime stamps: -", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "9,293 views", "comments": "24", "likes": "261 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2444.641, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGBZGoyZcqA"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLzpzuknnfg": {"title": "Black Desert Warior Succ, Heavy strike nerf damage comparisson", "content creator": "evasel 77", "description": "", "date": "Dec 8, 2021", "views": "383 views", "comments": "0", "likes": "3 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 34.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLzpzuknnfg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pta0xwmV3Tc": {"title": "Warior vs Witch BDO Global lab Rework test", "content creator": "evasel 77", "description": "", "date": "Nov 12, 2021", "views": "8,080 views", "comments": "78", "likes": "45 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1190.921, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pta0xwmV3Tc"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxvrrK_qj5U&list=RDCMUC8nZUXCwCTffxthKLtOp6ng&start_radio=1&rv=lxvrrK_qj5U": {"title": "Kenshi - The Fantastic Open World Survival Sandbox RPG", "content creator": "SplatterCatGaming", "description": "Kenshi Gameplay with Splat!

There are three basic types of habitats that you\u2019ll encounter: arboreal, terrestrial, and aquatic.\nTree-dwelling species will need an arboreal enclosure. These tanks are much taller than they are wide, allowing you to put vines, branches, and other decorations inside for your frog to climb on. They also do better in terrariums than aquariums (all this means is you want a tank with vents at the bottom).\nLarger frogs or toads or any species that doesn\u2019t jump that high might prefer a terrestrial cage. These look like basic aquariums, and they\u2019re wider than they are tall. You can use a terrarium or aquarium for land-based frogs, but be sure to put a lid on the top so they don\u2019t hop right out.\nAquatic species live in the water.

And that is why we need a Mandela in this country.\u201d\n\u2014Nicholas Kristof, The New York Times\n\nThis event was held on April 1, 2015.", "date": "Apr 3, 2015", "views": "217,031 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00EDFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E777F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D72E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D936B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D94546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x01079622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x0112882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F723E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F71443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E7D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E8B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x76E86359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x776087A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x77608774+180]\n", "likes": "1,340 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4741.141, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWStoDveuQ8&list=RDLVYWStoDveuQ8&start_radio=1&rv=YWStoDveuQ8"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyBfOX5OHRQ": {"title": "Grace, Justice, & Mercy: An Evening with Bryan Stevenson & Rev.

Bryan Stevenson & Tim Keller will help us explore ways to sustain hope through a grace filled pursuit of justice and mercy as they draw from their own calling and work.\n\nBryan Stevenson is one of this nation\u2019s most influential public interest lawyers and the Founder & Director of the Equal Justice Initiative. For over 30 years, Stevenson has dedicated his life to help release those wrongly condemned on death row. He has also successfully advocated to eliminate the prosecution of children as adults. Leading the charge for a renewed conversation about racism in the US by connecting contemporary injustices with slavery, lynching, and segregation, Stevenson is the bestselling author of Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption.\n\n\nRev. Tim Keller has committed his life to presenting the gospel  - through preaching, teaching, and church planting - in ways that challenge not just our heads but our hearts to bring about lasting transformation. Co-founder and Senior Pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church for the last 27 years, Tim is also a prolific author.

This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.\n\nAlbert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s.

Literary texts like the Epic of Gilgamesh highlight the urban environment as the height of human development. The expansion of state power in these communities was often built around ensuring the productivity of commerce, both local and long distance, and protecting the accumulation of property. Much of this was an elite phenomenon, and these elites created the documentary record that we use to construct daily life. Commercial activity brought the communities of the ancient Near East together. This was true within communities as commerce supported the redistributive mechanisms within the early city-states and states of the region, and this was true across state boundaries as long distance trade networks arose to supply these communities with both staple and luxury goods unavailable in their local environments. The presentation will cover the mechanisms of exchange in early cities, the various goods and services that were exchanged, the ways in which communication was managed over long distances, and finally we will discuss how all of this activity shaped the development of states in early Mesopotamia.\nSteven Garfinkle is Professor of History at Western Washington University, where he has been a faculty member since 2001. He teaches a broad range of courses on the ancient world. His research focuses on social and economic history in early Mesopotamia with an emphasis on the origins of commerce and state formation. Steven is a past recipient of a research fellowship rom the National Endowment for the Humanities, and he received the outstanding Faculty Leadership Award at Western for 2015-16. He is a member of the board of directors for the International Association for Assyriology and the American Oriental Society, and he is the chair of the Committee on Mesopotamian Civilization for the American Schools of Oriental Research. Steven has authored and edited several books, including Entrepreneurs and Enterprise in Early Mesopotamia (2012), along with numerous articles. He is the editor of the Journal of Ancient Near Eastern History.\nFor more information, please visit: ", "date": "Dec 5, 2016", "views": "67,173 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00EDFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E777F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D72E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D936B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D94546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x01079622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x0112882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F723E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F71443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E7D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E8B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x76E86359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x776087A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x77608774+180]\n", "likes": "478 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 3665.561, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6l5Y8uRpGQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs5L3c40cvk": {"title": "Why Is Housing In Hong Kong So Expensive? | So Expensive", "content creator": "Business Insider", "description": "Hong Kong has the most expensive housing market in the world.

By October 1942 Singapore, Hong-Kong, Malaysia and Burma had all fallen to the Japanese; the Imperial army looked unbeatable. Yet it was then, when morale was at its lowest, that the new British commander Bill Slim set about reforming and rebuilding the Anglo-Indian British army. Slim aimed to revive Allied fortunes in the region \u2013 something many believed was an impossible task. Meanwhile, Japanese commander Renya Mutaguchi had ambitious plans of his own: the conquest of British India. \n\nTo initiate this plan the Japanese first had to capture one key strategic town: Imphal, the gateway to India. The very close-run battles that followed - fought between March and July 1944 - were clashes on epic proportions as each side attempted to execute a master plan of their respective visionary generals. If they succeeded, Slim knew the British would have a strong base from where they could commence their reconquest of Burma and quell the rise of Japan. If they failed, then the gates to all British India would be open to the Japanese army. The eventual, hard-fought Anglo-Indian victory proved the turning point in the Burma campaign and paved the way for the British-led reconquest of Burma and the eventual Allied victory in south-east Asia. \n\nIn this exclusive documentary, renowned World War Two historian James Holland sets himself the challenge of discovering the truth about the Battles of Imphal and Kohima. Accompanied by leading historians, James visits the various well-preserved battlefields \u2013 one of the first western historians to do so since the end of the Second World War \u2013 to reveal the viciousness of the fighting, the lingering logistical problems both sides faced and the tactical skill and barefaced courage of those who fought in one of the most decisive battles of World War Two. This is the truly epic tale of Britain\u2019s greatest battle.\n\nSign up to History Hit TV and get 14 days free: ", "date": "Jan 10, 2022", "views": "99,248 views", "comments": "837", "likes": "2,053 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4191.501, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhvSVWLJCcQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQS_Wuk_f6g": {"title": "The Viking Berserker at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, 1066", "content creator": "Viking History", "description": "Viking berserkers have got a fierce reputation and were supposedly the best Viking warriors.

With a one in a million chance of meeting one of only 6,000 astrophysicists in the world, audience members were lined up in order to have the opportunity to ask Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson a question on any and all galactic wonders they may have.\n\nAbout St. Petersburg College:\nIn 1927, St. Petersburg College (then known as St. Petersburg Junior College) became Florida's first private, non-profit, two-year school of higher learning located in downtown St. Petersburg. Full accreditation followed in 1931 and in 1948 SPC became a public college. \nIn June 2001, SPJC officially became St. Petersburg College when Florida's governor signed legislation making it the first community college in Florida to offer four-year degrees. On Dec. 11, 2001, the college received the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' accreditation to offer courses leading to bachelor's degrees.\nIn 2002, St. Petersburg College began offering courses leading to bachelor's degrees in Education, Nursing and Technology Management. The college's commitment to its two-year curriculum, which has earned it wide recognition and annually wins it high national rankings, remains as strong as ever.\nToday, SPC has eight learning sites throughout Pinellas County and recently became the first college in Florida to offer a four-year degree in Dental Hygiene. This program's offerings augment its two-year program, which has been in operation since 1963. SPC added four-year degrees in Veterinary Technology, Public Safety Administration and Orthotics and Prosthetics in 2005.\nCollege Accreditation\nSt. Petersburg College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associates degrees and to offer courses leading to bachelor's degrees in the following areas: Banking, Nursing, Business Administration, Orthotics & Prosthetics, Elementary/Secondary Education, Paralegal Studies. Educational Studies. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certification. Dental Hygiene. Public Safety Administration. Health Services Administration. Sustainability Management. International Business. Technology Management. Management & Organizational Leadership. Veterinary Technology.\n \nSPC also offers access to junior and senior level courses for bachelors and graduate degrees at the University Partnership Center.

WFAA filed a complaint with the Attorney General\u2019s Office asking that the AG force the department to comply with its ruling. Over the last six months, the department has released thousands of photos and dozens of hours of body cam and dashcam video.

An innovative cancer therapy promises to save lives. But it is extremely expensive. Will the insurance companies pay for it? What is the manufacturer's return on investment? And do lobbyists drive up prices?\n\nIn 2018, the Kymriah gene therapy was approved in Europe. Immune cells are taken from the patient, genetically reprogrammed into cancer killer cells and returned to the patient as an infusion. The results of the Kymriah study only cover a period of 18 months. In 40 percent of patients, lymph gland cancer does not return during this time. It is not clear whether Kymriah has a long-term effect. The Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis offers the new therapy - it costs 370,000 Swiss francs per patient. Health insurance companies are not usually prepared to pay that much and are complaining about a lack of transparency. \n\nBut the killer cells were not invented in the Novartis laboratories, but at a US university. When Professor Carl June started his research almost 30 years ago, no pharmaceutical company was interested. It was only thanks to funding from tax money and donations that he was able to develop Kymriah at all. After a story went around the world about a girl with leukemia whose cancer disappeared thanks to Kymriah, the pharmaceutical company contacted Novartis and secured exclusive marketing rights. To launch Kymriah on the market, Novartis funded the necessary clinical trials. It's not an isolated incident: Over 60% of newly approved medicines in the US are developed by small biotech companies or universities. Pharmaceutical companies today frequently act as capital providers, cooperating with universities or buying up biotech companies. \n\nA paradigm shift has taken place in the pharmaceutical industry: Whereas high drug prices used to be justified by research costs, the industry is now using the value of gained lifetime to argue its case. \n\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The son of two teachers, he has worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance and wants to step in. But can this really ease inequality?\n\nChristoph Gr\u00f6ner does everything he can to drum up donations and convince the wealthy auction guests to raise their bids. The more the luxury watch for sale fetches, the more money there will be to pay for a new football field, or some extra tutoring, at a children's home. Christoph Gr\u00f6ner is one of the richest people in Germany - his company is now worth one billion euros, he tells us. For seven months, he let our cameras follow him - into board meetings, onto construction sites, through his daily life, and in his charity work. He knows that someone like him is an absolute exception in Germany. His parents were both teachers, and he still worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance. \"What we see here is total failure across the board,\u201d he says. \"It starts with parents who just don\u2019t get it and can\u2019t do anything right. And then there\u2019s an education policy that has opened the gates wide to the chaos we are experiencing today.\" Chistoph Gr\u00f6ner wants to step in where state institutions have failed. But can that really ease inequality? \n\nIn Germany, getting ahead depends more on where you come from than in most other industrialized countries, and social mobility is normally quite restricted. Those on top stay on top. The same goes for those at the bottom. A new study shows that Germany\u2019s rich and poor both increasingly stay amongst themselves, without ever intermingling with other social strata. Even the middle class is buckling under the mounting pressure of an unsecure future. \"Land of Inequality\" searches for answers as to why.

I should have know they would make a big deal considering the other times that i have been to this location and had to do business with this department so im not surprised that this happened. after spending 40 minutes waiting for them to make a single copy of my request because they were crying about putting my name on it and blah blah blah. the lady behind the glass decided to catch an attitude and tell me \" you need to go sit down and behave, your mom would be ashamed\" and \"go sit down and behave yourself\" because i literally said \" hey ma'am can i get a copy of my paper so i can on my way?\" the lady who go mad at me for filming earlier in this transaction then proceeded to call the officers out there to \"help\" me as they put it. luckily i didn't let them intimidate me or lie on me as you can see they try and do all throughout the video. its sad this is how the general public is treated. all i needed was 1 piece of paper copied and it took me over an hour in the police station due to all of the footage because of the length of the encounter i did the best i could to edit out any footage that had no value. i kept every word spoken between me and someone within the building so no one can say i edited the video to make me look better. Also the lady that came in telling a story to the female officer i was talking to was talking about playing online casino games and the people who run the app have access to all hep phones and laptops and they keep deleting her printer off her computer so she cant print anything so she turns off all her devices and puts them under her mattress when she sleeps. the involved parties that i have identified so far are as follows in the order they made contact with me.\n\nAnne Arundel County Police HQ\n(410)-222-8050\nSgt Erin Brandt ", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "49,881 views", "comments": "669", "likes": "1,844 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 2769.901, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=232AZ6jWi_E"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bptr7UvrCbQ": {"title": "The Unsolved True Crime Iceberg Explained", "content creator": "Wendigoon", "description": "Sign up for free and get paid for your opinion:\nhttps://www.influencerlink.org/SH6rJ", "date": "Apr 16, 2021", "views": "2,852,851 views", "comments": "6,845", "likes": "85,083 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 5253.861, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bptr7UvrCbQ"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrKW58MS12g&list=RDCMUCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg&start_radio=1&rv=VrKW58MS12g": {"title": "Glitterbomb Trap Catches Phone Scammer (who gets arrested)", "content creator": "Mark Rober", "description": "I glitterbombed my way up the scammer chain of command.

She will also discuss the ethical challenges of some of these applications.\n\nThe Croonian Medal Prize Lecture is the premier lecture in the biological sciences and is delivered annually at the Royal Society in London.", "date": "Jun 4, 2018", "views": "42,028 views", "comments": "79", "likes": "733 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4771.941, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRz2vck3giU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIMsVSQGBqw": {"title": "CRISPR CAS9 Gene Editing Technique, The Full principle (Part 2)", "content creator": "Biomedical and Biological Sciences", "description": "This video is a full explanation of CRISPR-CAS 9 technique and its utilization in gene editing\nSee also, the principle of CRISPR system:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtOZd...", "date": "Mar 1, 2017", "views": "68,256 views", "comments": "104", "likes": "1,612 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1017.621, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIMsVSQGBqw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ontLP4lGI": {"title": "Nuclear Fusion Breakthrough: China\u2019s Tokamak Fusion Reactor Sets Major Record", "content creator": "TomoNews US", "description": "HEFEI, CHINA \u2014 China's $1 trillion Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak fusion reactor has superheated a loop of plasma to 70 million degrees Celsius, or five times hotter than the sun, for a new record of just over 17 minutes, according to Live Science, breaking the previous record of 390 seconds set by France's Tore Supra tokamak in 2003.\n\nNuclear fusion involves using extremely high pressures and temperatures to induce collisions between hydrogen atoms to make helium, which sees matter converted into light and heat.\n\nThis process is at the heart of how stars are fuelled, and mimicking it is extremely desirable because it does not generate greenhouse gasses, or nuclear waste.\n\nOne key difficulty, though, is that fusion reactors cannot recreate the same intense pressure for the reactions as stars, and thus must operate at much higher temperatures.\n\nControlling plasma at these temperatures so it doesn\u2019t burn through reactor walls, either with lasers or magnetic fields, is extremely problematic technically and, as such, New Atlas clarifies that rather than fusion, the latest experiment tested the Chinese tokamak's ability to tolerate such high temperatures over long periods, sustaining superheated plasma similar to the kind that will eventually be used to create fusion, but for now generating much less energy output than goes into it.\n\nLive Science explains that the Chinese device is ultimately being used to test out technologies for what is currently the world\u2019s largest fusion project \u2014 the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in France \u2014 which is expected to come online in 2025.\n\nNevertheless, its progress remains impressive. The new record, announced on December 31, adds to a previous record set in May, when the same device reached a record plasma temperature of 120 million degrees Celsius for 101 seconds, which was unprecedented.\n\nSOURCES: Live Science, Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences, Futurism, New Atlas, One Zero", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "10,098 views", "comments": "70", "likes": "271 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 678.101, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ontLP4lGI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB53hJcdjIg": {"title": "Everyone Thinks I'm Dumb: Reacting to Your Comments!", "content creator": "Girl Gone London", "description": "If you want to join us on Thursdays for livestreams, become a member of our Patreon community at www.patreon.com/girlgonelondon.\n\nCheck out the Girl Gone London book on Amazon, a humorous and practical guide to life in the UK as an expat: ", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "5,725 views", "comments": "242", "likes": "492 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1487.701, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB53hJcdjIg"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TcVJF7CDPc": {"title": "Prepping - How the SCOTUS Decision STILL Screwed Us All", "content creator": "Pinball Preparedness", "description": "Its all part of the \"Plan\".

While media reports suggest the new policy envisages an end to hostility with India and Kashmir will not stand in the way of trade and business, it's not clear this will happen.\n\nMore likely, this is an image building effort, a way to tell the world that Pakistan has turned over a new leaf while leaving the substance unchanged.\n\nTune in for more in this conversation with Sushan Sareen on StratNewsGlobal's The Gist.", "date": "Premiered Jan 13, 2022", "views": "39,324 views", "comments": "371", "likes": "1,365 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 1336.301, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb40ZjkLgxE"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en06PYwvpbI": {"title": "Are We Ready for the Next Pandemic? - with Peter Piot", "content creator": "The Royal Institution", "description": "2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the deadly Spanish flu.

He first became popularly known for his book, The Tao of Physics, which explored the ways in which modern physics was changing our worldview from a mechanistic to a holistic and ecological one. Over the past 30 years, Capra has been engaged in a systematic exploration of how other sciences and society are ushering in a similar shift in worldview, leading to a new vision of reality and a new understanding of the social implications of this cultural transformation.\n\nRichard Smoley, editor of Quest: Journal of the Theosophical Society in America and author of The Dice Game of Shiva: How Consciousness Creates the Universe, speaks with Capra on the many aspects of this new vision of reality and its implications in how to live meaningful and responsible lives.\n\nFritjof Capra received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1966 and spent 20 years doing research in theoretical high-energy physics, including at the University of Paris, the University of California at Santa Cruz, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Imperial College, University of London, and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California. He also taught at the University of California, Santa Cruz; the University of California, Berkeley; and San Francisco State University. Capra has been the focus of more than 60 television interviews, documentaries, and talk shows in Europe, the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Japan, and has been featured in major newspapers and magazines internationally.

We are NOT the ones who build the church, Jesus Christ is the one that builds His Church.  But because many Christians are lonely and they don\u2019t have a relationship with Jesus where they TRUST Him, they seek after fellowship FIRST.  They are ALWAYS looking for a church, always looking for brothers and sisters in the Lord, always looking for new fellowships and gatherings, people to meet with.  What we SOULD be seeking first is the KINGDOM OF GOD and we should trust that HE is the one who builds HIS Church.  He builds His little flock.  But if we don\u2019t trust Him, we can\u2019t OBEY Him.  Are you really seeing FIRST the Kingdom of God and His righteousness?

The question haunts the film as it haunts Hawking's books.\n\nDr William Lane Craig examines this claim - critiquing both dialogue from the film, and Prof. Hawking's own publications. Does a beginning to the universe entail a creator? Does Hawking's latest \"no boundary\" Big Bang model eliminate the need for God? What hope is there, in a Godless universe? And is philosophy \"dead\" as Stephen Hawking claims?\n\nDr William Lane Craig's Kalam Cosmological Argument is the most widely discussed argument for the existence of God in contemporary western philosophy.

History is now repeating itself around the world.\n\nBased on a book by Professor Richard Werner, a visiting researcher at the Bank of Japan during the 90s crash, during which the stock market dropped by 80% and house prices by up to 84%. The film uncovers how the Bank of Japan pumped up and then crashed the Japanese economy, with an aim of inducing change. Today, what happened in Japan 25 years ago is repeating itself in Europe, with an aim of centralising power in the Eurozone.\n\nThe film shows why it is important for central banks to be accountable and transparent. It also explains how International Financial Organisations such as the IMF seek to impose conditions on countries that are mainly of benefit to dominant Western interests. For anyone interested in understanding recent developments and the significance of the establishment of institutions such as the AIIB and the BRICS led New Development Bank, Princes of the Yen provides the background.\n\nPrinces of the Yen reveals with clarity the control levers that underpin the dominant ideology of the 21st Century. Piece by piece, reality is deconstructed to reveal the world as it is, not as those in power would like us to believe that it is.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa  It's like Netflix for history...

How? They gutted a NASA bill that had already been passed by the House and had made its way to the Senate floor, stripping out the language and replacing it with language that federalizes our elections. \n\nACLJ Director of Government Affairs Thann Bennett explained how this bill was stripped down to be used for hyper-partisan legislation: \n\n\"Can you imagine being the supporters of that NASA authority bill right now when it is now being used to take over elections, move state control of elections to the federal government? You and I both know how hard it is to move a bill through the legislative process. Imagine getting a bill through the United States Senate and it sitting in the House, may even have enough votes to pass in the House, they call it up and remove all of the language that you care about and put in a federal takeover of elections. . . . That is how insistent Washington D.C. Democrats are in taking over control of the elections. It doesn\u2019t even remove that 60-vote threshold, it just pushes it a couple of days later, but that\u2019s how desperate they are to move it down the line.\"\n\nThann added that the substance of the bill is still the same as H.R.1 that we warned you about: \n\n\"It is a federal takeover of elections plain and simple. They changed the bill name from S. 1 the For the People Act, now it is numbered S. 2747 the Freedom to Vote Act and they put Joe Manchin\u2019s name on it. They did very little to change the substance of this. The federal government would still be in charge of everything \u2013 to voter registration, to voter location, to voter hours, to when those polls have to be open, to ballot box security, redistricting would even be under the purview of the federal government now. I am telling you this is as sweeping as H.R. 1 was, they just changed the name and tried to make it a little bit more palpable. . . . The only thing they did with that sleight of hand was get it to the Senate floor. There will still have to be a vote on whether or not they will change the filibuster to actually get it over the line.\"\n\nSenator Schumer is pushing to get rid of the filibuster, yet he used to have a very different opinion on the matter. Senator Tom Cotton pointed that out: \n\n\"Constitutional scholars will tell us that the reason we have these rules in the Senate \u2013 unlimited debate, two-thirds to change the rules, the idea that 60 have to close off debate \u2013 is embodied in the spirit and rule of the Constitution. . . . This is what the Constitution is all about, and we all know it. . . . The bottom line is very simple. The ideologues in the Senate want to turn what the Founding Fathers called the cooling saucer of democracy into the rubber stamp of dictatorship. . . . Those are powerful words \u2013 but they\u2019re not mine. Every word of my speech today was originally spoken by my esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from New York, Chuck Schumer.\"\n\nWhat changed? What changed is that Sen. Schumer and the Left fear the fast-approaching midterm elections, and are terrified of losing their power. They want to federalize elections while they still control the House, Senate, and White House. \n\nSign: NO Federal Takeover of Elections: ", "date": "Jan 13, 2022", "views": "43,812 views", "comments": "306", "likes": "3,527 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 284.401, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anXQ_JRS4pU"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsyNua5gEFk": {"title": "", "content creator": "Screen Rant", "description": "", "date": "", "views": "", "comments": "5,428", "likes": "232,161 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 944.161, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsyNua5gEFk"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY86xyG-hDY": {"title": "The Entire MCU Timeline Explained", "content creator": "Looper", "description": "The massive scope of the MCU has allowed Marvel Studios to create a sprawling, interconnected universe built on a shared continuity, and much like the comics the movies are based on, that means things can get pretty complicated.\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't start with Tony Stark getting kidnapped in 2008, Carol Danvers being taken to Hala in the '90s, or even with Steve Rogers volunteering for the Super Soldier program in the '40s.

Usually terrible, horrible things. The suits are the most uncomfortable thing they\u2019ve ever had to wear. Can you imagine how it would feel to be stuck in spandex in the heat? The itching, the sweating, nearly passing out. Just imagine what it does to your skin! And Tom Holland has gone on record the most, always finding new stories about how horrendous the suit can be. Even Zendaya is concerned for Tom in costume, for one of the weirdest reasons you can imagine. And can you guess which actor said that his costume broke him? We\u2019ll give you a hint, it\u2019s one of the first avengers. Imagine loving your role so much and your outfit just runes the experience for you. We\u2019re taking a look at the Spiderman: Far From Home actors and how much the suits have changed over the years. Did you know it takes most actors 45 minutes to de-suit? And how you need to de-suit before using the bathroom. We\u2019re covering actors from every new Marvel movie, including Spiderman, Eternals, Shang Chi and more, as well as some of our favorite stories from the classics. As it turns out, pretty much every actor has had something bad to say about their costumes. Except for a surprising few who pushed to have their costumes included in the movies more. Can you think of who in the spider-verse was wearing their costume at the oddest of moments? Or which actress called her costars complainers?\n\nSubscribe: ", "date": "Dec 23, 2021", "views": "873,119 views", "comments": "285", "likes": "10,812 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 671.001, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a88SZmG9Cx4"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-fCrXIKW_Q": {"title": "Jon Armstrong's Stand Up Magic at the Magic Castle", "content creator": "Jon Armstrong", "description": "Find out more about Jon Armstrong at www.cardjon.com", "date": "Jul 19, 2015", "views": "50,165 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00EDFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E777F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D72E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D936B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D94546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x01079622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x0112882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F723E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F71443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E7D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E8B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x76E86359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x776087A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x77608774+180]\n", "likes": "Unavailable", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 454.201, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-fCrXIKW_Q"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM61RPgUYIM": {"title": "Cups and Ball Scam on Westminster Bridge in London", "content creator": "John Dawson", "description": "A few years ago, I got duped out of \u00a320 on the Westminster Bridge, in London, by a guy doing the age-old ball in a cup trick (you know, the one with the 3 cups).

Butler, C. West, G.Greenwald and S. Critchley.", "content creator": "Holberg Prize", "description": "The 2021 Holberg Debate: \"Identity Politics and Culture Wars\"\nStarts at 3:00.\n\nDoes identity politics as it is currently manifesting itself offer a suitable avenue towards social justice, or has it become a recipe for cultural antagonism, political polarization, and new forms of injustice?\n\nPanel: Judith Butler, Cornel West, Glenn Greenwald.\nModerator: Simon Critchley\n\nJudith Butler\nJudith Butler is an American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics, queer theory, rhetoric and literary theory. She is the Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School. Butler has written more than 20 books, and her best known works are Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990), Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex (1993), and Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative (1997), in which she challenges conventional notions of gender and develops her theory of gender performativity. Butler argues that being born male or female does not determine behaviour. Instead, people learn to behave in particular ways to fit into society. What society regards as a person's gender can be seen as a performance made to please social expectations, rather than a true expression of the person's gender identity.\n\nCornel West\nCornel West is an American philosopher, political activist, social critic, actor, and public intellectual. West is presently Dietrich Bonhoeffer Professor of Philosophy & Christian Practice at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. He has previously held professorships at Harvard University and Yale University. West focuses on the role of race, gender, and class in American society and the means by which people act and react to their \"radical conditionedness\". A socialist, West draws intellectual contributions from multiple traditions, including Christianity, the Black church, Marxism, neopragmatism, and transcendentalism. He has written 20 books, and among his most influential works are Race Matters (1994), Democracy Matters (2004), and his memoir Brother West: Living and Loving Out Loud (2010). West has a passion to communicate to a vast variety of publics in order to keep alive the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. \u2013 \u201ca legacy of telling the truth and bearing witness to love and justice\u201d.\n\nGlenn Greenwald\nGlenn Greenwald is an American investigative journalist and author. A former constitutional lawyer, he founded and wrote for the online global media outlet The Intercept with Laura Poitras and Jeremy Scahill in 2014 until his departure in 2020, when he moved his writing to the online platform Substack. He is the author of several best sellers, among them, How Would a Patriot Act? (2006); With Liberty and Justice for Some: How the Law is Used to Destroy Equality and Protect the Powerful (2011) and No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the US Surveillance State (2014). Living and reporting in Brazil, he was central to investigations that ultimately helped free Luis da Silva from prison after a parliamentary coup against the former President. Greenwald has received numerous awards for his investigative journalism. In 2009 he was awarded the Izzy Award by the Park Center for Independent Media for his \u201cpath breaking journalistic courage and persistence in confronting conventional wisdom, official deception, and controversial issues.\u201d In 2010 he received an Online Journalism Award for his investigative work on the arrest and detention of Chelsea Manning. In 2013 he led The Guardian\u2019s reporting team that covered Edward Snowden and the NSA, which earned the newspaper the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in Public Service. Foreign Policy magazine named him one of the top 100 Global Thinkers for 2013. \n\nModerator: Simon Critchley \nSimon Critchley is a British philosopher and the Hans Jonas Professor at the New School for Social Research. His books include Very Little\u2026Almost Nothing (1997), Infinitely Demanding (2007), The Book of Dead Philosophers (2009) and The Faith of the Faithless (2012). Recent works include a novella, Memory Theatre, a book-length essay, Notes on Suicide and studies of David Bowie and Football and Apply-Degger (Onassis, 2020). His most recent books are Tragedy, The Greeks and Us (Pantheon, 2019) and Bald (Yale, 2021).

Check out the Intelligence Squared website to hear about future live events and podcasts: http://www.intelligencesquared.com \n__________________________\n\nFilmed at the Royal Geographical Society on 26th May 2015.\n\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks is one of the leading public intellectuals of our times. His book 'The Social Animal', a study of the unconscious mind and the triggers that drive human behaviour, was one of the most talked about publications of 2011. David Cameron instructed all the members of his Cabinet to read it.\n\nOn May 26th, Brooks came to the Intelligence Squared stage to share the insights of his latest book, 'The Road to Character'. Brooks argued that today\u2019s \u2018Big Me\u2019 culture is making us increasingly self-preoccupied: we live in a world where we\u2019re taught to be assertive, to master skills, to broadcast our brand, to get likes, to get followers. But amidst all the noise of self-promotion, Brooks claimed that we\u2019ve lost sight of an important and counterintuitive truth: that in order to fulfil ourselves we need to learn how to forget ourselves.\n\nTo make his case, Brooks distinguished two sorts of virtues: resum\u00e9 virtues and eulogy virtues. Resum\u00e9 virtues are the skills you bring to the marketplace: wealth, fame, status and a great career. Eulogy virtues are the things people will say about you at your funeral: that you were honest, loving, and steadfast. Most of us would say that eulogy virtues are more important, but it\u2019s the resum\u00e9 virtues we tend to think about the most.\n\nBy interweaving politics, spirituality and psychology, and citing examples from some of history\u2019s greatest thinkers and leaders \u2013 St. Augustine, Dwight Eisenhower and Samuel Johnson \u2013 Brooks showed that by cultivating the eulogy virtues we can create depth of character and restore balance to our lives.", "date": "Oct 20, 2015", "views": "89,228 views", "comments": "80", "likes": "1,057 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4906.421, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iGewxH3dgY"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p9aKa08cRI": {"title": "Noam Chomsky: Education For Whom and For What", "content creator": "collegeofsbs", "description": "Noam Chomsky, a world-renowned linguist, intellectual and political activist, spoke at the University of Arizona on Feb. 8, 2012.

Among them: How do we characterize the contemporary state of the American education system? What happens to the quality of education when public universities become more privatized? Are public universities in danger of being converted into facilities that produce graduates-as-commodities for the job market? What is the role of activism in education? With unprecedented tuition increases and budget struggles occurring across American campuses, these are questions that are more relevant than ever.\n\nVideo by Arizona Public Media.", "date": "Feb 10, 2021", "views": "81,429 views", "comments": "Error found: Message: \nStacktrace:\nBacktrace:\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00EDFDC3+2555331]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E777F1+2127857]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D72E08+1060360]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E49E+1238174]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D9E69B+1238683]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC9252+1413714]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7B54+1342292]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DC75FA+1406458]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00DB7976+1341814]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D936B6+1193654]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00D94546+1197382]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x01079622+1619522]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x0112882C+2336844]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F723E1+541697]\n\tGetHandleVerifier [0x00F71443+537699]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E7D18E+2150798]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81518+2168088]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E81660+2168416]\n\tOrdinal0 [0x00E8B330+2208560]\n\tBaseThreadInitThunk [0x76E86359+25]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x776087A4+228]\n\tRtlGetAppContainerNamedObjectPath [0x77608774+180]\n", "likes": "719 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 7167.521, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p9aKa08cRI"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REnxH4EL5Nc": {"title": "The $140BN Plan to Change a Nation with Infrastructure", "content creator": "The B1M", "description": "In the middle of a pandemic, the UK laid out a bold vision for its future \u2013 and its fate lies in the hands of construction.

Developed during the late 1920s, it would become the largest landplane in the world when it first took off in 1929. Despite only two being built in Germany, they would quickly make a name for themselves with Lufthansa as luxurious air liners.\n\nIts main feature was the massive wing, which had a span of 44 meters and was almost 2 meters thick. This allowed it to hold a pair of passenger cabins, 'engine rooms' for mechanics to service the engine, and a large fuel capacity - giving it excellent range and endurance. Unfortunately the aircraft was let down somewhat by its lack of passenger capacity (never exceeding 34), but it was an exciting demonstration of 'big wing' design. The G38 was also built under licence in Japan as the Mitsubishi Ki-20 (or Type 92).\n\n***\n\nProducing these videos is a hobby of mine.

Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and 8 books, including the bestselling The Physics of Star Trek, and the recipient of numerous international awards for his research and writing.  He is an internationally known theoretical physicist with wide research interests, including the interface between elementary particle physics and cosmology, where his studies include the early universe, the nature of dark matter, general relativity and neutrino astrophysics. His soon to be published book, A Universe From Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing is already garnering strong reviews.

David Christian was wounded 7 times receiving 7 purple hearts as well as the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism.

Bill Ehrhardt, who presents his story in my very popular video clip, \u201cMagnificent Storyteller Soldier\u201d shared his personal experience. Many of my subscribers have reacted to it.  I feel that David Christian is an equally powerful storyteller whose war perceptions and experiences were quite different.  In this video he reflects on his early upbringing in the 1950s, his Catholicism, his powerful relationship with his mother, his experiences with college protesters in the antiwar movement, his return to America and his battles to help his fellow veterans deal with PTSD, job opportunities and other issues that they have confronted.

Full accreditation followed in 1931 and in 1948 SPC became a public college. \nIn June 2001, SPJC officially became St. Petersburg College when Florida's governor signed legislation making it the first community college in Florida to offer four-year degrees. On Dec. 11, 2001, the college received the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' accreditation to offer courses leading to bachelor's degrees.\nIn 2002, St. Petersburg College began offering courses leading to bachelor's degrees in Education, Nursing and Technology Management. The college's commitment to its two-year curriculum, which has earned it wide recognition and annually wins it high national rankings, remains as strong as ever.\nToday, SPC has eight learning sites throughout Pinellas County and recently became the first college in Florida to offer a four-year degree in Dental Hygiene. This program's offerings augment its two-year program, which has been in operation since 1963. SPC added four-year degrees in Veterinary Technology, Public Safety Administration and Orthotics and Prosthetics in 2005.\nCollege Accreditation\nSt. Petersburg College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associates degrees and to offer courses leading to bachelor's degrees in the following areas: Banking, Nursing, Business Administration, Orthotics & Prosthetics, Elementary/Secondary Education, Paralegal Studies. Educational Studies. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certification. Dental Hygiene. Public Safety Administration. Health Services Administration. Sustainability Management. International Business. Technology Management. Management & Organizational Leadership. Veterinary Technology.\nSPC also offers access to junior and senior level courses for bachelors and graduate degrees at the University Partnership Center.

Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options\u2014both to rise in the military and to explore other careers\u2014she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life.\n\nIn A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and science\u2014secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they\u2019d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there\u2019s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions\u2014you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn math. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. A Mind for Numbers shows us that we all have what it takes to excel in math, and learning it is not as painful as some might think! \n\nAbout the Author:\nBarbara Oakley is a professor of engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. She has received many awards for her teaching, including the coveted National Science Foundation New Century Scholar Award.\n\nGet the book here: ", "date": "Feb 22, 2015", "views": "1,337,711 views", "comments": "681", "likes": "24,087 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 4121.441, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd2dtkMINIw"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23Xqu0jXlfs": {"title": "Study Less Study Smart: A 6-Minute Summary of Marty Lobdell's Lecture - College Info Geek", "content creator": "Thomas Frank", "description": "Dr. Marty Lobdell's \"Study Less Study Smart\" lecture is an excellent hour-long overview of how to study effectively.\n\nIf you're pressed for time, though, this summary video will give you a good portion of the most useful advice from the lecture.\n\nWatch the original lecture here:", "date": "Jan 29, 2015", "views": "3,785,772 views", "comments": "2,122", "likes": "137,931 likes", "dislikes": " Unavailable", "video_length": 401.321, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23Xqu0jXlfs"}, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yhf0wBFtvY": {"title": "Brutally Honest Advice From Steve Jobs | BEST SPEECH Ever!
